1151,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 is my belief that people are spending too much time on computers. Now a days you can do anything on a computer. Such as, talk to friends, play games, even turn off your lights! But, what are they taking away from us? There taking away communication skills and is same uses creating cyber bullying. They also don't let us enjoy the beauty of nature and exercising. One out of every @NUM1 teens spends more time telling people on the computer then face to face. This way of communication prevents children from learning valuable social skills which come with conversing face to face. This makes @CAPS1 more difficult for children to make friends, or even to do well is work intencies. Studies say by each upcoming generation the communication skills are decreasing by @PERCENT2. Eventually, if @CAPS1 continues to drop at this the will have a world that went. This style of communication has ever a new type of bullying. What have we do to people? You waste over @NUM2 days a year sitting in front of your computer. in this wasted time you could be out going for a jog or walking the day. in fact, the percentage of people that have computer is much greeter than the percentage of people that do not only you exercising for yourself. The computer cant do @CAPS1 for you. Sitting in front of a computer does nothing for your body. You physicaly have to get up and move. Its good for your health, got fresh air. Coming to a point about fresh air @PERCENT1 of people who use computers at home are more likely telecom sick than people who doesnt leave you set seem for sometimes. Seeing nature like never before, I dont think. Yes you can look us the green spotted tree from on the internet, but its nothing like in nature and @CAPS1 is real life. Discoveries cannot be made about new species on the computer, a computer cant find @CAPS1 for your find @CAPS1. People are and less about the environment does to computer. They are seeing a picture not the healthy. After writing this I can te the that I was about myself and personal, which scared me the most I realizes I am becoming more and more dependent on computer each day. I dont seeing friends as. I dont go outside as much, and I don't as much. This true for must people whether you realize @CAPS1 or not I personaly ongoing today and out on time computing you will te. Computer are to much lets for from there hold and deo something more with there lives. This well improve our. So this brings to my final that computers are a bad influence on human and we should use less of them and for ourselves by doing not seeing. Thank you for your time.",5,5,1
1186,"Dear @CAPS1: Some people believe computers benefit society. However, others feel they are too consuming. I for me I belive computers help society. Computers teach hand-eye cordination, give people, and even allows computer to chat online with other people. I'd bet your job requires you to use a computer, you probably even have a personal computer which you like to use to chat with friends. I do that all the time and I like it. Another thing I like are sports. One of my favorite sports is softball. In softball you need to have hand-eye cordination, this will help you swing at the ball more accuratly. When a pitcher throws the ball you have to had the bat at the right angle and watch the ball to know when to swing if kids used computers and become good at hand-eye cordination, then possibly more kids would join a local sports team, and possibly even join travel team. Do you like to travel? I do, and are why I learn about places before I go is by looking that particular place up on the internet. About three years ago I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. I wanted to know what it was like there because I had never gone before, so when I looked it up I found out that they had many torist attractions and ""packages"" that let you swim with dolphins, I was very excited to go and when I did, I had a biast, and to think if I didn't look it up I would not have known what kinds of fun things they had! No wonder so many people like computers! One of the biggest reasons why I like computers is because I can chat with my friends online one main attraction online is @CAPS2, everybody, primarily, has one. Some people have one because they like to look at pictures. I have one because I like to chat with my friends. One night I was chatting with a friend we were laughing having a great time, and then she reminded me that we had science homework due the very next day! I thanked her and then completed my work. You see if kids chat online their friends can remind them of important nescesitys such of homework. This could impove grades by @PERCENT1! So you now see why society needs computers and if you have forgotten let me remind you: computers teach you hand-eye cordiantion, let's you learn about faraway places and people, and now allows you to chat online. Just think what would society be like with no computers.",5,4,1
360,"Do Computers @CAPS1 Society? This question might be answered forever. I have an opinion about this and it might not effect everyone in the world but I do hope so. Exercising, great way to stay in shape but is you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 all day you donÂ’t have a chance to stay in shape. So while everyone is fit you eventually will be fat. Whik you sit there playing the some @ORGANIZATION1 game everyon is out side playing at the park, swimming in the pool or fishing at the lake. Sitling on a @ORGANIZATION1 destroys your life bot physically and socially. Lastly, @ORGANIZATION1 will stop you from spending time with friends and family. Also this will stop you from interacting with new friend, and your old ones will find new ones. Lastly, I you sit on the @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 you will miss out on the awesome @CAPS2 life you were waiting for since you can remember. So the next time your friend says to go online after school, say you'd rather not because you don't want to get addicted.",3,3,0
1716,"People think that useing computers is a good thing, I think so to because there are alot of other people in this country that speak different languages and the computers can teach them insted of a person that just speaks our language. This for some people is their lives even alot of people use computers for their work. Kids also use the internet not for things such as, facebook, myspace, gmail, and alot of other web pages, I also use the internet but not as much anymore but I used to go on gaming pages like, @NUM1.com or even /cup/coffee but I dont go on those anymore that much because I have xbox live and that is a thing that the internet also comes in and you can talk to your friends. Some of my friends just fo on the computer and dont get any exercise at all but alot of my friends go on it but play alot of sports so there not just getting fat all the time. So people in the world basically have a computer but not everyone in @LOCATION2 of @LOCATION1, I think that our country should write a big pay check to those poor country and so they can get computers and so if they come here they can speak our language, or we ship that of computers to their countrys and so they dont buy any crappy computers. Also when your on a computer you can buy a webcam or it is already placed into your computer and you can talk to your friends or even show them that what you made or something like that. So I think that computers are the best thing that we ever invented or who ever do.",3,4,0
1578,"Dear, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I think that although computers are very helpful to socity. Thire also paseing a problem to it for example people are out there that adicted to computers and will in a dark area for hours just on the computer also its not helping the fact that there obessity in @LOCATION2 I explain that to you but any ways this thing that teaching are youth could very much hurt them. Computer junkies what are they? A computer junkie is someone who woke up in the morning at @TIME1 and and stay on it for a good past @NUM1 hours this is a problem that @PERCENT1 of are @CAPS1 youth have topic @MONTH1 be not be big to but it is a problem must know my brothers addict to his laptop he spends hours in his bedroom watching anime japanise cartoons and not eating anything the whole day. Never leaves his room and my mom get so tired of trying to drag him out of his room she just quit and it gets annoying after a while a little computer isnt bad but alot is. Obeasity is a growing problem in are nation and computers arent helping infact computers are making matters worse by having items being shiped to them of in extent of the obesse person getting up used and leaving of they could lose a little wieght and now you can order offline and have it deliverd to your door @CAPS2 @CAPS3 market such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5 domino @CAPS4 and @LOCATION3 jade have been a part of this issue stop online @CAPS3 ordering. The computer is a great way to learn about things but it also a great way to become a junkie and fat:",4,5,0
945,"Dear Newspaper, In my opinon I think computers do have a positive affect on people. They can learn about far away places. They let people talk online. It can even help you find a job. This is why I think computers are very positive. Certainly, people can learn about far away places on the computer. Say, someone wanted to take a trip to @LOCATION1 they can look it up, learn the launage. They can by tickets. They could also find interesting things to see in that country. These reasons are why I think a computer is a positive technology. My next reason I think a computer is positive toward people is that people can comuicate online. This can help keep families in touch. It can help you find and talk to old friends (facebook). You can even make new friends to talk to. These are other examples why I think computers are positive. My last reason I think computer have a positive affect on people is that it can help you with jobs. It can help you find a job. It can also help you with your job. Lastly, it can have you have a higher position at your job. These are my reasons I think computers are important and positive to people. For all the reasons above are reasons I think computers are an awesome =) and positive technology, I mean just look at all the reasons. They let people talk online. They can also teach you about far away places. And even help you with your job. This is why I think computers have a positive affect on people.",4,4,0
1783,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 several reasons on way I that advances in technology are harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers on the outside world. Its also takes you away from family and friends. Lastly it also takes you away from enjoying life outside of the internet. One of my severl reasons on way I feel advanced technology is harmful to our socitey is because it opens doors to strangers @CAPS2 teens, adult's and etc. The probem with this is that you never really know whos on the other side of that door, that chat room people can miss guide you into thinking there someone who there not. @CAPS2 example theres a show called dateline. This show is about how young teens put there selev's online and grown or young men click on a picture of you and that opens up a chat line or as I say opening a door, you dont know who's on the other side of that door. So these men online makes these teens trust them and make them feel safe if they are a friend you ""hey can I come over sometime?"" you this young teen thinking thats your friend says yea sure. Dont forget you dont see his picture so he come's over and most of three men are looking @CAPS2 a quick fix. If you know what I mean. This is what go's on during dateline t.v show just imarge how many other kids or teens are out there doing the same thing the difference is they dont get caught. Secondly on why is harmful to our socitey is because it takes you away from your family and friends. It takes you away from your kid's family because that will start to fill as if you love that computer more then them. It take you away friends because they might say hey let's go out to the mall or @CAPS2 a drink youll probably say check up on somethings online. This will one move slowly away from you, all over a computer you will start to lose the people most important to you. My last reason on why you can harm society with teconogly is because it takes you away from living your own life and doing thing's you wanna do like online is a bunch of stuff that everybody else say's is cool. Do what you think and feel is cool. @CAPS2 example if someone posted something saying @NUM1 guys lodon is so cool you gotta go there but youve always wanted to go to @LOCATION1, @CAPS3 thing is that you do get to have enough air outside like your skin will get pail and icky and this is why I feel that way. In covlsion all though some people might think that advanced tencogly is good well cleary there not because they open doors to danger, take you away from friends and family. Also it takes you away from what life has to offer.",4,4,0
1760,"I think we can all agree that computer usage is a very controversal issue. In my opinion, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people. For instance, it's not safe and children can get into all sorts of things on the internet. Also, people spend too much time in front the computer now a days, @CAPS1, its a major distraction and also a negetive effect on kids. school work. It's now or never! Do we dicide that computers have a negetive effect? You decide! Isn't every parents biggest concern the safety of their children? When on the internet, kids are capable of accessing anything and everything. Sometimes kids don't even look for bad things, they just pop up. Would you want your child veiwing things that you have no control over? Also, websites like @CAPS2.com one one of the greatest concerns when it comes to internet safety. Although you are supposed to be at least @NUM1 to have a @CAPS2, most kids lie about their age. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS2 users lie about their age? And it's not always a @NUM4 year old saying they are @NUM1, it could be a @NUM6 year old saying they're @NUM7! Not only do people lie about their age, they lie about who they are. Is this the kind of internet exposer you want for your children? Put a stop to this right now! More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are overweight and unhealthy. This is another negetive effect computers have on people. It's a gorgeous @DATE1 day. Bright blue skies, cotton candy cloulds, the sun is shining, and there's a nice warm breece. Perfect day to go out and get active, right? Wrong! None people would @CAPS5 be inside on the computer. Instead of going for a walk, people would @CAPS5 spend hours on facebook. This is a serious concern to our health. People don't exercise enough as it is, and then when you add computers, people will never get active! Instead of playing video games onlin, people need to be reminded that turning off the computer and playing a fun beighborhood game of baseball is just as fun and much more beneficial. This is just one step @CAPS3 need to take to get a healthier lifestyle. Wouldn't you agree? Did you know that kids that spend more time on computer are more likely to do poorly in school? Surely, if nothing else will convince you of the negetive effects of a computer this will @CAPS5 than coming home and doing homework, more time is spent in front of the computer. As a student, I will admit that the computer is a very tempting distraction and can easily pull a student away from their studies. You can't expect a child to make the right decision and tell their they have to go because they need to study. So you do! Take action now, or your child will definately suffer. The time has come to decide. Do you believe Computers have a negative effect on people? It's clear that the computer is not safe. Not to mention, too much time is spent on the computer instead of being active. Most importantly, computers will negetively affect children's grades. Don't wait another minute! Let's agree and do something about this!",6,6,1
813,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you know any child or teen between the age of eight and seventeen who doesn't live to go on the computer? Well myspace, facebook and aim is like a online hangout. Kids every where log on and don't log out unless the parent of the child makes them. I firmly belive that computers have major effect on people, my three reasons are people don't have the exersise, they dont interact with others, kids are smocky they will sneak on if doing research for if wasnt . Online websites and games are like hipnotysing the people and making them stay on for hours. Most parents belive that having their child on a computer doing research for an hour is good; however kids are and would sneak to pay online going or go to a website they were not allowed to go on and wasnt on before. Sometimes the best thing to @CAPS1 is get some fresh air and interact with others. Buth with websites that make people stay conect for more than two hours they dont get fresh air and they dont interact with others . Most times people forgot and dont know what something is except for how a computer because they play on it so much. People grow up fast when you think about it, and people start to eat, drink, sometimes sleep at the computer. People stay at the computer and eat their, they wont get enought exercise, they will start to get fat and soon an only stay at the computers because they didnt exercise burn the fat off. How you see how computers have a major effect on people by not interacting with others, not having enough, and kids wife sneaky and will go on other website, they wer not allowed to go on and if thier parents wernt home.",4,4,0
1725,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a world where nobody has any hand-eye coordination @CAPS6 they try to cath a ball it slips away. There are no friendships or communication with other countries. Is this really what you want? Computers do have positive effects on people. For example, they help with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Computers have a positive effect on people and the society. First, hand eye-coordination is not something that all people have. However, you can make it better by using computers and that is a fact. Computers @CAPS4 said that computer help @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 with their hand-eye coordination. For example, my mom used to have horrible hand-eye coordination but now that she uses a computer and it is much better. Oprah said, Â“ @CAPS6 I was young I couldnÂ’t catch a ball but now that IÂ’m older and using computers IÂ’m the best.Â” @NUM1 out @NUM2 people agree that computer help hand-eye coordination. Next, computers help other people learn about faraway places. For example, if we didnÂ’t have computers people wouldnÂ’t travel to @LOCATION1. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 agree that they would never travel if it werenÂ’t for computers it is a fact that people use the internet to learn about other countries for educational purposes. Www.exploretheworld.org wrote that @PERCENT2 of the people who use the website are students. Computers help other people learn about far away places. Finally, computers allow people to talk online. @PERCENT3 of people on facebook have at least one friend who live out of this country. It is a fact that countries are better allies @CAPS6 their people get along.Www.internationalfriendships.com wrote that they have over @NUM3 users who talk with people from other countries for example, my friendÂ’s mother was born in @LOCATION2 and she talks online with many of her friends. Dr @PERSON1 said,Â”@CAPS8 friendships are the best kind because you learn about other cultures.Â” Computers are a wonderful way to talk to other people. Now @CAPS3 a world where every country got along because of online friendships. Where adults could play a game of baseball because they got their hand eye-coordination back. Where students could learn about distant places they didnÂ’t know existed. Does't that sound great? Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places and allow people to talk online. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 computers do benefit the society.",5,4,1
1706,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers have a good effect on people and not a bad effect. I think this for three reasons. My first reason is that they relieve stress. Without a computer in my opinion things would be a lot more stressful. With a computer you can easily look things up without wasting time or being stressed out by having to look for something. My second reason for thinking computers have a good effect on people is technology. Without technology things would be so much harder. Without computers it would be harder to neatly type assignments, print out pictures, and getting information. If we didn't have technology as in computers I think a lot or things would go wrong. My third reason for thinking computers have a good impact on people is that without them factories would crash. i say this because if you think about it could in a factory is ran by some type of computer. Without that computer telling the machines what to do everything practically wouldn't work! without the computer everything would become so time consuming that no one would want to get the work done. These are my three reasons why I think computers have a good effect on people.",3,3,0
303,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The use of computers does not benefit our society. Instead of spending time with the people we love, like friends and family, our time is knawed up by the one electronical device that many people depend on; the computer. This is not a very good thing to have an electronic device like this in our ever day lives because it uses a lot of electricity, it is expensive to buy and replace, and it allows hackers or other bad people into things we dont want them to see. But using electricity is @CAPS4 the start. By using electricity for this nonsense device, we waste money. We also are doing our part to destroy the environment. Greenhouse gasses and fuel are poisoning the air and being wasted. ""I don't have a computer at my house, and I get along pretty well."" @CAPS3 a local environmentalist. So that's @CAPS4 it; we can get along well without the computers taking over our lives. Along with not being good for the environment, it is also not good for the economy. My dad always @CAPS3 how he doesn't like to waste money, and then he goes and purchase a computer. Not only has this computer crashed once, but twice! A waste of money has been put into buying it, restoring it once, and now restoring it a second time! Plus computers waste our time. I always remember my grandfather saying "",I don't know why you folks waste all your precious time and money on these doo-dads!"" With so many people aquiring new devices, fewer people will be able to keep track of what goes where and who sees it. This is a terribele thing for the people, but a very, very good thing for the bad people. By ""bad people"" I mean internet hackers. As time goes on, and people get less aware of what's happening in their electronic lives, more and more hackers will be able to get what they want; in fact, anything they want. ""@CAPS4 a few months ago, I put a message on the message board on the @CAPS5 website which said I would be on vacation for a week. My address was also posted, because that message was a mobile upload. When I came back from vacation, half the things in my house were gone!"" said a local resident. Burglaries, robberies, and internet access can lead to chaos. Feeble protection is never good.

Please understand the meaning how terrible computers are.",5,5,1
138,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 has been a lot of discusion of whether computers effect people in a positive way or in a negative way. I believe that computers effect most people negatively. I think this because people lose their people skills"" by talking through the computer, computers @MONTH1 also lead to danger, and because people tend to forget about their priorities in life. From what i know. most people that use computers use them to talk to friends and other people around the world. Instead of hangingout with their friends they talk through the computer and if that what they do, more than hanging in person then they won't reconize the facial expressions given to them by certin people, while talking in person you get the full on experience of communicating with them. You get the tome of voide in addition to the facial expressions. You also get the body language which you can't get from on the computer unless you are using webcam. Computers have led to many dangers. These dangers effect every user and their families. @CAPS1 have been many cases of young teenagers being tricked by ader users into showing them parts of their body to making the teens believe that the older user can relate to their problems and are the same age. sometime the teen is persuade to leave their home and neighbor hood to meet the other user. Also, another type of danger is cyberbulling. Cybe bulles lower yourself-esteem. The bullies call you names and pick on you and sometimes make you feel suicidal. If we hadnt had any computer then none of these dangers would be occuring. With computers people have lost their judgement in top priorites. Some computers uses tend to forget about the important things in life such as family, schools work, and their own health. Some people would rather stay on the computer than hangout with family and friends. Others tend to choose not to do their homework and work on their social life on the computer instead. Since they are on the computer alot they seem to ignore their health. They don't exercise as much and don't eat as healthy. So in my opinion, life without computers would be good for everyone. People would still have the people skills they had before, their wouldn't be as much danger, and people would focus more on the important thins than their online social lives.""",4,6,0
833,"Dear Local Newspaper, Are you spending all your precious time on a computer? On the computer your probably wasting every second searching or playing games. You shoudn't spend alot of time on the computer it will just wash away your brain. You shoudn't go on computers for a long time because instead you should be exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. First of all, spending too much time on the computer is not good for you because you should be out exercising. On computers you can't jog the fat you gain by eating food. By jogging instead of going on the computer you can lose weight and see the real world than the world behind the computer screen. Nevertheless computers are fun to go on like playing addicting games. but isn't it better to play a real sport like soccer. In soccer you have to use your mind and alot so it is much better than sitting or laying around dazed at a computer screen for a long period of time. Don't you love playing outdoor games! Like playing tag or hiding go seek isn't that more fun than playing an addicting game on the computer screen? For me I think it is. That is my reasons I think you should exercise then stare at the computer screen. Secondly, you shouldn't be on the computer for a long amount of time because you should instead be enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful and refreshing unlike a computer. Yeah I know computers offer alot but do they offer the fresh air outside, the warm breeze land living animals the earth. I don't think so and neither should you. Instead of going on your computer when it is raining not you should play with your pets and if you don't have any put a raincoat umbrella and go outside. Especially in the @DATE1 you should be outside enjoying nature go for a swim or bring your annoying little siblings to the park. There is more to often in use than going on the computer. More importantly, you shouldn't go on the computer because you are better off. Interacting with living people in person. On the computer talking to people you are going no where on the computer chatting with people it is impossible to read someones expression. So get off the computer and hang with your family and friends. Get into a fun conversation or debate. Make new friends when your at the mall or discovering a new trail in a park. Do anything but interact on the computer when all you see is typed words writing back to you. Get your self out in the world don't just interact with people but the world not the computer screen. In conclusion you shouldn't spend most of your precious time on the computer. It isn't nessasary for you to spend all your time on the computer when you could be exrcising, enjoying nature and interacting with people. I strongly beleive people should be outside than on a computer. So what are you waiting for get off that computer and take a hike!",5,4,1
1066,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 there is alot of talking and arguing about computers. Some say they are helpful to society and others say not. As for myself I am one of those on the side of which is for computers. I think the do alot less harm than good. First of all the hand-eye cordination of the user is mostly improved over a period of time, which helps withe learning musical instruments. Also it gives a great learning ability to people, particularly student. If there were computers, for a student to do a report he/she would have to read through an encyclopedia, which takes a great amount more time than plainly looking it up on the internet. Finaly computers are great for communicating with far-away friends or family. The first subject on my agenda is the hand-eye cordination skills. These skills are the ability to work with your hand and eyes simultaniously. There is a number of impacts these skills can make. The most apparent is musical instruments. If you are trying to learn a new song to be played on guitar you must move your fingers to the notes coresponding with the screen. Another place where hand-eye cordination comes in handy is sports. One sport where hand eye cordination makes a huge impact is in football. If the ball is thrown then the wide recever must watch the ball with his eyes and make sure he puts his hands in the best position to catch the ball. I am also going to argue the vost world of learning that is provided by computers. Lets just say someone asks you who was the @NUM1 president of the @ORGANIZATION2 where would you go to find that answer? I don't know about you but I am definatley going to look it up on google (internet search engine). Also schools @CAPS1 can ask alot more of their students because they have all this information at there desposal. Lastly I would like to cover the communications abilitys that the computer puts out there. First of all let say you have a very close friend move out-of-state"" how are you going to keep in touch. You could try using phones but yet the long-distance fees have sky-rocketed over the past @NUM2 years. Did you know that if you talk long distance for @NUM3 mins a day that would be over @NUM4 a month. in todays ecconmy you need to save money not talk it all away. The internet charges no additional fees for chatting no matter how far away you are from each-other. So hopefully my letter will be able to surposs ""@CAPS2'bama's failed health care bill"" to at least make it somewhere in the paper. People need to know the facts about computers before they try to argue about them.""",5,4,1
275,"Dear @PERSON1, Advances in technology and computers is a bad thing. When the computer company's such as @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION2, and @ORGANIZATION1, make cool updates to their computer systems people do not want to shut their computer off, which is not a good thing. As a child did you spend all of your time indoors and online? Computers take time away from spending time outside, or exercising. And they affect very crucial family time. Computer advances are bad for our country and town. Now-a -days, kids would much rather spend time on their computers than outside. This can have a very negative affect. First of all, it is important that students see and feel nature, and last time I checked they can not do that on a computer. Children need to see animals, smell the sweet scent of flowers and feel the breeze brush against their cheeks. A second reason that going outside is important is for the sun. Even though the sun does have harmful days, it is still important for health that everyone spends some time in the sun. The computer takes times away from nature which is unhealthy and dangerous. Computer also take precious time away from exercise. If people spend all their time on computers, then do they exercise. Everyone is supposed to get at least @NUM1 minutes of activity daily, but no one ever spends that much time working out. Also, obesity numbers have increased greatly since the invention of personal computer and the internet. Obesity can make life difficult for people and can also lead to disease. Life with computers has lead to less people exercising and obesity rates increasing. Another issue computers cause is that people are spending less time with their families. Family is one of the most important things in the world and everyone should spend a few hours daily with their family. Plus with encouregement from their family, many students excel in school and sports, which gives them graet self-confidence. Computers take time away from something that should be thw most important to everyone, family. Many people are affected negatively by computers. The technology takes very important time away from children and adults. It takes time away from the outdoors, exercising, and family. Yes, computers @MONTH1 make life easier, but they have a much more negative affect than they do a positive one.",6,5,1
1529,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I rencently started researching the effects that computers have on people an have found some shocking facts. I do not belive computers benefit society at all. Three reasons why I believe this is because it makes people lack exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends @CAPS1 is a rising problem in @LOCATION1 and a major factor towards @CAPS1 is computers. In fact statics so that people who spend more time exercising than looking at electronics all day actully live longer lives. So my first reason about why computers do not benfit society is that it lets people lack exercise. People need exercise to live and with computers it is becoming more lacking than ever. Also, exercise give you interfines a not more that makes you happy if you live your life exercising instead of watching or doing violant things on the web that will lead to a less violant future. My second reason is that computers cause a lack of enjoying nature. Nature is a beautiful thing filled with simmering lakes, the beautiful scent of balsam fine, and thosands of creatures. With computers thoshands of kids are missing out on the fresh air and adventures that nature has in store. My parents didn't have computers when they were little and they say that they enjoyed running around their neighborhoods playing sports and other fun activities. Finally, computers lack in interacting with friends. Remember when you were little and you called up your friend to hang out and sleepover, well now computers have caused people not to have to call or hang out with friends. Instead you can just @CAPS2 or email them and @CAPS3 you can have a conversation without even looking at a person! In closing, computers cause a lack in exercise, enjoying nature, and interacting with friends. Please help and encourage others to help me put a stop to computers! Thank you for your time and I hope you learned some shocking and interesting facts from this letter. ",4,4,0
525,"Dear Local Newspaper, I feel that computers are very beneficial to our society. They are very helpful when it comes to homework, you can talk to people online and you can make plans/ without even leaving your house. First of all, computers help us a great deal with homework. Many kids are adamant about it, but with the help of a computer, they will be more willing to get it done. For example, when I have a difficult science/social studies assignment, I can research it on the computer. Also, @CAPS1 I have a just coming up and I left my textbook at school, I can just study on my computer. So, as a result, computers are very helpful with homework and studying. Secondly, computers make it very easy to communicate with others. For example, talking on the phone costs money, and why would you money when you could text, chat voice for free? Also, many people use e-mail because its very easy and you can send documents to others. Lets say, that I had a work document on yearly company profits and I needed to got it to my boss. No problem, I just it to an email and I don't have to drive. Finally, my last point, computers make it very easy to make plans or connections. I know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love to travel, but you need plane tickets. Just go to the website and do it online. Its fast, easy and safe. Also, @CAPS1 you needed to make reservations for something, like a hotel, you just have to go online, pick a date and when you arrive your room will be ready. I can see how this would be very beneficial to traveling business men who might need a room for the night. In conclusion, computers play a huge roll in the world because they can help with homework, its easy to communicate, and you can make /reservations without even leaving your house. And the best part about them is that they are fun and easy to use!",5,4,1
1614,"Dear @CAPS1 I think that computers are beneficial to our society for example, computers are very helpful to everybody. Computers alsi travel nows faster. And they can teach us new things. I am not saying computers donÂ’t have their downs, but, computers also have their ups. Computers are very helpful in many ways. They help people find lost fmaily members, and they help police officers find many criminals. Haven't you lost soemone in your family, or haven't spoken to them in years and always wanted to find them and get back in with them? Well that's what computer are for. Aslo haven't you been concern about the many criminals on the street, and wanted to get them of the streets and in jail where they belong but didnt have a way to do that? Computers  help. Haven't you notice that computers are  help police many women in the present time? Computers  people in the , but they help travel fastre for example say you heard there was hurricane or tornado and you needed to find out how . All you have to do is on the computer and look it up. Also, there an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and the didn't information to help you. You would just go on the computer and find all the information you need. COmputers are of many things for they you. Computers teach you alot, like hand-eye cordiantion. Think about it, you might on hte computer that, but it helps. If you yourself while you are on the comp[puter you would start to see that you are typing fastre and learning where all the letters are on the keyboard now, then when you saw your first computer. Computers though, not only teaches you hand-eye cordination but it also teaches you of many wonder places. Such as @CAPS2 falls, rain forests etc. Now, dont get me wrong, @CAPS3 not saying that computer dont their downs and that people dont take advantage of computers. but, I am saying that they help society alot. They travel news fatser. Also they taught alot to people. So take my opinion into consideration. And think about how much computers have done for you.",5,4,1
361,"Computers have a very positive effect on people. Computers help people in many ways. They teach people about history and faraway places. They also are a great way to yourself. Computers also are another way to comunicate to people for away it only a few houses down. Computers have a of knowledge and more is added everyday. Everyday i go on the computer i learn something new. You can search the word @LOCATION1 and instantly have millions of web pages in fron of you that all had new knowlage and exciting things about @LOCATION1. Computers are much faster than having to go down to local library and look for a book that has the information you need. You can also find diffrerent veiws and perspectives of a subject online. Depending on what website you go to you can get opinions on certain places and events, which you cannot find books at the library. Computers have a amount of knowledge instantly and also some opinions of things. Computers can also entertain you. There are many entertaining website online that you can go to when you bored. There are books and magazines you can read at anytime you want. If you like to read then check online, these @MONTH1 be a book you enjoy free of charge to read. Some people like to play games. On the computer you can find almost any game you want to play. These are board games, video games, strategy game, adventure games, and many many more than that. I could go on for hours listing at the different types. If you like sports you can look on the internet and find pages about different sports. You could find ways to improve how you play or you to play that sport. If you like to watch @CAPS1. you can also do that on a computer. Some @CAPS2.V programs put the diffrent episodes online so people can easily view them just by one click of the mouse. Computer can anybody who uses it. Computers help tech you things entertain you. but they also can communicate to your friends and family. Many programs let you to people through the internet. You could send emails to your cousin half way across the world. In emails you can attach pictures and files with text to communicate. These are various programs. IM means instant messaging, that means that instantly you message to another person using that program. You put a message in and away it goes instantly reaching ther person you trying to teach. Now thse are even more to communicate. you can make audio calls to a person using the computer. It is like a phone just not.Web cams make it possible to record and send video instantly, but can also uses to talk to one through a video call. The program connects you to your friends or family and you can see them thourhg a video. computers are a great way to comunicate with others. Computers help in a positive way. They give you access to an amazing amount of information. They can you. Computers also great way to communicate to people no matter how far away that person is. I would completly say that computers are a positive thing.",5,5,1
383,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers are good for providing us with useful information? I @CAPS2. This is only one of the reasons why I agree with the use of computers. The reasons are: They provide us with information for learning, they allow us to communicate with people, and they provide entertanment. However, I @CAPS2 understand why someone would oppose than. Let me explain my point of view. Whenever I need to @CAPS2 or know something that I don't know about, I go to my computer and look it up. Many seach engines such as @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS3 and @LOCATION1 allow us to input a question or phase and gives us links to other websites that hold information about the topic we are trying to learn about. Another way computers help us learn is because we can download and install software that help us with things like learning a forgian language or even just practicing math. For example, my grandfather wanted to learn how to speak @CAPS4 but he didn't have time to go to classes. So he ordered a program that teaches him how to speak @CAPS4 while he is home. Another reason why I think that computers benifit society is because it allows us to communicate with other people. One way is through social sites where you have a profile and you can ""chat"" with your friends by typing in what you want to say. Another way is through video chat. This is when you have a webcam and you can see and talk to other people. I think that this is very important because @PERCENT1 of people that the computers leads people to become ""anti-social"". It also helps you connect with old school friends and relatives that are far away. This @MONTH1 actually improve some people social if they are shy. @CAPS2 you like music, movies, and more? Well you have axcess to the through your computer. This is yet another reason how computers can benefit us. If you are going somewhere that you think your kids will be bored all you have to @CAPS2 (if you have laptop) is put a movie in for them to watch. Another way that computer provide entertainment is they let us listen to music. If you have an ipod or @NUM1 player you can download the music from the computer. It also provides us with entertainment if we are interested in playing video games. There is entertainment for everyone. Even though I support the use of computers I understand the negitive effect they have on many people. Some of those things are: people stop excersiceing and become over weight, they @MONTH1 become less interactive with other people, and they @MONTH1 not spend as much time in the fresh air. In conclution, I think that computers can benefit our society. The reason why I think this are: they provide us with information, allow us to communicate, and provide us with entertainment.",6,5,1
705,"What is more fun, stairing at a blank computer screen all day, or spending the day out in beutifull nature with your friends and family? Well, if you don't know, I do. I took a survey at my school with the same exact question and @PERCENT2 of the kids said that hanging out with friends and family is much more than spending all of your time on the computer, and there are three reasons why they said that. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, than in person. Next it's unhealthy, and lastly alot of bad things can happen on the internet. So, if you are interested in this topic please keep on reading and I will prove that the computer is not a good way to spend your spair time. Do you know what computers were intended to do? Computers were you people, but have for one second that instead of interacting with people you should interact with the people around you. Instead of going on facebook/myspace to talk to your friends, just them over. If you do that its not only more fun, healthier for you. So next time anything else just think the other options. In my last paragraph didnt I say that hanging out with friends is much more healthier then being? Well I was absolutly @PERCENT1! Did you know that when you waist your only hurting yourself? Well, you are when all your doing is sitting down stairing at a screen you are not doing anything to help your self because you are get absolutly exercise. When your not on the computer at least walking a little bit, but typeing doesnt do anything for you. Thats why people shouldn't spend all of their time on the computer. Have you ever heard of an internet preditor? Well if you let me just sum it up for you. An internet preditor is someone that uses the computer to get people they dont know do inapropriate things. And did I say it was against the law, because it is. So if you you ignore friend because if you dont, bad things. And tahts just one of the reasons why people spend as much time on the computer. So, now you know why people shouldnt spend as much time on the computer as they usually do. First, instead of talking to people on the computer, go in person. Next, it's unhealthy, and lastly, internet preditors. So the next time you open your laptop, just think is it more fun stairing at a blank computer screen or spending the day in beutifall nature with friends and family? And always remember what the is.",4,4,0
948,"I am so happy, I just finished my school report on @PERSON1 and I didn't even need to leave my house. I was able to talk with my classmate and ask her questions online. I also managed to get all the information just from my computer. I also learned how to row a boat, to show my class how @LOCATION1 crossed the @CAPS1 river, I learned that by taking on online course. This is one situation why computers have fantastic effects on people in everyday situations. Local research show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 planning their vocation use the internet. The reason these citizens use internet is to get the information about the hotel and vacation cite. That is one way that makes computers helpful and positive devices, beacuse it makes it easier for busy @CAPS2 to get ready for a trip by looking at pictures of the hotel online and getting all the info they need. Doctor @PERSON2 of @CAPS4 university says ""computers now offer programs that allow busy @CAPS2 to learn a new skill, @PERCENT2 of @CAPS2 currently use this software. ""@CAPS7 everyday @CAPS2 don't have time to go out a join a group or class to learn new skills. That is why computers are so helpful and people just love them. Instead of leaving home they can be cooking, doing yoga, or speaking a new language all from their computer at home. That is another reason why computers are useful in vey positive ways. Imagine forgetting your homework at school and not be able to an A in that class. Well because of computers forgetful students can talk to a classmate online and get the homework and do it. Or they could even use the internet to go to that school website and find the homework and print it out. Many students around the country forget homework once in a while, because of helpful computers they can fix their problems easily. Let's recap, students or adults can get information off the internet for projects or even vacations. Busy @CAPS2 who don't have time to leave their house can take a class or learn a new skill right on the computer. Anyone can use the internet to talk or chat online to get school work or to long distance friends. That is why the effects on computers to people are nothing but positive. Now what can you do? It is important that computers stay in our lives, they are helpful and we have learned to live with them, which is why they must stay. This benefits you because newspaper houses are organized by computers and it keeps you business running.",4,5,0
785,"Dear local newspaper, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computer. This illustrates that computers must have an positive effect on people if most people own them. I believe computers do have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online, learn about new things, and gives you hand eye coordination. My first reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ability to talk to other people online. Some people dont have phones but do have computers. If you needed to contact somebody you could do it using a computer. Also some people have family and friends who live across the world. Computers are great for keeping in touch, it also wont cost you a lot for long distance, like phones would. Because computers give you the ability to talk to friends, family, and other people it is a positive thing because it is important to do so. My second reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it gives you the ablity to learn about new things. Learning about new things using a computer gives a positive effect on people because you dont have to travel and go places to get information to learn about things. You could do by a click of a button. People could use the computer to learn about anything or everything. Being able to not have to leave your home to gather information about new things gives a positive effect on people because now more people will be able to learn more because they have more time than they would traveling places to get information. This is a positive effect on people because the more you know the better. Having a lot of knowlage is a good thing and will do good things for you in the future. My third reason why I believe computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches people hand and eye coordination. Having hand and eye coordination gives a positive effect on people because your going to need it through out live. If you dont have good hand and eye coordination, it is a bad thing because you use it for just about every thing, such as driving, writing, and excercizing. Computers give you the ablity to learn eye and hand coordontion throughout life which is why it is a posite thing for people. I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the ablity to talk online to people, learn about new things and teaches you hand and eye coordination. I hope this letter persades you to believe that computers do have a positive effect on people.",4,4,0
512,Dear People Computers are not a really good thing because @CAPS1 you think about it you never want to get off allways chating or social networking you can allways find something to do but you are wasting your time on the computer you can do anything you want but I think to much is a waste of time. @CAPS1 you have kids you would not spend time with them you can help your kids with there homework eat with them watch t.v spend time relax but some people like laydys with kids go online and never get off you have to have time with your kids so they dont have bad habbits so they dont stay out to late. You have to have time for your self clean the house cook food for your husband go out shopping take your kids out to the mall just enjoy your life computer gives nothing to us just gets us layzy. @CAPS1 you work you have to think about your work maybe hang out with your friends dont be on the computer for @NUM1 you can do other stuff call your friends over or go shoping do cleaning in your house computer does not give us anything its just waste of time @CAPS1 you social network.... There is good thing about computers you can find anything you need look at stuff talk to family from far away. @CAPS1 you use it in good ways its a good thing but @CAPS1 you never log off faccebook or other stuff its not good to stay on. You can just go to the beach or go to the gym you have lots of stuff to do other then going online and sitting for hours. Just try not to go online and just go out and go somewhere insted...,4,4,0
191,"Dear The @CAPS1, I understand that you have some concerns about computers. I don't think you should be concerned though. You should not be concerned because computers are very posotive. They teach us hand-eye coordination, help teach you about faraway places and people, and finally you can talk online with familly and friends. First, computers teach you hand-eye coordination. There are thousands of fun games online that can help improve your reflexes and eyesight. This can help heal or improve some people reflexes by making their eyes more keen. Another thing amazing about computers is that you can learn about far away places and people. This is very helpful because if you want to travel somewhere far away but you can't, you just go to your computer and look it up. Then you feal like you are really there. It can also help you study about people that live far away and that you won't get to meat in person. Finally when you go on your computer you can go online and talk with your family and friends. There are all types of websites you can go on to talk and hang out with with all of your friends and family. The computer is very helpful because it keeps your family and friends together and happy. In conclusion I think computers are a great, fun, and helpful invention. Remember these good characteristics that computers have and please don't take computers away; we need them.",4,4,0
718,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A regular day for a person, with a computer, includes at least three hours using the computer per day. Today, people, especially teens, spend their precious hours wasting time on sites like facebook, myspace @CAPS1 and more! Just think about it, just sitting in a chair with your eyes gluded to the computer when you could be exercising, spending time with family and friends or enjoying nature? After all do we really need a computer? Obesity is one of the highest concerns in the country today. However, we can prevent it! We are certainly not helping this issue when we have childre. Adults sitting in a chair for a large part of their day doing absolutley nothing! We are so fortonate, our town has at least two physical fitness buildings for anyone can attend instead of using the computer. ANd even if you can't attend a gym you could easily walk around your neighborhood. There are running program held at our local beach, @LOCATION1, where you can exercise or even run a small competition! Please exercising is key to everybody's health and there are numerous ways to exercise, but using the computer is not one of them! Teachers, parents, children writers everyone lets stay away from the computers and stay fit! Family and friends are those who make us truly hapy but if we on the computer how are we going to see them? More and more people are making less effort to see people in person. Instead many people video chat through cameras on the computer. We need to change this habit. Everybody needs to socialize face to face. If we socialize through computers our socializing skills could worsen because you are not practicing the socializing skills like eye contatct. Instead of talking to people online we could be enjoying with those same people at an amusment park, a restaurant, at a park or simply in our barkyard/house. The world is so beautiful with so many places to see but society is too busy to see it because we're on computer for a long time. Our computers use up so much energy and is a threat to the world, @CAPS2 @CAPS3! Instaed of entertaining ourselves on computer we could be taking hikes, walks on the beach even our street or playing outside in our yard. On a computer you can see a magestic places like beaches but you can't interact with them. If we get off our computer we could be swimming at a beach or a pool! Nature is so beautiful, why ever it? @PERCENT1 of residents in @LOCATION1 own computers and spend a lot of thier day on it. We could be improving obesity, spending more time with family and friends, and exploring Nature! lets make a shange so we can do all of these things!",5,5,1
112,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 these days are telling kids to go outside instead of vegging out in front of a computer. Computers can but promote bad habits. I try not to use the computer unless I have too for school or to get homework. Please consider the negative effects which are exercising in apropprate content and less interaction with friends/family. Yes internets can be used to find diets and exercise plans but if you would just go to the gym to burn of those pounds everything would be just fine! Internet and computers are designed to suck in your brain, and attack you to all the websites and neat little things. It is more effective just to go to a local @ORGANIZATION2 or @ORGANIZATION1 to work out. I swim on a swim team for a @ORGANIZATION2. I love swimming better than going on the computer. It satisfies my personal needs of exercising. I lost @NUM1 pounds by just swimming for a month. I will run on the tred mill to help me burn of stress or anger. Gyms are way better than computers. I know most of us have seen something inapropprate on the computer. Yes computers give people jobs but there is no need to post pictures or messages that will hurt peoples feelings. I know the other day I saw a really mean comment that made me feel bad for the victim. I know youtube is trying to stop inappropriate content, so hurray for them. Once you give something to the internet it is lost forever. Yes computers have ways to keep in touch with friends but it is better to @CAPS3 or visit in person. Like my @CAPS2 always said,"" @CAPS3 more, it builds character!"" @CAPS4 ever I get the chance I @CAPS3 my best buddies instead of using the computer. Kids theses days can be mean with out try. You disconnect yourself from your family. Because computers attrack users, there are times where you don't pay attention to others around you. @PERCENT1 of kids donot do there home work because of computers. Thank you for your time. I think computers are bad and everyone would be happy with out them. They help the obesity level in the nation, let cyber bullying and inappronrate content flow around the internet and lastly block you out from the world. ( @CAPS5.S someday computers are going to take over the world and you will be sorry you didn't listen to me.)",5,4,1
102,"Dear Local Newspaper, Experts should not be concerned about other people that stay on the computer for a while. Maybe people know what they are doing and have to stay on computers for a long time. They also might like to learn things that they never thought about learning. Most people try not to be overweight. Experts should Not try to have less people on the computer. One reason is that people can chat with one another. It can be friends, families, and more. About @PERCENT1 of people chat online with families or friends. Chatting can also help you like if there is an emergency. You can tell someone what is going on and call the cops. Without a doubt chatting online is a great way to use the computer during the time your on it. Another reason is that you can search anything you need to know. Maybe if you have to search something for school, the computer can help you. This can have positive effects on people. It can make someone a better person. You can't agree that getting to search anything is a fantastic way of using a computer for a while. A third reason is that it can teach you hand-eye coordination and gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Learning about things you have never dreamed about learning. There are many people and places in the world that you still have to learn about. Is it surprising to you that almost everyone and anyplace that is famous is on the internet. Using the computer this way is another terrific idea. These are all great ways of using the computer. Being on the for a while is not a waste of time. People can you their time wisly on the computer. Surprisingly it is true that all of the reasons are good for the time being on the computer. So you should try to make people be on the computer less often.",4,4,0
165,"Dear Local Newspaper, everday @CAPS1 technology is developed. One of the biggest and most popular machines in the technocle society is, the computer. Some people don't like computers. The think computers are ruining social skills and healthy bodys. The reason I'm writing to you is to presuade those people to realize the greatness that lies inside a computer. For starters computers help us recive/give @CAPS8. One of the great featurs that computers give is email. Without email, we would be completley out of the loop. For example @CAPS2 there is a snowday at your childs school, you recive an email from the usper intendent saying school si cancled. Without that email, we woulden't be able to know that @CAPS8. Another example, @CAPS6 say that you lost your voice to a terrible cold. You don't feel good and need to call work to report being sick. Now you're stuck because you have no voice. @CAPS2 you had a computer, you could have simply emailed your boss. Another posative tool computers gives us is making communicating esayer. With all of the social networking now avalible like @CAPS4, twitter , @CAPS3 and yahoo messanger. It nearly impossible not to stay in contact with friends and faimly using @CAPS4, you can look up old friends and faimly. Once youve found them, you can friend request them and become online friends. Once youre online friends you can instant message, video chat, look at their status, and browse their photos. So with a computer @CAPS7 nearly impossible not to be able to keep in touch. The last and final reason computers are great is because, they make shopping much esayer. @CAPS2 you have used amazon, ebay or overstock, you know what I'm talking about you can buy almost anything online. From electronics to @CAPS5 animals. The list is endless. With a computer you can even get your house hold groceries online. For example @CAPS6 say your home from work with explosive diharrea. But @CAPS7 @DATE1 so you need to go grociery shopping. You've been on the toilet @PERCENT1 of the day and alls youve got is your laptop. Well you can shop online. So as you can see computers help us communicate, shop and get and recive @CAPS8.",4,5,0
1111,"Being a teen myself, my computer is something I don't think I would be able to live without. But is it holding me back from more important things? I think so. I feel that not having computers will in a way educate people more so than now. For example with school research papers we imediatly go to the computers in order to find information when we could be using books and magazeens. With having the use of computers many people don't properly know how to use and find information in books. Also being around computers and using them so much is pulling families further apart and stopping humans from being more interactive with nature and the environment. For many people using a computer is a life style, it's something we tend to use more than religiously and that @MONTH1 not be the best thing. Children, teens and even adults get extremly addicted to computers. Teens and children use laptops and @CAPS1's everyday in order to do their school work, and to talk with friends. As well as parents/adults, they use it to get their work done and use it as a easy communication with co-workers. To this very day people have become very addicted to computers. I know for certain that in my family, my mother, nor my father, nor my brother, nor I could go through a day without using a computer. As I mentioned before computers are also pulling families further apart. There is less family time and comunication between family members these days, due to computers. Insead of spending time with the family, teens prefer spending time on the computer chatting with their friends. I bet if there was a poll was taken on how much family time has been taken away in households because of computers I almost garentee it would be quite a large amount. I know the only true family time some families have without computers is dinner and that isn't much. Lastly many humans are not as connected to nature and as involved as they used to be. Using computer keeps people inside and not exposed to nature. Though there many advertisements and pop ups on the computer that inform us about how to take care of the earth properly, we so easily ignore them and remain playing on the computer than going outside and doing something to help make the world a better, clearer place. Not only is it just taking care of our earth, but it is also the fact that not many people these days go out and get the fresh air they need as much as they really should. Most likely not all of that is due to the use of computers, but I bet a great deal of it is. Like I said before it is super hard to imagine a day without a computer, I mean how would we communicate or do our work? But there are trulthfully other ways to do them that we just aren't very used to because of the fact that we are so attatched to them. I never really noticed till now that it is possible to live without a computer, and that so many people are missing increadable things such as family and nature because we are so addicted to the computers.",6,5,1
788,"Dear local newspaper, I disagree with the affects that computers have on kids. Computers lets kids do what they want and They dont have to travel far to see certin things. Like if you wanted to see the @LOCATION1's @CAPS1 your not just going to get a plane and fly there when you could get pics and information right on the computer in a couple minutes. Its good if you want to see it in person but you wont want to pay money for plane tikets or travel really far when you can just see it from home. Computers have a lot of fun stuff on them like myspace, @CAPS2, and games also its got almost everything you can think of. So why travel when you can see all of it on your computer. I think that computer can sometimes be a little adictive but you got to learn to stay off of it most of the time but it is very easy to learn stuff on a computer. Computers are used by billions and they a great way to learn stuff about are whole world and the things that are on it. It has information web sites like google or bing to look up anything you want to look up. Computers are almost everywhere in phones, I-pods, and even some are put in car like police cars. Computers are very useful to people of the world @DATE1 I bet that the people who make them will make new ones that can go on almost everything. They have computers in almost every building like hospitials, fire stations, police stations, and electronic stores like radioshack. Your going to learn a lot more on computers than having to travel places and or school. In my mind we should all have computers because there fun and you can learn about everything you could think of so we should all have them. So i think that computers are very useful and can teach you a lot about the things that go on in our world to day so I disagree with what scientist or people say about computers and the affects it has on certin people of @DATE1.",4,4,0
1661,"I remember when computer wernt so popular. Back then I had to write my essays and listen to music on the radio. Now computers are very popular.

You will know that computers are good for our society! Most students use the computers to type college essays, project etc. Which is good because its much easier. For example im a student that can't draw so printed some pictures of the computer so I can paste them on my post board. So in the other words the computer is useful for students. I know @NUM1 out of @NUM2 colleges expect students to turn in there assignements threw the computers or its a zero. In this society theres no time for zeros because when you are in college your still paying for the class even if your failing or not. So basically its a waste of money. So the computer can save us from failing! People these days use computers for pleasure. Usually messaging people on myspace, facebook, twitter, and other social networks. Which is kind of intersting because you can up with friend that you haven't seen in years. As you can see the internet has its advantaes because you would have nvever thought you will see your friend doing. Another thing about computers that you can fint stuff cheaper than everyday lif say if you want to a trip and you call @ORGANIZATION1 for your ticket. The ticket came up to . But you go on the computer and you on @ORGANIZATION1 website and find your ticket to florida the price will most likely be a couple hundred dollars less. Since we are in a restion we will need those couple hundred dollars for savings. Computers are everywhere You can find one at school, home, a cafe or even on your cell phone. Which is good because you can use them at your own convince. At home if my labtop is free I can go on it and be on it for hours playing games. Also, I remember when my computer broke and I wanted to go on the computer so badly. So I realized that I can go on the computer at the library. I was so happy because it was no cost to me. To sum up computers have a positive effect on people. I seriously don't know what to do if I didn't have one because students need them, you can do other things on it, and lastly its easy to acess one! In this generation everybody is rushing and computers.",5,5,1
812,"some people learn about far away places, getting the latest up-dates on important news, and making sloppy work and hand writing seem nice neat. All those thing are some positive benefits people have computers. People all over use computers to research other places computers provide photographs of the place he/she is researching. For example: I remember when I had a social studies project on the @PERSON1, and I had to explain why its a great place to visit for its history. Mind I never even heard on a place called the @PERSON1 @PERSON1, but thanks to computers I googled ""@PERSON1 @PERSON1 @PERSON1"", then the computer gave me all of info. and photos about the mountain @CAPS1. Now I @CAPS2 where and what the @PERSON1 @PERSON1 moutans look like. Secondly, the computers has all the latest news happening all over the world. I remember when the earthquake in haiti first happened my grandmother had it happen until she got on line to check @ORGANIZATION1 and when, where and earthquake on the richter scale. about computers was a I wasn't the best hand writer in class, and could write it out or do it on the computer, plus we were getting graded on neatness, elaboration, and fluency. I choose to do it on the computer it came out nice and neat with picturs. computers has a very positive benefit on people world wide. now matter if its for info, news, or to make thing neates.",4,4,0
1684,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 personal opinion on computer technology is that it is extreamly bad for you, and we need to take percaution, and worry about eye protection vertual harrasment, and that there are dangerouse people on the @CAPS2. Eye protection is important. Although computers are hurting them by, the screen being too bright and hurting your eyes. Also if you look for too long it could make them tierd. I can tell you from personal experence that glasses are un-cool and some people get picked on for it and that could happen if your eyes get hurt so you can see as well as you did befor. It's glasses or even going blind. Vertual harrasment is another thing to be aware of. Over the @CAPS2 you could be cyber bullyed by kids you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not know. For example, one day you could be on @CAPS3 and be talking on a chat room and kids could make sexual, homophobic, or even just plain remakes. Witch brings me to the, sexual harrasment. Sexual harrasment if extreamly can make people feel usually bad selfs. Kids take pride in calling others bad names regarding there rase, there gender, or even the gender they like. So take extra percaution when seeing sexual harrasment. Sexual preditors are a parents biggest fear to kids. Sexual preditors are everyware, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS3, or even your neibors and wile kids are running around town looking and acting the way they do there extreamly un-safe. This is why you @CAPS7 put any personal information on the @CAPS2 not your adress, not your birthday, not your cell or house numbers, nothing not even your town. Also sometimes its a little dangerous to put your last name. So be very carful on the intrenet. When you see sexual harrasment, or someone being followed by a sexual preditor report them! and be safe.",4,4,0
429,"@ORGANIZATION1, Computers are great tools and a great piece of modern technology. Almost every family has them. About @PERCENT1 of my class has computers. So many people have them because their helpful and another current learning resource. Also it's a great way to keep in touch with friends. Although they can be time consuming they make up for it in the long run. First, they are helpful because it's quick an easy to get from page to page. It's especially helpful for work because instead of calling a bunch of clients. You can send them all emails in under a few minutes. They also help with school or planning a vacation. You can find great low prices on travel agencies on the computer. This is great because our country is having a bad acession and we need to be saving every penny. These are some of the few reasons why this modern technology is so helpful. Next is that it's a great current learning resource. You can find articles on anything happening right at that moment or a couple days before. Sometimes the articles in books are old and. Those out dated articles don't have accurate more researched information But, computers do so you can compare your information. Also there are online schoold that are affordable. So if you want to get more of an education but, you have to work too. This helps a great deal. A computer can be used for many things like learning. Computers are definetly the best way to keep in touch with friends and family that you aren't able to see very often. I know what your probably thinking, is that well isn't that what phones are for. No because what if that family member or friend doesn't have a phone. Well then they can use their computer to stay in touch. They can use email, facebook, aim, and so many more. A computer helps me stay in touch with people I haven't seen in awhile. Okay, now that I've stated all my reasons why computers are a great resource. I just want to remind you that their helpful a great learning resource, and a great way to stay in touch. Computers are now an important piece of Society. Computers are a whole new track and it should stay that way.",5,4,1
93,"Readers of ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" should be well informed of the benifets of computers to society. Not only do they teach hand-eye coordination, but they give people the ability to learn about faraway places and provide a means to easy, online communication. In this day and age, good coordination is esencial to prospering in society. Using computers provides a method of both establishing and improving hand-eye coordination from the comfort of your own household or workplace. Dr. @DR1, of @ORGANIZATION1 medical center, says that a recent study shows @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 computers users have better hand-eye coordination than people who do not operate on a computer regularly. In a local primary school, students have begun to ""@CAPS2 to learn"", a program that promotes quick typing. School officials have seen a dramatic increase in the typing speed of children since the program was started in @DATE1. In this way, the computer provides a secure route to better hand-eye coordination. Even more importantly, the hand-eye coordination gained from using a computer can increase the chances of getting a job involving computer hand-eye coordination as an adult such as the position of a secretary or grafic designer. While hand-eye coordination is a factor of computers that has an extremely positive effect on people, the ability to learn about distant places with the touch of a keyboard is even more benificial towards all users. Website such as google and yahoo can track down millions of results in a matter of seconds if you search the name of a city or country. This can be handy when working on school projects as well; instead of having to lug tens of books home to finish an essay on @LOCATION1, you can simply look up the information on a computer at your house. When summertime comes around, and the last school bell rings, you can instead research faraway places that could turn into vacation spots instead of homework assignments. All of the travel information from plane tickets to the right currency is at your fingertips on a computer. If ""@LOCATION2 @CAPS1"" readers were aware of this, lots of trouble would be prevented and lots of time would be saved. The one component of computers that is used even more than research is online communication. State officials, governers, and even the president can post messages on websites for citizens to view while they check the weather or their email. This is a much easier way to hear goverment statements than waiting through endless commercials to hear speeches on the @CAPS4. Social networking sites are also immensly popular, and on pages like facebook and twitter you can reconnect with people who you don't have the chance to see everyday, or don't lie relative vincinity. If your cousin is going to school abroad, and did not have access to an international phone, you could communicate with them through email on the computer, and it would be as if they never left. It is ridiculous to think that someone could find computers - the gateway to faraway places, good hand-eye coordination, and the connection ten distant friends and family - a concern to society. They help town in countless ways and ""@CAPS5 @CAPS1"" readers should be aware of this.",5,6,1
1310,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am writing to you about how technology affects people. My argument is that some people think that Computers are taking to much of people time, I will tell you how technology keeps people from excersizeing and gaining life expieriences. Now I will explain in further details. My first reason for sayi-ng computers affect people is that they cant get excersize when there face is glued to a computer screen all day. And especially with the amount of kids palying video games or playing on the computer, the childhood obeasity rate will slowly rise due to them not getting excersize or they will just get very weak. That is why computers have a negative affect on people by not letting them get the excersize they need. My seconed reason for saying computers have a negative affect on people is that they won't be able to gain life experience I say this because when something asks you ""@CAPS3, what did you do today?"" youre only answer could be ""@CAPS4, can we chande the question to what did I not do today?"" @CAPS5 when your on the computer all day you wont be able to explore and obseve nature well maybe you could do that on a @CAPS6 server but it isnt the same. And even when parent ask if you want to go for a walk you should do it, You could learn somthing or see somthing you wouldn't be able to see on a daily basis. That is why computers have a negative affect on people when their face is glued to a computer. So now I am going to close this letter and I hope you see that excersize and gaining life experiences will change your life forever.",4,3,0
1384,"Dear @CAPS1, In my own opinion, computers do not have a positive effect on people. Online, you can go on any website and talk to people. Most of the time, you @MONTH1 not even know who it is your speaking with. Plus not all information you @MONTH1 find is true. Computers also take time away from doing something productive, like playing outside. In the next few pragraphs, I'll show you my point. First off, online websites have many different ways to contact people (chat rooms, blogs, email etc.) @CAPS2, do you really know if the people you're talking to are who they say they are? Back then, it was rare someone got caught when trying to kidnap a child by pretending to be someone online; @CAPS3 a days more and more people are getting caught. You @MONTH1 think this won't happen to your child, but my friend was being stalked online by someone what they haven't caught. We never thought something like that would happen, @CAPS2 it did. Also, once it's online it never goes away. So watch what you put online, there is always some way to find what you had posted even once deleted. Plus not every bit of information found online is ture. I professionals say that @PERCENT1 of kids have researched a project online then used a print source and found that information to be false. On websites like wikipedia any one has the ability to change what is written on the page. Most websites @PERCENT2 give the ability for anyone to do so. Also post and pictures on the internet @MONTH1 not always be appropriate. There's certain criteria we keep children from seeing for a reson. Lastly, computers keep you from doing anything productive. It @MONTH1 teach hand-eye coordination however it does not keep you fit and healthy. Already, @PERCENT3 of @CAPS4 alone are over weight and that's alot of people. Dr. @DR1 says that online games keep kids from getting much needed exsersize and fresh air, that every growing child needs. In conclusion the internet keeps children from going outside to play. Also, not everything found is what is true or right. Lastly, not everyone you find is the person they portray themselves. This is why I think that comperters aren't positive in society.",5,5,1
766,"Dear @CAPS1, Have you ever used a computer to do anything besides buisness? Well if not then when you are not busy you should try it. The effects computers have on people is that it's a lot of fun to go on and play, helpful with mostly anything, and you can find just about anything from websites on clothing to maps to the store location. There are three reasons why you should agree with me and these reasons are people have the right to choose what they want to, in this weather it's a little bit to cold to go out and enjoy nature, lastly they can interact with friends and familys online on a website. People have the right to choose what they do because the goverment can't choose for you since they're busy with other more important stuff. Also in the constitution it states that the goverment can't choose for us while we have the power to think. In this weather it's cold to go out, plus nature is so much better in the @DATE1 and the @DATE2 where it's not to hot to cold and thats when the sun is good thats when people should enjoy nature. With all the technology in todays world it's better to take advantage of the technology in this world, also the technology we have is helping people like generators because in old times people didn't have generators. So I hope this letter has changed your opinion and thank you for reading it.",4,4,0
668,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand the conterversies between having computers. Computers are the center of technology. I can't imagine a world without them. Though having a computer @MONTH1 cause children to play uneducational games, computers teach more and help children as well. I know for your company, having no computer would be a nightmare. It gives education to not only children, but adults as well. First of all, computers are proven to be the second best source of education, behind school, along with the best source of information. Millions of websites are specified to only education of all kinds. Not only are there websites. these are @CAPS1's with online tutors or just work. Computers provide practically anthing you need. For work, adult use. computers to sell something communicate with someone or just look up a new topic. The technology of a computer is farther than any other item. Without a computer life would be much more difficult. Instend of just sending an email, mail would have to be sent out. Most information would have to from brooks. In fact even the internet has books to buy and read. I am aware that people feel that children are spending too much time on the computer talking to friends, but children need to be social, @CAPS2 it weren't talking on the computer, there would just be more texting and calling. The computer makes life so much easier that to take it away would cause stress and less time for other important activities. Lastly. computers have documents and it is the best way to type. Your company can definetly agree that without typing documents life would be a mess. Everyone writes up documents and needs to send them, open them up again, and edit them. The only other access to typing is a type writer. Types writers can't save anything, delete and do half the work computers do. Your whole job depends on the computer and typing. How would you feel @CAPS2 you couldn't use a computer. In conclusion, computers are a necessity to our living. Without computers life would be difficult and stressful. Computers give education stand information to everyone. The technology is unbelievable and makes everyday life, easier. I couldn't even imagire no documents and typing. I'm sure you will agree with my decision. I hope you chose to inform others with this information. Thank you for your time",5,5,1
627,"Dear local newspaper @CAPS1, I do agree that exercising,. I think that people exercising more, and spend time with family and friends. The issue to with is should more people sometime on their less time, exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends should it be the other way around. The first reason why I think that people should spend more time exercising than on their computers is because I think that more to watch and watch the way they eat and keep that self fit because what responsible to see their kid eat and then out exercising and then then self. My second reason is I think that people should time enjoying nature then computer The reason I think this id because they would never would never know what going on computer. How can you never things do. My third reason is interacting with friends and family I think that people should friends and family then on the computer because interacting with friends and family you learn things that you never knew about then and you can places you never gonna be sure discover new things you never your life. For example over vacation I did things and things about my family and friends than I never know why because I people interacting I learned how fun they really are and intering and happy. Have fun where is the computer. Please don't your life live your life. It's now or never should 'people spend more time on or more time exercising. interacting with family and friends.",4,4,0
398,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 look at advances in technology over the years and can tell what an influence it has had on current day and people. The question is, are these advances for the better? Or will they take a turn for the worst? Today i will be talking to you about technology, and why i think its benefitting society poorly. With people spending less time excercising and enjoying nature, leaving ther social life behind by constanly being on the computer, they dont realize how much they're hurting themselves. The number of obese people especially in children, increases each day. This is caused by lack of excersize because some people are too busy responding to texts, talking on the phone and playing unneeded video games. Not only are they physically harming themselves, but they are definitley missing out on the wonderful aspects of mother nature! Why not get out for a little, escape the technology prison cell you've all been reeled into. The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the most beautifuly countries in the world, take advantage that! Now, without proper excersize, your putting you heart at serious risks. Even doing smaller things, like jumping jacks or cuntups, can help make you and you heart healthy! Your parents, and even your parents parents, are who brought you into this world, faught for you in times of need, and would do anything to protect you. What would you say if i told you technology was pushing them away? Texting at the dinner table while they are trying to make conversation, never leaving you room because you playing ""fun"" games, hiding behind he face of technology all the things a vast number of people do instead of socializaing with the people who matter most: family and friends. Although your friends @MONTH1 be more easy going they still came that your too busy hanging out with you computer to come meet up with them @CAPS3 single person can live without a friend and that friend needs you! Make some time for the people who have a special place in you heart before they disapper. To sum it up, techology is corrupting the minds of human beings... and it need to stop! like i said be healthy and happy and spend enough time with the people you are about who knows, maybe they an make you happier than your electric companion. So, fellow citizens, leap off that desk chair, shut off your electronic devices, and jump back into the real world.",5,5,1
680,"Dear @CAPS1 man, @CAPS2 would you want people to be on a computer all day doing nothing? How would you feel if no one was out getting excrise, and no one was using the playgrounds, parks and beachs. Everyone will be sitting at home on there nice new fanny computers. When you really do think about how much time people spend doing nothing, just sitting around, @CAPS2 would a computer solve that problem? It really @CAPS4't. This is what I would say to having computers, People spend to much time on computers, excrise is needed, everyday, and it makes your body wear and your eyes strained. When it comes to computers everyone wants to get one, but when we say excrise it seems like peoples mind click off. This happens because people are really starting to spend lots of time on computers. If they work on computers during a long period of the day, @CAPS5 head home to spend more time on the computer, @CAPS5 whats that doing to your body? not helping it. I like computers to and I like spending time on them, when i need to get something done sometime that doesn't happen, because I get and I forget what time it is and that's not fun. Sometime this happens to people they are engaged in there computer, when someone is talking to them and your telling them something you need them to do, and there noding there head like they know what you sayed, but the next time you asked if it got done and it didn't, you know they were listening. Excrise is really important for your body and doens't even have to be to got anything, but don't spend your time wasted on computers. This happens to @NUM1 to @NUM2 or families when they come home from work or school, and jump right on the computers, families are not getting enough excrise or spending time with family because computers get in the way of that. Excrise would help to keep you instead of electronics. Computers are like little robots that control your mind and body, it sucks the life cut of you. It strains your eyes it makes you wrat and you really dont want to do a lot, maybe if people spend less time on computers and more time being more focused on families and nature, they @CAPS4't be weak and tired. I know a lot of people who @CAPS4't want computers to be banned, but I think it would help for a lot of reasons and make families closer and bodys more focused, from my experience computers do help in some ways, but when it comes to real life it helps for really no one. i hope you understand @CAPS2 I say these sort of things, but if you do care about health and activities @CAPS5 you would say that computers are not a lot of help also.",5,4,1
928,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people believe that the negatives of computers out weigh the positives. I believe that computers help as much more than hurt. There are a few minor instances where computers have hurt people, but @CAPS2 more instances where they have helped @CAPS2 people. There are some cases that a victim of an accident recovers with the help of computers. Likewise there are other times that close family or friends can talk to each other over the @CAPS3. Also, people could learn about amazing places. Thus computers are very vital to us. Computers are vital to us because they help our reflexes. In my experience as a computer engineer. I have learned that playing or using a computer call help victims of reflex damaging accidents. A computer helps the victim by giving them a better feel on their environment. The victem could see exactaly what he is doing and so could his and doctors. Like wise to the physical treatment, computers an relief. Thus the patient gets stronger physically and mentaly. Thus, computers help a humans life be enchacing their reflexes. Likewise to help our reflexes, computers with the @CAPS3 would help people that are distance apart could connect. One of the ways people very far away connect is with soldiers and their families. Back in my military days, nothing helped better than talking. The easiest way of this was talking over. It gave me a gigantic. Thus computers are vital to as humans. Likewise, computers help us see places that are amazing. For example, when a @NUM1 year-old boy visits a website that talks about the wonders of the @LOCATION1 rain forest. He then tells his science class, who the spread the word of preservation of the forest. The boy then grows up to be an explorer of the @LOCATION1, finding new speceses. All this would happen because he was on a computers. Computers help us see the unseen. In the end, computers are great if used in regulation. They help victims heal, soldiers connect and inspire the youth, Computers are vital source of knowledge and advancement for humans.",5,5,1
365,"Can you imagine a world full of lifeless zombies obsessing over technology such as computers, television, and cellular phones? Our world as we know it will come to an abrubt end if we don't stop this nonsense. Computers can cause obesity, a lack of interactment, and they waste their time on these useless items. Our world can't set aside time for such. Our planet is run by us humans and if we don't take care for its necessities, we will all die including our beloved planet @LOCATION1. Computers aren't a benefit to our society today. First off, computers can cause major obesity like it has done already. Obesity is one of the most brought up health problems in the world. Many issues cause obesity but technology (computers) take a big role in it. Instead of sitting on a computer all day, they can do something a lot more productive such as taking a walk starting a club (adult once children!), help out neighbors ect. So what if they teach hand eye cordination they don't teach us how to stay fit! Computers play a big role in the obesity factor. As adults, you should know how much obesity matters. Children are the future nobody would want the future leaders to be known for the widespread obesity. Never theless, computers take away ""bonding"" time from family and friends. Adults and children alike are lacking social needs. They don't verbally and physically interact ith their ""online friends"". And they wonder why families these days are turning out the way they are the source of the cause is computers. Anyways, people spend too much time on computers if people didn't waste so much time on computers they wouldn't be losing jobs like dropping flies. The unemployment rate is high because they suppose they ""don't have enough time"". When all their time is devoted to To computers if they took out the computers in their lives, they would have @CAPS1 of time to do such. No one wants a ""stay at home"" unemployed loser as themselves. In the end, computers are not a benefit to our poorly run society. They cause obesity, corrupt social needs and eat the people's time away, you @MONTH1 think computers allow others to ""chat"" online with their ""online friends"" but they don't provide our physical and verbal social needs which results in a low self esteem.

524,"@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people are using computers more often. Some people do not agree that computers are good. I think computers are good though. They help you learn more, they are like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and when you bored you can go on the internet. People nowadays are becoming smarter and smarter. One of the causes is the internet. The internet is like a big book. It holds tons of great information. There's probly information on the internet that probly no one knows, until they read it. Plus the fact that the internet is quick & easy. Also, the internet keeps you up to date on things going on in the world. Without the internet. We would be nowhere. Surveys show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the internet for information or projects for school. Also, on the internet you can buy things you can't but in stores. Going to the library is a pain. You have to pay for the gas plus you have to drag yourself out of the house to get in the car to go to the library. What if you don't have a library near you? then what will you do? you could go on the internet. Plus, with @CAPS2, people could look for a book all day, not find it and find out that someone else has it. What a pain. There are some people like collage people, Who don't have cars. So how the sapposed to get to the library? Studies show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 don't have cars. When you get bored, what do you do? eat? sleep? Lay on the floor staring at the celing? No. You go on the computer. The internet has all sorts of fun games and websites. It also helps you make new friends. The internet is also a good way to stay in contact with close friend or relative. Also, if you are a photographer, then you can sell & share you photographs online you can also advertise you company or buisness. @NUM3 out @NUM4 @CAPS3 either have no backyard or have nothing better to do.

1038,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a world without computers. I picture it as a better place. Why wouldn't you want to make the world better. Computers @MONTH1 be helpful for work and business but young children are losing time to exercise, enjoy nature, and interact with family and friends. What do you prefer having computers or no? In my opinion people would be better off without them. Lack of exercise is brought up countless times in society. Computers is one factor to blame with the @LOCATION1 already being one of the most obese countries in the world who would want to add on to this cotastrofy. If the number of computers used in each household increase the amount of obese people in @LOCATION2 will as well. If computers take away exercise than health issues will more often and at a younger age. Dr. @PERSON1 says ""if kids are spending more of their free time on the computer rather than increasing the risk of diabetes will increase for them"" @CAPS3 it also a possible result in less exercise. Older citizens will be a big target for a heart attack. It is said that five out of six people could have stopped a heart attack just from taking same time out of their day to go to the gym or take a walk. No one should lose exercise over playing virtual games and instant messaging on the internet. Less people get a chance to enjoy nature when they are on the computer all day. If more people cared for nature then global warming would not be an issue. In my opinion the citizens of @LOCATION2 would want to keep it more clean and be more about their. more people cared about nature and enjoyed it wildlife would be taken away from animals. People would put an end to what some people and companies are doing to nature. Lastly when your on your computer all day you don't realize what nature has to offer fresh air and animals. Or endless canyons needs to enjoy nature more, computer should not be in their way. Wouldn't most people that their relationships with family members and friends could be a lot stronger if they interacted and spent time with them instead of with their computer. @CAPS2 how much a dinner conversation and family party could improve if people were closer with their family. Plus people need family. Your computer can't get you through the emotional pain if losing a loved one. @PERCENT1 of people can get through difficult and stressful times with family. Last but not least your social life could improve if people werent on the computer all day. Not interacting with people could turn you antisocial and not fun to be around. No one wants to be that way. Also your computer might not be working all the time, but your family and friends always will be there. The world would be better off without computers. I think everyone that sits in their room on the computer could change their exercise, enjoy for nature, also family and friend relationships by getting off it and do things that they will actually benifit from. There is no need for a computer in your life, but don't speak for everyone. The question then is do we stop using computers or do we turn them off for good.",6,5,1
1375,"New @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 computers is a benefit to society. Most people not think so but there are many reasons why they are. People will always have something to do when they are bored, there is plenty to learn, and it keeps you organized. After reading this paper, you will agree with me that computers are a benefit. Do you ever get bored and have nothing to do ? Well if you have a computer around, there are endless things to keep you busy. People can talk to their friends and keep in teach with them. No matter how far away they go. There are many websites that have games you can play. Any type of game they are all on the computer. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" I might get addicted to a game and never want to take my eys off the screen. Well, in that case, you can always set a timer on it to give you a certain amount of time, but don't worry, it warns you before it shuts down on you. The computer isnt' all fun and games though. It is filled with knowledge, it's like the brain of @NUM1 scientists and mathematicans put together. If you have a school assignment in write a paper on someone famous, you can research them on the computer for a quick way to get information. There will be plety of websites about that person. Also, everyday there are news updates about what is going on in the world. You never have to worry about not knowing whats going on. Do you like to stay organizes I personally, think it's easier to get through life and everyday, knowing where things are and staying organized. The computer is a great, easy way to keep organized. There are many programs that you can use to write documents, make graphs and whatever you need to do. About <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of working people need the computer to do their job and keep track of everything. @PERCENT1 of the working humans is a larger amount. So, thing about it, if computers weren't made, that <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people would not have, jobs, or they would have to keep everything down on paper which @MONTH1 be a catastrophe. After a while, you @MONTH1 want to back everything up by copying all of your photos, files, music ect. to a @CAPS4 so you dont loose everything if your computer shuts down. After reading this, don't you agree with me, that computers are a benefit to society? There are many more reasons but this paper had alot. I hope you have realized that without computers, the world wouldn't be as it is today. Thank you for your time. ",5,5,1
1007,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers these days have made positive changes to all of our every day lives. People have made beter connections with family and friends, and even have the ability to make new ones. While social networks are great and all, computers can also make work extremely easy and proffesional-looking. They can also perfect the skill of hand-eye coordination. But with that in mind, is the computer truly a harmful or helpful device? Sometimes we wonder where our long lost friends and relatives have gone and how they are. Well, with the computer and internet access, you can easily contact them through great social networks such as @CAPS1. I hear it all the time from everyone that reunions have been made, and friends have been reunited. And reuniting friends, you can also make new ones with a simple click of a button. Isn't making more friends and reconnecting so easy now? Computers nowadays offer wonderful software from @ORGANIZATION2 that can make making slideshows, projects, and reports far easier. I remember making a @CAPS2 with my best friend back when we were in @NUM1 grade. All we did was take the pictures, upload them to his laptop, and then we added captions to all of the pictures. We did an amazing, professional job on the project and received an A-. Though I understand that in the process of computer-usage, people hardly find time outdoors, the technological advance will enhance hand-eye coordination. Imagine this: You're up at bat in a baseball game. @NUM2 strikes and @NUM3 balls is your count. Everyone is cheering you on. The pitcher pitches the ball and wham! You swing that bat and hit yourself a homerun! Do you know what skill was used to hit that ball? That's right - hand-eye coordination. So now while everyone is wondering what sort of effect the computer has, remember how easy that work was for me. Also think back to that baseball player. You know, the one that hit the homerun using hand-eye coordination. But most importantly remember how easy it would be to contact the ones you love most and keep closest to you. The computer is a positive advance in society, and everyone should be assured so!",5,5,1

A computer to give the quier accesible information is do there project at home. Computers are great ways to meet people online so that you stay social and not. They also teach hand-eye-cordination. So you eyes are beter their seeing nothing. I also think computer benifits society because it could get student motivated in passing there test or passing the school year and getting the to use it. Computers are also a great of knowledge and can get kids to be better on a subject like history, or science, you should agree with me because local @ORGANIZATION1 papers got there information off the internet sometimes and with our computers @ORGANIZATION1 would be slow and. Computers also have positive effects on people because it teaches them the dangers of things and they could be more and, and computers give finger strongly gripto be a lot faster, and computers are the fastes way to know about the @ORGANIZATION1 or about the wether, like if there wits going to be a snow storm you could check if you got school.",3,4,0

This would be bad for all children. All these reasons will lead to the @NUM2 below. Secondly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it couses voilence, because @DATE1 the reasons started in the @NUM3 paragraph, if all this continues, then it @MONTH1 & lead to voilence, in @DATE1 @NUM4 people died from all the crimes online. @NUM5 threats were found online from big websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2 & @CAPS3. Lastly, I am concerned that people spend too much time on the computer because it could lead to illegal crimes, In @DATE3 a girl was talking to a boy online then when they decided to meet, he shot & killed her. It turned out he was just a person who lied about who he was online, @CAPS4 on a website online, a group @DATE1 men were talking about now much they hated kids so they decided to shot them @ their bus stops. Thank god that the police caught them before they were to do the crime In conclusion, I am concenred that people are spending too much time on the computer because it causes trouble, voilence, & illegal crimes.

194,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you want our society to becaome one of obese, lazy with no appreciation for family or friends? @CAPS2 you want people to lock a respect for nature? This is the result of excessive of computer usage our society will become lazy, and dependent upon robot slaves and loose, brain washed. People will not be caring for family or friends. Most importantly, our society will have no appreciacion or respect for mother nature. Is this the way you wish our world to be? Have you ever read @CAPS3 @NUM1? In the book, the government uses technology to brainwash people and then manipulate them. If our society, like the one in the book, becomes over dependent on computers and technology, then we will collapse from the inside going from a respected world power, to a third world country in. We will need to redesign buildings to have doors big enough for our bodies to fit through. We will not be a respected nation anymore. There will be charities in other countries to send money to build gyms and pools, but nobody will use they. Recent research from @ORGANIZATION1 says that @PERCENT1 of people who spend more than an hour and a half on their computer every day are over @NUM2 pounds. People won't remember how to talk. Babies will learn to type instead of talking or walking. Is this good for our country? People say that the best thing you could ever have is a supportive family and a group of good friends. According to @PERSON1, a well known psychologist, ""People who have more friends have a @PERCENT2 reduced risk of depression."" Friends actually affect you health. People who use the computer too much lose friends and became separated from their families. The mental health effects from this can be horrible, and people sadly will miss out on all the positive parts of life. It's important that people are happy, but if you onlr communicate through e-mail and social networking sites, you aren't social enbough. It is one thing to chat online, but it is better to be able to see someone face to face than a picture on screen. Nobody wants to end up like this, so limit oyur computer usage. With too much computer usage comes a lack of respect for nature, People used to care nature for many reasons, but the biggest is that it affects us everyday, in everything we @CAPS2 and own. Everything has a base in nature, even ourselves. The weather outside even on a beautiful @DATE1 day, can be deadly if we don't pay attention to what is going on outside of our safe house. We depend on nature but if we don't respect her, she will kill us. Anything is good in moderation, even a computer. But when we don't limit ourselves, it has bad consequences. We will no longer have a respected society. Our family and friends will dissapear, causing health problems. Worst of all, we will lose all expectation and respect for mother nature. The time to start limiting computer usage is now, or we will have many great problems.",5,5,1

Are there some relatives you been face to face with @CAPS5 its because of computers. Computers @CAPS3 let us things like video chat with relatives for or go on facebook and myspace or @CAPS5 @CAPS6 to chat with them or email. The problem with this is being lazy.

350,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you imagine a world without computers? Well I @CAPS1't because I think computers are great. First of all if you have a computer you @CAPS1 meet new people. Second you @CAPS1 do projects on them or homework if you need to. Lastly in a computer you @CAPS1 basically find out anything you want to know. Read ahead and discover why I think computers are great. Who doesn't like meeting new people, because I do. If you wanted to get new friends or find anyone who go to your school and you might not now you @CAPS1 look them up on your computer. Also if you had nobody to talk to one time you @CAPS1 go on the computer and try to meet new people. I know I do that all the time. Lastly it doesn't hurt anymore to make friends or talk to people online. it's actually fun once you try it. So that's why I think one reason that computers are great is because of the people you meet. Second reason why computers are great is because if you have to print something or make a project a computer @CAPS1 help. My science teacher always wants assignments printed and how @CAPS1 I do that with out a computer. Also if one day you forgot your homwork or any assignments just ask a friend online of if you have a school website look on it. Therefore computers are great because all assignments look ,better when they are printed. My last reason is because on a computer you @CAPS1 pretty much look for anything. For example, say you wanted to find a place to go to and you didn't have a adress or anything, you @CAPS1 always check on the computer. Also if their is a problem or something with you house, car, bills, or anything you @CAPS1 always see if you @CAPS1 get any hekp on internet. Lastly if you wanted to buy anything and you could't find it any stare you @CAPS1 just get it online. So basically like I said you @CAPS1 do anything. In conclusion I think omputers have a great effect on life. First you @CAPS1 meet how people or friends. Second you @CAPS1 do projects or homework. Lastly you @CAPS1 basically do anything on a computer. So that's why I think computers are great and they @CAPS1 help alot in life instead of hurting anyone.",4,4,0
471,I believe that computers benefit society. They make life easier. Computers allow now of communication between friends. They also teach you new things. Computers make our lives easier. They let us look things up by easier means than a person or book. It has made it simpler to type reports. Now you don't have to worry about making mistakes on a typewriters and having to type it again. A computer saves the report and shows you some mistakes to take case of your children. It allows you to from your home. Computers allow new means of communication. You can talk online with friends. Social networks such as @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 allow that. Computers allow you to converse with friends you don't normally get to see or talk to. They also make it easier and more fun to make new friends. Computers teach us new things. They teach you about places you haven't seen before. Any question you can be asked on the internet and you will get an answer. It gives you answer you don't know who to ask for. Computers also teach hand-eye coordination. You can play games online or with @CAPS3's. You need to have good hand-eye coordination in order to play these games. Computers have a positive effect on people of all ages. They make our lives easier with their technology. They allow us to communicate with our friends through social networks. Computers also teach us new things such as hand-eye coordination. All these reasons and more are why I believe that computers benefit our society.,4,4,0
207,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 a computer isn't harmful in any way. It helps people learn about things they didn't know. Also it lets people interact with people around the world. Another is that it lets people stay in touch with family and friends around the globe. Computers don't harm, they help. Computers are a learning tool. Schools like mine have over a hundred computers but they are only used for education. Anyway even if we try to go on different sites we get redirected to a blocked website. Cars and other machines were built by computers which supplied the blueprints. There is one thing computers are mostly used for, and thats to learn. Are you thinking about going on vacation somewhere but don't know how things work around there? Well a computer can help you with those promblems. It lets you see how people are and what the place looks like with a virtual tour. Even with some assistance if you don't know about traditions or beliefs. Computers are a great way to explore. Computers are a great way to communicate with others. Family members that live on the otherside of the world can use computers to talk and see how your doing. How about old friends that moved away. You can still talk and communicate with each other. Getting in touch with friends and family isn't all that bad is it? And these are reason to show how computers aren't harmful in anyway. It gives people a good education. It lets people learn about cultures of places around the world. And talking to friends is something thats good, not bad. This is why computers don't harm people, they help.",4,4,0
851,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 studies have been conducted over the past few years, and they show that people of all ages spend @PERCENT1 of their free time on the computers. This is becoming a problem all over our state and country. Computers are consuming the lives of everyone. An anonymous source claims that they use their computer to contact old friends. A study shows that phone usage has gone down because adults and teens would prefer to email or instant message a friend. This results in sitting in front of a computer screen waiting for a responce. @PERSON1, a student at @ORGANIZATION2 says, I go on the computer once or twice a week. i dont use it all that much because I'd rather be out having fun with all my friends rather than be holed up in a room by myself."" @CAPS2 people believe it is a way to be more social, but it really isn't. It's just sitting in front of a screen talking to people you @MONTH1 not even know too well. When you sit down in your computer chair and start e-mailing away, you aren't doing any physical exercise. The @CAPS2 movement people will normally do is get up and go to the bathroom. Then they are right back in a chair, making minimal movements. @PERCENT2 of people who sit in front of a computer end up obese because they don't burn any calories. Since they don't relesase many endorphins, so they aren't very happy. If they got up and went outdoors to do physical exercise, they would be fit and happy . Often, teenagers feel more powerful when they are using a computer. They find it easier to disobey rules their parents set for them. Teens also find it easier to bully other children via the internet or social networks. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION2 middle @ORGANIZATION2 confess to being the target of malicious bullying online. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 confess to be bullied, and they definitely don't want to be bullied on facebook or myspace where everything is out on your profile for your peers to see. Teens should have limited time on the computer, so they don't do anything they will regret in their future. Therefore, adults and teens should be aware that using a computer is fine, but they shouldn't over use the luxury of a way to find information quickly or contact a friend in a foreign country. This generation needs to be reminded that their whole life shouldn't be spent on the computer. Probably less than @NUM5 minutes a day should be spent checking your e-mail or instant messaging a friend. Then you should go outdoors and spend time with your friends and family.""",5,4,1
749,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever forgot the book you needed for homework? Did you ever miss the newest episode of your favorite show? Well, all these things and more can be solved by using the computer. The computer gives us all the things we need. Whether that's information, games, or online friend chatting websites. The computer is necessary for our society today. Countless times I was in desperate need for information. If I'm doing a school report on animals. I can just go on the computer and search whatever I want. There's no more need for driving to the town library and then searching through countless books and encyclopedias. I just think that that is a waste of time, when you basically have everything you need twenty foot away. And it's in your house! There is no more need to search for hours through biographies. If you need to know state capitals, you can find it in no time. To me, that's a life saver. Not only can computers help you with information, it can make school projects so much easier. In my own experiences, I've needed pictures on school projects. Instead of drawing it, the internet can save time and effort. All you need to do is print out the pictures! However, if you have an essay that's, let's say, supposed to be ten pages who wants to write all that? With a computer, you can type it out in half the time. Then, when done, you can print it, or even send it straight to your teacher. But, if it's not finished, you can save it on a thumbdrive, and use it on any computer you want. All in all, that's a huge help. My final reason why computers are good, is that they serve instant pleasure. Computers have millions of games that a kid can play for free. Also, it has many website, like @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, that let you interact with friends. If you need to tell them something, there is no need for a phone. Plus, if you miss certain shows, or want to watch music videos, there are websites for that. As a kid, I'm usually never home because of sports and school activites. If I miss something on @LOCATION1, it is almost definitely going to be on the computer. You don't have to wait a week or so before they replay that episode. Who wants to do that? In the end, I think computers benefit people around the world. No more driving to libraries, or going out and buying games. The computer has everything you want for free. Basically, I think the computer is a huge time and effort saver that every household needs. It definitely benefits society.",5,5,1

America is becoming obese and not getting any real useful information out of the computer. Some people are just sitting, mind lessly infront of their computer and eating at the same time! That makes things worse as not only are they not getting exercise, but now they are gaining weight as well as not losing any. This is the exact opposite of what a human should be doing. True people exercise every day. Being on the computer is not a bad thing, sometimes. Sometimes you need to find something about nature but wouldn't it be easier to go outside and find new think I dont live by the but you can to one all the woods cannot be just gone.

I recently heard that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, and enjoying nature. I dont think that they should be concerned because the computer leave's people with an open mind and teach people new thing. So the computer does a lot for people, give's them the chance to learn new thing, a chance to chat with friends far away, and also expand your mind of travel. Computers can do a lot for a person's life of know'lleage. Just yesterday I found out that the human body can not survive without its liver. The computer also helped me with my strugle's in math, even though that's what the teacher is for she is not always their, like when I am home or away on vacation and I just want to remember so thing's in math. Its also help's people who want to know new launage's such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @CAPS4. So you see a computer has a big affect on a person's life. Two days ago I did a video chat with my grandparents back in @LOCATION2 it was great. After six year's not seeing my grandparents they really changed, and I was starting to forget what they looked like. I never knew that a computer could do a video chat from so far away I was surprised. I dont know why you experts are so concerned about computer taking away people's live's look what it has done for my family. I know that if one of you experts family member went away for a long time you would miss them and want to talk. Some people's love to video chat like people in the army because they get the chance to see their love one's. A two-way ticket to @LOCATION3, To see all those beautiful sight's and taste their wonderful food's look at that waterfall where is that, In @LOCATION4, @LOCATION1 now I have to go their. The computer has shone me places that I have neve sene before. The computer is a wonderful thing. So dont be concerned about us and what we do on the computer. In conclusion dont listen to the experts they dont know what their talking about, for all we know they use the computer more than we do.

But computers cannot simulate fresh air and exercise. Computers allow people to play a wide variety of games. People can play chess, solatire, and a great deal other games like that. Computers also allow us to play a very wide variaty of online games. I can think of at least three different sites that have online games. Each site having at least @NUM1 different games! Hundreds of thousands of people play online games everyday! What would they do if we didn't have the computer to play those games? We can also search any topic from a computer anywhere. This is a amazing thing to be able to do. Imagine if nobody had a computer how would we research so much of our knowledge? Yes there are but using a computer is so much more faster. Plus you can print thing out on a computer with a book you have to copy important down. But you can highlight the important. How much could ? No matter how much computer do they @MONTH1 be but it is kids getting bigger and bigger all because they long. Computers are amazing and society benefits from them by a lot.

1239,"Dear editor of @LOCATION2 @CAPS1, @LOCATION3's society is being ruined, ruined by computers of course. They are so time consuming that I am afraid they are causing more people to be obease in @LOCATION3. People are afraid that they are limiting themselves from interacting @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, and spending time enjoying nature. I feel the exact same way and someone should put a stop to this! An average american goes on a computer for about @NUM1 hours a day. With going to work or school, and sleeping, that way leaves a litle @NUM2 to go out and explore nature. Our national parks @NUM3's have been decreasing in their numbers of customers at a fast rate. I visited yellow stone last week to find out if as many people have been goind. The man who works at the entrance was saying that ""since the start of @DATE1 alone about @PERCENT1 less people have been to @LOCATION1,"" I believe that the reason for that is because of computers. They limit people from goind to parks or to zoo's, by consuming the public time with all of the ""new fashion"" or the newest game on miniclip.com. Also, I believe that the public is spending so much time on computers that they are not able to go out and exersize. With the newest ""sims game,"" how are kick supposed to stay fit and healthy? I did a study on how many hour kids spend on thier computer and out of the people who said more than @NUM4 minutes. @PERCENT2 of them could legally considered obease. Is that now we want our next gerneration to be out next president and lawyers, and doctors? @CAPS8, we want them to live life to the @CAPS4 by taking care of themselves by exersizing. Computers are getting kids so consumed that is not ok. Lastly, with computers, families and friends don't really talk to each another @CAPS2 to @CAPS2, or interact with each other at all i mean sure, parents come home to thier child on the computer and give them a kiss on the head. But is that enough? I do not believe it is. I asked a friend of mine's child about how much he interacts with his family and friends? @CAPS2 to @CAPS2 he said that well since he got his new ""@CAPS5 @CAPS6 with a @NUM5 gig hardrive"", he hadn't been talking to them a whole @CAPS2 to @CAPS2. However, everyday we went on ""chat"" ""for a good @NUM6 hours"", to talk to his friends. And only occasionally would he get an @CAPS7-mail or two from his asking how his days was. I do not believe that that is good in order to have good friends and a strong family life. That is what @LOCATION3 has come down to computers. They limit you from interacting to friends and family, give you less time to exersize and limit you from going out and exploring nature. Who knows, maybe at this time in @NUM7 years, @LOCATION3 will be run by computer. Do we want that, @CAPS8! so lets put a stop to it now. Thank you very much!",6,5,1

They have to be used in moderation though, because exercise and staying healthy is good. I hope you will share my opinions in your next article to help pursude readers on my view of computers. What I believe is the best thing about computers, is that it is a great source to learn. The internet can connect all over the world, and you can learn about other cultures. You can know everything about that country without ever visiting! Or you can use it to find out about you family's history. Many record keeping systems are switching to computers now. When we took a field trip to @LOCATION1 they had data bases there that had every name of the people that went through there. Studies show that @NUM1 people find the internet easy to use, and quicker than any method. Another thing about computers is they help you in the work place. Lets say you had a job designing houses to be built. In old times you would have to draw it out by hand using numerous instruments and tools, but now you could make the design using just one tool, the computer. It is a much away way to to you job and if assists the customers because before if the wanted the house to be a different you would have help to draw it all over again. Now you just have to make an ajustment on the computer and in seconds its done with the new design. These day if not @PERCENT2 then @PERCENT1 of house designers use computers. Computers also play in a social role. On the internet you can connect and chat with friends. Also you could share pictures of both of you at a baseball game @DATE1 to keep memories. Or you can send them a website with a really funny video of someone getting with a soccerball. Experts did a study and it showed that @NUM2 times the reason a teen goes on the internet is to connect with friends. ""@CAPS2 @PERSON1 (computer expert and developer) what do you think the number one reaso teen use computers teen use computers is?"" @CAPS3, I would have to say to chat with friends. I dont see why they wouldn't, it's simple and almost in ."" Computers are, a great advancement in our technology. They assist us in everyday life, life and make difficult tasks simple. They should not be over used though and you need to keep a healthy mind and body. All of the thing we could learn from them though help in the argument of that. To me the computer is the same step forward as the light bulb was. Computer source found @PERCENT3 of in @LOCATION2, and. I believe they will be in all of our homes. Some families find them @CAPS2 useful the have more than one in the household. They can come in all shapes and sized to fit your wants and needs, and can connect you to anything in the world.",5,6,1
1287,"To begin with, The learning ability people get from it has improved. The @CAPS1 source is very helpful to many people. The communication is much easier than talking on the phone. I believe that computers benefit the society in many different ways. First of all, children and people at home and at school use computers for learning purposes. In some grades at school there is a special typing program that helps improve typing skills. There are also hard drive discs that you can play with to help you enhance on your reading skills. It is just a way to make learning fun for young kids. Another great way to learn online is going to websites that have sample math problem and print the sheet out to practice. They are great ways to help learning. Secondly, the computer has many more ways to benifit someone. They are helpful for getting your local weather. In the winter you can see if your school has cancelled in seconds. Often I get projects where it calls for me to do research on a specific topic and it is very easy to look up simple information. The computer also has different links that are helpful for writing a paper, making a power point presentation, and excel spread sheet. All of those resources can either help graphing results for science class or even typing up a paper for @CAPS2. They are useful ways to make life easier. Lastly, computers tend to make communication a little easier. For me, when I'm out sick from school I like to tell my teachers by emailing them and even asking if I can make up any work using facebook, aim, myspace, and skype are all fun and fast ways to communicate with friends. All of the websites pretty much do the same thing but different people like diffrent sites that their friends are on you can email friends and family who live far away and even close. It's a way to get back and forth to eachother. In conclusion, you have heard the different ideas and I consider computers as a benifit. It helps learn, communicate, and most of all do the important things that we need.",5,5,1
809,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers do not benefit society. They make people antisocial, unhealthy, and do bad things. The internet is very addictive. I use to spend three hours online everyday. I did not get any exersice at all. Also, I was incouraged to eat unhealthy snacks while online. This made me very unhealthy I gained nine pounds in one week. Now, I have dietbeaties. I can't enjoy things like sweets or running. I will probably have arthritus in my hands when I'm older because I spent hours typing away. I used the computer in the dark so now I need contacts. Using the computer is one of the most unhealthy choices ever. II spent so much time on the computer i wasn't able to socialized. I missed out on alot of activities with my friends and family because I was so busy online. I barely talked to anyone unless it was through email. I lost alot of friends and close family members. My pets died because I didn't take care of them. I didn't really want to do anything but go on the net. I messed up on colledge and job interviews. To this day I have no social life and no job because I spent more time socializing with the computer than people. Computers ruined my life. Computers incourage very bad things. Not just unhealthy choices and antisocial behavior they uncourage things against the law. Alot of drugs and weapons are bought online. People kill others or themselves because people gossiped about them online. People don't care for nature and destroy it. People steal so they can buy extra technology. Alot of car robbers happen because someone left technology in there. People gamble through online poker. People hack bank acounts through the computer. Prostitution happens because of online chats. Thier are sex affenders that go online posing as people that want a date when they are rapists. Terrorists can communicate by the internet. Computers are a menace to society. They turn people into low life scums and criminals. Computers should disposed of before they cause the end of the world.",4,5,0
547,"Dear @CAPS1, I @CAPS2 that computers has benefits to society. First, it gives and teaches you social skills. Next, computers can help you learn new things online. Finally, computers also teach you hand-eye coordination. In the following you will see why I @CAPS2 computers have its benefits to the society. First, computers has its benefits to society because it can teach or give you the social skills you need. On a computer you can interact with others from around the world and make new friends. Therefore, you can learn about their culture and what they do in their country. Also, you can talk and interact with family that does not live with you or is not with you in the moment. So as you can see, Computers has its benefits because it can teach you social skills. Next the benefits it has to society is people can learn things online. for example, you can learn how to use a computer if you don't already know how. Also, you could play online learning games for free or buy a @CAPS3 with more options for learning. Another example is you can look up recent or past events you want to know about and research it. So as you can see, Computers benefit society because you can learn all types of things online. Finally, computers how its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination. for example, you can find all types of games using hand-eye coordination using the mouse and keyboard. Also if you just want time to go by you can use the computer as entertainment by chatting with other and playing games. Believe it or not, you can find boat loads of jobs that uses a computer for any of these also as you can see computers have its benefits because it teaches you hand-eye coordination and gives you some free-time entertainment. In conclusion, computers have its benefits to the social community. First, it helps you learn your social skills. Next, you can learn about any subject online for free if your not the one paying the internet bill finally, it benefits you by teaching you hand-eye coordination. So as you can see, I @CAPS2 that computers benefits society in plenty of ways.",4,4,0
1366,"Dear Local newspaper, I think that computers have a bad effect on people because they will have no time to exercise, less time with friends and family, and it could give a younger child a bad influence. Here are my detailed reasons. The most important reason why computers have a bad effect on people is that the time they spend on the computer they could be exercising to stay healthy. For example my mom runs @NUM1 miles everyday and still has time to go on the computer. If you use the computer @NUM2 its bad, but if you use it in moderation then its a little better. For instance my mom lets me go me go on the computer, but she @CAPS1 makes me go outside and run around @CAPS1 people are always talking about obesity, and computers are one way its happening to kids and adults. They just sit their on the computer and do nothing while on the other hand they could be outside. Here is my second reason. The next most important thing is that kids and adults won't have time to spend time with their families and share memories with them. My mom always tells me the best part of your childhood is making memories with the people you love. My friends and I love to be outside and go to playgrounds and act like little kids, but it makes us laugh and people say that laughing keeps you happy and healthy. Here is my last reason. The last most important reason is it can give a younger chilld the wrong ideas. For example I have @NUM1 younger sisters and they love to go on the computer and some websites are not good for younger kids. One website could be @CAPS2 because bad peole post videos and the little children could see then and get the wrong idea. Here is my conclusion. In conclusion I think computers have a bad effect on people because they spend less time staying healthy, less time and with friends and family and it gives kids the wrong idea. I hope I got my point across that they are bad.",4,4,0
239,"I personally think that people should not spend so much time on the computer. One reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is because people spend to much time on them and not enough time exercising. Another reason why is because people aren't enjoying nature. Finally, my last reason is because people are spending less time interacting with family ans friends. My first reason why people shouldn't spend so much time on the computer is bacause they are spenfing more time on them then exercising. People will end up getting fat if all they do is sit around on their computer. People should be running or going to the gym instead of going on the computer. Even if you have your own equipment at your house to exercis on it's still better then going on the computer and not getting any exercise at all. If people spent as much time exercising then they spend on the computer, then the average weight of a human will go way down. Another reason people should't spend so much time on the computer is because people are spending less time enjoying nature. People should be outside getting fresh air instead of being inside on the computer all day. I personally would way rather be outside playing baseball and getting fit then being inside on the computer getting fat. Even if you look at nature via comuter, it still wan't be the same because you actually aren't outside experiencing it yourself. If people waould spend as much time enjoying nature as they are on the computer. We would be living in a much more healthy and clean word. My last reason why I think people spend so much time on the computer is because they are spending less time interacting with family and friends. People could be in a dark room all day, isolated from everyone they came about just because they are on the computer. That to me just isn't right because they covered he spending quality time with their friends and family, instead they are spending time with their computer. If a person spends all their time on the computer then everyone they care about will gradually be slipping away even if they don't know it. So as you can see, it would be much better if people spend more time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends then spending more time on the computer. even if you don't spend alot of your time on the computer yet, you will gradually spend more and more time on it everyday until eventually it's all you do.",5,4,1
209,"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects of computers on people is that staying on a computer is not that bad it does not rot you brain like video games. are some good reasons why computers are good and help you. Sometimes computers do help with hand-eye coordination. You use the computer to do homework or to search a a stores etc. Some computers are really slow but not all of the new ones for @DATE1, computers can also help you read better it has little . You could play talk to people like your friends. Listening to music is an easy thing to you could a website that has all songs that you like to listen yo many people use the computer to find jobs and use it to look for ways to eat right and work out paying bills online is easyer than paying them for real. The computer is easy way to pay and you should agree with @CAPS1 opinion.",3,3,0
1084,"Computers is a good benefit for people. First, computer is a helpful machine in diffrent ways, like I personally go on computer and check for my homework with it. Computer is also good because whenever you donÂ’t know something, you can just go on the internet and search it. Computers won't effect out health if we donÂ’t use it for a long time, computers could help students making project. By using word, exell and other microsoft ware. So I think computers are a great machine for people to have. Secondly, using computer could also socialize with people, many students inculding me uses face book, so even if we are not right next to each other, we can still talk. Computers could be used to make new friends too, Â“but their is people you donÂ’t know and we are not surpose to give out our information.Â” said @PERSON1 our health teacher. Computers could be useful to friends that live far away, if your friend moved to another state, you could use computer to chat with him, their is many ways to social with computers. Lastly, exercising is important to everyone, but using computers doesnÂ’t mean we can not go outside and exersice anymore, maybe computers are addictive, but if you keep track of time and maybe use the computer for - half an hour at a time, you can still get the exercise you need. Exercising is an easy thing to do, children likes to exercise so their sould not be a problem, like my nabor alway come over to my house and ask if I want to play football while I was talking with someone on the computers but I still went outside and play, so computer is a great machine thats not very addictive so parents doesnÂ’t have to worry about children exercising. I think computers have great effects on people, like going online to do a research or talk to friends. Grown ups need them to work. So that proves computer is a great machine.",4,5,0
866,"Dear, Local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are everything, They provide with so many things for you to do like chess, listening to music, and even downloading you favorite movies. First of all, computers are a great source of communication because if you have a long distance relative that lives in @LOCATION1 then you can talk to them online. You can do this through via email.

666,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION2, I believe that computers have a positive affect on people who use them. Because they teach hand eye coordination, give us the ability to learn about far away people and places and allow us to chat online with people. @CAPS3 first reason of why I think computers have a positive affect on people is that they teach hand eye coordination. For example, we need to use our hand-eye coordination skills when we type to @CAPS2 the letters. This helps us increase our Hand eye coordination because it helps us think about what letters we are typing, @CAPS2 the letters on the keyboard, and push them. Also when we type long passages it increase our hand eye coordination becaue we get used to wrighting the long paragraphs and we become more familiar with where the letters are on the keyboard and our speed increases,which means we can get more work done in a shorter time. Believe it or not @PERSON1 free of the @ORGANIZATION1 hospital took a survey that showed @NUM1 people who type essays instead of wrighting them by hand, have a greater hand eye coordination skill. Computers also allow us to learn about far away people and places. For example computers make it easier to reaserch far away people and places. Useing a computer can help us understand and learn about people and places withought a trip to the library. Also computers allow us to @CAPS2 us to @CAPS2 more info about recent events that have just around the world. Also computers make it faster to reserch topics because looking for a book in those big libraries can be stressfull, not to mention dificult. Also informat on a computer can never be checked out or not availible like library books. Lastly you have information right at our fingerries so you will never have to leave youre house, @CAPS3 last reason is that computers allwo us to chat online with other people. This can help us because it allows us to talk to friends and family from around the world. Also it helps us talk to our parents if theyre away or if you're on a camping trip. Chating on a computer is a great way to make friends with people you dont know and block people you dont want talking to you. So in a sence you can be in controll of your friendships and who youre friends with. Computers are the greatist advance in technology sence the wheel and they have helped so many people.",4,4,0

People just don't understand the present day. Society is a whole lot different then when parents were kids. People just don't get modern day society. I'm going to tell you the advantages and disadvantages to computers. There are a lot of advantages to computers. You can find information fast. Communication with people around the world is a huge advantage. Computers keep kids and teens entertained. There are games on websites. Computers are the thing we use today. A lot of things are done by computers, computers also prevent you from wasting money on books because you could just google it. There are a lot of disadvantages to computers. They cost a lot of money. Computers can down. There could also be dumb websites that have no purpose like facebook and myspace. Computers are complicated if you don't grow up with them it's hard to learn. The government has all they're information in computers. If they didn't people would be able to steal information a lot.

1047,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, Computers are destroying modern youth. The rapid advancement in technology is not a positive thing. The popular social networks such as facebook and twitter are putting youth at danger of @CAPS1-@CAPS2 and child predators. Children are also becoming addicted to computers and are paying the price physically. Although we are becoming a smarter species, we are destroying the ones who will soon lead the world. This crazy computing must end! Although children are able to socialize using the computer, they are at danger of being hurt physically and emotionally. ""I really tried to ignore all of the cruel comments people were posting about me. I tried as hard as I could, but everytime I logged unto facebook and looked at what people said about me, I died inside. I almost had no desire to live."" That quote was said by @PERSON1, a former student of @ORGANIZATION1. He is as victim of @CAPS1-@CAPS2. Thousands of students just like @PERSON1 are being pestered just as bad, and if not worse.

This computer madness is losing lives, we cannot allow this to continue. Not only are computers causing emotional danger, but also physical. The average teenager spends between one to four hours on the computer - making the one hour of exercise seem miniscule. The large number of obese children is in large part caused by computers. The many features of computers, such as instant messaging, music playing, and games, draw kids in - making them spen time they could use exercising, in front of a computer. Statistics show that the average obese child spends @PERCENT1 their free time on a computer. The time they spend exercising and playing makes up only five percent of their day.

599,"There has been a debate weather computers benefit society or hurt society. I personnaly agree with th statement that computers benefit in society. I think that computers do improve your hand-eye coordination. When you can type fast and accuratly you know your hand eye coordination is doing well. I remeber as a kid I would watch my grandmother type about seventy-five words per minute. Just from her year of practice, she becamr very computer coordinated. My hand-eye coordination is becoming a lot better because I have types for a long time. Scientists say that @PERCENT2 or people that type for at least four years become better hand-eye coordinated typing fast keeps your fingers quick and agile. I once read a book on computers and an expert said ""the invention of the computer keyboard could possibly be the greates hand-eye coordination practice ever."" @CAPS1 plus about computers is that they allow you to learn about far away places wtihout really going there. In school you can do projects on other countries without traveling just by using a computer. I once had to do a class project on @LOCATION1 and got a @PERCENT1 just by using a computer, people can look up information on countries for pleasure too. Mu mom just wanted to learn about @LOCATION2 so she just looked it up on the internet from her computer. You can research schoold too. My older sister went online to bok at collges without acctually traveling to the actual college states. Finally one more thing you can do on a computer is talk to people online. There is such a thing as @CAPS2-mail which allows you to write people over the internet on the computer. I remember when my baseball coach was going to tell me I made the team he just @CAPS2-mailed my parents because it was the most simple way to get it done. There is also such a thing as @CAPS4 (instant messaging) that allows you to imediatly talk to somebody and for them to immidiatly talk to you back. I remeber I used to go on @CAPS4 everyday to talk to friends. Also you can video chat which allows you to directly see somebody and actually talk to them physically. I read a news article on video chatting and an expert said ""video chatting is the single best way to communicate with someone without being right inforn of them talking with them. These reasons are why I think computers are a big help in our society.",4,4,0
1221,"Dear @CAPS1 or @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 people believe that computors are harmful to our society because people spend more time on such technology. I believe that this is not the reason our society is falling today although I agree that people spend to much time on the computor. Computors are actually helpful in our society because it is an advance in communication. People have found ways to communicate with other people through plugging in a web cam and mic. Not only does the computor help communication but it also helps us gain information on modern day society like the news to stay up-to-date. This complicated device can also save files and documents by typing them in so that if it is lost you could just reprint it out. One main thing that people of modern day technology usually do is talk to faraway friends and family on spare time. Legal websites allow people to be informed of a friend or family about events that have ocurred like an incident or an up coming event. @CAPS2 experts like @PERSON1, who specializes in the behavior of people, says that this is a number one cause of obeisity and prevents people from meeting other people outside or even plain exercise. I would say this isn't completely true because before even talking to anyone. Online people usually go for a jog around the neighborhood. Information is vital in our society and keeps us up-to-date on modern life. A computor can give us certain information like news and whether report. These days every smart person would go search information on a computor for not only missed news but for future forecast on whether to plan a picnic. This would be a helpful tool to our society in order to keep up with the world and not miss the latest event. I believe this is an advance in our modern day society because you could get the information you need. When you are in a rush to go to work don't you end up losing papers and files just forgetting about them? The computor can send data to a computor to conviently copy a file or document so you won't have to rush to work and worry about lost files. It has been known that thirty out of fifty people have saved themselves from losing a job from a computor. The computor can also hold and store data for later use like a song or picture. You could send that file and listen to it on another computor. Now is the time to decide if you should support computors. The computor can help you talk to long lost friends of one touch of a button. If you need certain information than you could find it on a computor without ever leaving your comfortable home. last and not least you could hold important files and documents and save yourself the trouble from rushing to work. So go and type that letter to a representative to help people see that computors are good for our society.",4,6,0

For example, what if your boss wats to find the of products ? All you have to do is go to www.google.com, and look it up! Is is that easy. Also what if you need to do reasearch on @ORGANIZATION1 for school? Instead of reading books about him, you can type in his name, and theres your information. In @CAPS1 @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids/adults use the computer for research. This is my first reason. Secondly, purchases can be made. What if you would like to buy a plane ticket to @LOCATION1 to help? You can go on the computer and buy a ticket at your convenience. You can order order all types of that needed to @LOCATION1. Or that a relative/friend can have a. How way simplier than going out and doing it yourself. This is my second reason. Lastly you can talk and video chat. You own a other people, and you all in diffreent country need a a video meeting. What if you have relatives that live far away that you miss alot? You can have a video family. this is my last reason. I hope you consider my reasons why computers are very important to society.",4,4,0

My opinion on this matter is that agree that computer are bad and people are spending. Too much time on computer.

Cearly you can that people spending too much time on computer and less time exercising.

We told and him told him spending to much time on computers is bad for you. Another reason why spending too much time on computer is bad because you need to learn how to enjoy nature and get out scid.

77,"Dear Newspaper, In @DATE1's world we are dependent on computers. @DATE1 computers have become the most helpful source of technology. We need computers for so many things, and they benefit society. They can help people talk online, they're educational, and they improve hand eye cordination. It has been amazing how computers help us so much. We need computers like we need water. If we didn't how would we survive? Computers have become the glue to friendships. They help keep friendships when you don't see the friend constantly. I have a friend that moved to @LOCATION1 last year. It was way too expensive to just call ot text her. So as a result, I keep in contact with her through the computer. Everyday we @CAPS1 and use skype to keep intouch. Those cost @MONEY1 per year. If I were to call her each call would cost @MONEY2. if it weren't for the internet I seriously know that our friendship would collapse. Computers have been so helpful for many people with this same problem. Computers have become the number one source to find information. They have become more popular than the library and text books combined. So many essential resources are on computers. Text books, calculators, and even homework are online. Many people say that computers aren't educational, but scientists say it can move a students grade from a @CAPS2- to an A+. Teachers say the same thing too. one of my fellow students said that computers changed his life. He used to be forgetting to write down his homework, but he looks online and he has all of it. Now he knows what pages to read from the science book. If you don't think that computers have changed students lives, well think again. There are also games that improves hand eye cordination. Many sports teams like the @CAPS3 use this. It has increased there hand eye cordination by @PERCENT1. the team says if it wasn't for the hand eye cordination game, then they would have never have won the @CAPS4 @CAPS5. this game is also free online for anyone to use. Everyone that has used it said it really improved there reaction time. The games are also fun and non violent. They have games like baseball, hockey, and hurdles. This game has made a great improvement on people's lives. If we don't have computers then our hand eye cordination will decrease by @PERCENT2. would you want to be the person to take away computers? In conclusions computers have made a great impact on @DATE1's society. Computers are educational, you get to talk to friends, and improve your hand eye cordination. Computers have made a big improvement on how we live, and it's for the better. If we didn't have computers then friendships would break, grades would decrease, and hand eye cordination would plummit. We need computers they have been so beneficial to billions of people across the globe. Many people depend on computers. So if we take away computers then you'll be letting many lives down. No sane person would want to take away computers. Computers have benifited society in so many ways. ",5,5,1
110,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers are good to society, because you can read the news paper online, email your friends and family, and can play games and watch videos or movies. Knowing the latest news is very important, news paper are okay but you have to pay for them with the news paper online you can get the latest news for free! This way you can save money and trees. Heres another way of saving trees. E-mailing is a good to talk so some one far away and it's a lot faster than just regular old mailing. E-mail is also good for e-mailing links to cool websites, on e-mail can send a funny picture or a video or an important notice. So, Computers can be your news paper and a good and fast way of communication. It also can be useful for entertainment. Computers are one of the most popular entertainment sources. Computers allow you to go on game sites, watch videos or movies or play on online game on just a regular @CAPS1 game. I know whenever I'm bore I go on my computer and I can always find something to don on line or find a movie to watch. So, computers are very popular, in many areas computers are helpful in news, communication, and entertainment. People just need to look at the positive aspects of computers, then they will see how great they are",3,3,0
9,"Dear reader, @ORGANIZATION1 has had a dramatic effect on human life. It has changed the way we do almost everything today. The most well know, is the computer. This device has allowed people do buy things online, talk to people online, and also provides entertainment for some people. All good qualities that make everyones lives easier. Imagine you look into your refrigerator and you notice it's almost empty. Someone is using the car and you need to go grocery shopping and the store is too far. What do you do? Well you could go on a computer and look for food online. Ther are many great deals and some companies even deliver for free! The amazing and easy way to buy food without leaving your house. But food isn't all you can purchase. Many products are sold through the computer. Need new toys for kids? Or how about a new hat for your friend? Maybe even more curtains for your room? Well at the easy access of internet on a computer, you can buy all those items and more. The computer has also the way of communication. Let's say someone wants to talk to a friend or relative that lives far away in another country. @CAPS1 someone dosen't own a phone or @CAPS1 they can't make the call, all these is to be in you on the computer. You can communicate with anyone just by using your email adress. Now friends and families can talk to each other over the ease of the computer. Just type to want to say and ""boom,"" instant, on the chat. Let's face it. No matter what a child or even teenager . But now with a computer all that can change. With just one click you could actually be watching a movie from the comfort of your own home. But what @CAPS1 you don't want a movie? No entertainment like listing to musics, watching fun, and probable the most popular playing games. Everyone loves to play a game every once in a while, and with the selection of thousands of online games, these isn't or person who can't fled atleast our game enjoyable. There are even games for educational fun that many kids love. With all the entertainment a computer can produce; who could hate it? All in all the computer is a revolutinizing device that has changes the way we shop, communicate, and find exciting entertainment. To be able to do so much with just a couple clicks; new that I find extravagant. It blows my mind to see and think, ""@CAPS1 we can do this now, I wonder what we can accomplish in the future.",4,5,0
1361,"In modern society, @CAPS3 is rare that you come across someone who doesn't know how to basicly operate a computer. According to the statistics project known on youtube as ""shift happens"", most children in the @LOCATION1, @PERCENT1 in facts, have used a computer by age four. While @CAPS3 can be debated that computers are bad, i firmly disagree. Computers are one of the best technological advances the human race has made. they have helped education, reconnecting, and are even at times good for the environment. I wonder why people disagree, and i hope that after reading this, you will too. At my schoo, there are three computer labs, each with about twenty five computers, a library with twenty computers, and each teacher has two computers in their classroom. Wheni look at these amounts and addit to what i know about computers in other @CAPS1 schools, @CAPS3 is clear to me that computers have helped the education system. Many teachers can have students research projects with the click of a button. There are websites where students who were out from school can get their assignments for the next day. Also, teachers can put their grade books in their had drive. This saves paper and ensures accuracy in the final grade. As a student, i think that computers have greatly improved schools in many ways, but mostly in those above. At one point or another in life, we are all older and want to reconnect with our old friends. Thanks to computers, the process of reconnecting is much easier. There are social networks such as facebook, twitter, and @CAPS2, that are valuable for finding your friend from @DATE1 camp. Let's say you have been connected with someone, and you've just found out that you got a promotion. You want to call, but you don't know the hone number, but you know the email address. Email messages send instantly to anywhere. (And while you're at @CAPS3, ask for a phone number!) @CAPS3's always great to talk with old friends. Computers have helped @LOCATION1 make that easier. My friend recently purchased a sony laptop. She liked not only the features, but that @CAPS3 was an energystar, or eco-friendly. Now a days, computers have been made green in the battle for the environment. Paper is saved with online encylopedias, newspapers, journals, etc. Not only that but computers are needing less and less electricity. You save green and are green! Today's society is helping mother nature not only in our actions, but in computers too. In my opinion, computers are helping @LOCATION1, not hurting @LOCATION1. They have assisted education, social reconnecting and the environment. We must look kindly upon the advancement and miracle invention known as the computer.",5,5,1
181,"Dear Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are machines that have been around for @MONTH1 years. With internet, you can do things like play games, research information, and even talk to friends and family, all through a computer. Advances in computer technology are beneficial to @CAPS1 society for several reasons. These includes that computers improve hand-eye coordination, provide abundant information, and allow people to talk online. As said earlier, using a computer can improve hand-eye coordination. In fact, it is known that computers can immensely improve your reflexes. This reminds me of a time when my brother went to an eye doctor and was told that his eyes had trouble focusing. Patrick, my brother, was then literally assigned by the doctor to play computer games to help his hand-eye coordination. As a matter of fact, @PERCENT1 agree that computers can have a gargantuah, positive impact on reflexes and hand-eye coordination. If computers heldful in this way and, in some cases, necessary for your eyes, then why would the use of computers be classified as bad when they are clearly a beneficial factor in @CAPS1 society? Computers are also beneficial because of what huge resource they are. the internet offers so much information for people of all ages who want to learn and thrive. For example, most schools have their students use computers for research. When I say most schoold, I mean @PERCENT2 of schools assign students to research using a computer. Principal of new city @ORGANIZATION2, @PERSON2 says, ""@CAPS1 students use computers at leat every week if not more. They are fantastic resource with endless information."" Computers are getway to countless amounts of knowledge that everyone should have access to. It is well known that almost everyone knows someone who lives far away. I, myself, have friend who lives in @LOCATION1 that I miss very much. When long-distance phone calls are too expensive most of the world and I rely on computers to talk to out far-away friends. Computers are the bridge between @CAPS2; (my @CAPS3 friend) and I. However, computers are not only used long distance. I also use computers to e-mail, instant message, video chat, and just stay connected to family and friends. A local teenage boy, @PERSON1, says. ""I use my computer to stay connected with friends and my family that lives in another county. I don't know what I would do without it."" This means that @PERSON1 and thousands of others rely on computers for communication with friends and Family. Computers are necessary for @MONTH1 reasons. They help people, educate, and connect people. You must have access to a computer in my opinion, in order to thrive in life.",5,5,1
669,"@ORGANIZATION1, I am writing this letter to inform you about the Use of computers. Computers can be fun and interesting, But, people are spending to much time on the computer. @CAPS3 opinion is you should spend time interacting with people in your society, your family, and friends. I also think that @CAPS2 is easy to get addicted to the computer, I should @CAPS1 I was a person that spent @CAPS3 time @NUM1 on the computer and @CAPS2 wasn't good. You should be safe on the computer because now and days @CAPS2's dangerous @CAPS2 is appalling that people spend More time on the computer than with ther own Family. Don't you agree? Well you shoud, your society, family, and friend should be the most important thing to you. You shouldn't be spending your whole day on the computer, you should be interacting with the people around you. Now and days you will see plenty of people on the computer and not spending time with there family. That shouldn't be going on. Although the computer is fun and interesting you will have people around you the wisher to spend time with you. You should think about this because this is happening to much in the world. @PERCENT1 of the people in @CAPS3 school say their addicted to the computer, and @PERCENT2 of the people in @CAPS3 community say their addicted to the computer too. Those are very high numbers don't you think? This is terrible and should stop going on. The computer is like a drug, you can get on the computer one time, then your just going to want to stay on ti everyday all day. The first time you get on the computer you will be addicted to @CAPS2 right away. I'm not saying you should never get on the computer, but be sure you won't get too addicted to @CAPS2 because @CAPS2 can happen very easily. @CAPS3 mother always sayed be safe on the computer"". At first I didn't really @CAPS1 what she meant, but now I @CAPS1. What ever you do on the computer will stay their and be saved no matter how you try to delete @CAPS2. So, you should be safe and don't put any thing on the computer if you would want anyone else to see @CAPS2. Anyone can see what you put so you should be safe. Kids are meeting people they don't @CAPS1 and try to meet them. So you should watch out because the computer is the only place @CAPS7 you can lie. Now you should understand @CAPS7 im coming from. You should now agree with me and under stand that people should spend more time you don't get addicted and be safe.""",4,4,0
1534,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 oppinon about computers are that people should use them. Think about your children, when they grow up they will need to know how to use a computer for school, or even a job. It also teaches hand eye cordanation for multi tasking. The computer is also fun and easy to use. I am almost positve that you love to use a computer, who dosn't? @CAPS2 first reason is that you will need to use a computer in everyday life. For example if you are going to a job interview most @CAPS3 will ask how meny words a minuet can you type you need to be proficant. Also at school if you have a writing asinment due then it would take more time writing it than typeing it. All @CAPS3 you will have to type one time or another. Aspesaily your job as an @CAPS1 you need to use a computer everyday. The computer also teaches hand eye cordanation. Hand eye cordanation is kinda like multi tasking you could type and talk on the phone or even excircising and txting. Hand eye cordanation is a very important skill in life. All @CAPS3 you will need to multi task like at a library you need to find a book and talk to people. Even driving a car you need to multi task to stay on the hand, you need to use one fast from brake and gas and you need to be looking at the road. You must to multi task along with hand eye cordination. Your in luck a computer teaches you. @CAPS2 last and final reason is its fun and easy to use. I was @NUM1 when I started uing a computer I loved to play fun games. I never could type but I caught on because if you are having fun while you it will be easy to turn. Just like math its not fun but you have to larn how to do it. So if you like having fun while lurning some thing the computer is for you. It's now or never for people to larn, get @CAPS3 and get good grades. Its fun and easy to lurn how to use. It teaches you hand eye cordanation plus multi tasking. You will absolutly need to know how to use a computer for @CAPS3 and school. We need computers for life we always will need to use computers for every single day of our lives.

1148,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you probably have seen there is a lot of controversy over wether computers are helpful or harmful. I for one agree computers are helpful because, they help you learn about new things, talk to people around the world, and try new things. For instance have you ever wondered what the capital of @LOCATION6 is? Well with the you could find that answer in the blink of an eye, that's because the internet gives you unparraellel information that no book has. The internet seally lets you see what is happening in or world because there are various news sources, and blogs on the internet, @PERSON1 do you remember the earthquake in @LOCATION4 well I sure do, because I found it out on the internet. You can also find directions to places, sports stats and about different places. Well whats a better way to find out a bout those than talking with people who live there? I don't think anything is, seriously is it better reading about @LOCATION5 or talking to someone in @LOCATION5? Thats the beauty of the internet is it bonds the world together into a tighter realationship, I remember chatting with people from @LOCATION3 while the gold medal game @PERSON3. Sure some people would say that you could meet someone in person from a different country, well how would you meet someone from @LOCATION2 in @LOCATION1, because I never have. People could say go to the place to talk to the person and, with the internet, it's very possible. Have you @PERSON1 wanted to go to @PERSON4? Well with the internet all you need is your credit card and you could be there tomorrow because the internet allows you to try new things. Have you ever wanted to try pingpong, it so you could or does a set offline and have it shipped to you in a couple of days, I always wanted to go to a zoo but, I didn't know of any, so I used the internet and see school for zoos near @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1 and before I could move the results for @PERSON2 zoo were right infront of me. That is why the internet is very helpful. To sum it all up the internet is very helpful to people who use it correctly, but I agree that the internet can be inappropriate. With blackson the not needed sites the internet can do almost anything.",5,4,1
1296,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have some opinions on technology is going these days and about how many people shun the idea of further advancement for the understandable reasons that it brings people away from family and that it draws people's attention away from the rest of the world I do see their point but I'd like to make a point myself. While statistics show a @PERCENT1 decline in recreational activities people also find more things to do and now that the world is more concerneD for the environment you will probably see people coming outside again because they heard about some new environmental actavist group to join or they watch a movie that makes fun of live action role playing and decide to give it a whirl. My point being that you never know what your going to discover in the media and its better than sitting outside all day with no insperation, waiting for your parents to get home and give you information from outside you tiny world. The other item I will mention is the music industry and how it is revolutionized with more advanced, and different ways of listening to it in fact the only problem in music today are the artist and how they take advantage of recording studies and on occasion another just to gain fame! Without doing anything but sit back and lip sync. But the technology of the day give us the ability to listen to music the golden age of music now. So why not advance and invest in the music industry, it will provide entertainment and fun for years to come. Advanceing technology is the music industry actually is probably good for the economey as well I mean if we didn'@CAPS4 have new @CAPS3 to bell to people every year that would be a huge decline in stock market prices not that were not in a crash right now but it wouldn'@CAPS4 be any better. That goes for cell phones too and any other piece of hardware that gets frequently upgraded it's just good for buisness. You see I belive that the point of life is joy so whats better than settling down with mabey a date some candlelight and a romance or thriller on the @CAPS4.V most people will enjoy just sitting down and watching the telly it's easy to relate to. The television has evolved in many good ways it's a way to lay down and unwind learn about so many different things mabey watch a show on @LOCATION1 it makes you feel like being there without actually being there.

Are computers the cause of increased awkwardness in today's society. Certainly it can't be to good that your entire life is documented on a place where anyone can go. And then there is the content of what you are viewing. I can't wait to get to that paragraph. One of the top @NUM1 picked-through subjects in the world, are people really less interested in exercise than they were in the @NUM2's? studies show that in the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, @NUM3 out of @NUM1 people were overweight. That number has risen to @NUM5 out of @NUM1, as of @DATE1. Amazing! And some of these people might be safer staying inside. If you've played a video game where the player can lose health, you'll know what happens when the bar runs out. You restart. After playing @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @MONTH1 want to try that gravity-defying, head-turning stunt. And let me tell you, there is no restarting after that. Did you know that @ORGANIZATION1 is recording everything you do online? If say, you are a budding guitarist and are looking around for a new gibson, you'll start getting all these ads for online stores, @CAPS12? Because @ORGANIZATION1 sells your info to businesses. And you give them permission by clicking that continue with install button. So spam email comes. But something even worse is on the way. Your bank account number. Thats right, I went there. If a virus get onto your computers, your many could vanish. So be responsible. This brings us to our last subject. The touchy one. It used to be that you had to buy a magazine or book to witness the exploitation of young women. Now, it is just the click of a button away. And that is bad enough. Young boys are snagged early, their futures now controlled by this disease. But add to that the imense risk of a virus attack, and you're in a heap of trouble. So I'm not saying computers are terrible, just that they they could be to much of a good thing. Sometimes they can be a good way to relieve stress, by taking it out on a hapless alien. Just use the technology at your hands responsibly.",5,6,1

1773,"Dear @CAPS1 newspaper, I have resently read that ther are some people do not agree with computers. They belive that people use them all the time. I dissagre with them. One of my examples of why I disagree is because they give a person the ability to talk to someone. This is a great idea! What if your friend moved a few states over wouldn't you still want to communicate? Well, with high long-distance rates, many cna't afford this and how would you see your friend anymore? Well, if you send her pics, or video chat over the web, you can! Also, its a great idea if you want to send a small mesage like ""see you at @NUM1"", instead of saying it on the phone, and paying more, when its free on the computer. The computer also teachs hand-eye coordiantion that is important to use in the world. You can play games, take quiza and tests, go to school on the internet, even listin to music, that is important for us to express. Also there are sites that allow you to learn how to use a keyboard, and work electronics like a computer! And lastly, the computer gives you the ability to see far away places without even beiong there. This helps you do a project on a place you have never been, plan a family reunion or vacation, or find a place where you can have that fun in the shining sun, many people think that too many people are staying in front of their computer than exercising and being outside. To prevent that, they should just limit themselfs to the amount of computer and electronic time they have per day and then go exercise go to a faraway place. So, the computer teachs hand-eye coordiantion, allows you to talk to others,and allows you to see far away places. Don't you think that is great? Think about it. ",4,4,0

If you control the amount of time you use on a computer then you will be fine. Please keep reading to hear my great ideas. To start off, computers and other technology make life easier. Think about it we have access to our bank accounts, stores, reasearch, school, etc. See instead of having to go at shoppingfor food you could just order it online with no trouble. We can now shop @CAPS4 cloths and other household items. It'so easy just to look at a list and pick what you want instead of waiting in a long line. @CAPS4 example, I went to @CAPS1 to pick up a few items @CAPS4 a party. There a long line, so I just got online picked what i wanted and had it shipped to me unless then @NUM2 hours! Its cool to not have to even got up to get what you want. I know you sometimes have your since you don't wanna get up? But you have to go shopping. Doesn't computers make life so easy. Secondly, talk to family and friends without having to spend money. This is awesome because you can text, video chat, email @CAPS4 free. Computers have so many websites to talk to your family and friends like, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, myspace, yahoo, and even ohvoo. Mostly, all those you can video chat and voice chat @CAPS4 free. All of those sites you can text @CAPS4 free and touch those with your @CAPS4 example, one day I didn't want spend my to talk to my friend. So I just video chatted with them. And it was @NUM3 times better and free and better. Even @CAPS4 people long distanceis way to much money in call them. So why not just video chat I know you wouldn't wanna spend hundreds of dollars @CAPS4 a phone call bill! Please keep reading. Thirdly, if you count he amount of time you use on he computer of other technology devices then you will be fine. If you limit and set a time on the use of your computer everything will be wonderful. You can tell your body to get off the pc and get a work out or talk to friends. There's no way you could be addicted to something if you have a limited @CAPS4 it. If your the type of person that is a at something. Then @MONTH1 be you shouldn't get a computer. Like my mom gives me a limited @CAPS4 the computer @NUM4 my laptop has to be off on a school night. An @NUM3:00pm my laptop has to be off on the weekends. There's alway ways to not to be addicted. You just have to know when enough is enough. Its not the computers fault. Just have to control yourself. To wrap this up I would just like to say thank you @CAPS4 having the time to read my letter. My reasons are, computers make life easier, talk to family and friends @CAPS4 free, and if you control the amount of time you use on a computer than you will be fine. Thanks again.",4,4,0
18,"Dear Local Newspaper, I must admit that the experts are centainly right cause I know people that stay on the computer all day and thatÂ’s really not good if you ask me. Instead of being on computers learning about faraway places, and talking to other people, you should go exercising, you should relax, and you should interact with family and friends. Exercising is much more better than being on a computer, and I say that to say this. When your on a computer just sitting there playing online games and checking other things out, or whatever the case @MONTH1 be, you get board, and hungry, and I know theres some snacks around you while your doing whatever your doing. Instead of being on a computer for @NUM1 or @NUM2 hours or maybe even all day getting fat. There are many ways you can exercise. You can take walks, you can go joggin, you could play a sport, I mean there are a lot of things you can do when your not on a computer. I know some people that could be workin all day and still come home to there computer. Rest is good also. You don't always have to jump on your computer, you could just relax watch a movie, eat some pop corn and just enjoy yourself, you could even take a nap for a little while or something but you don't always have to get straight on your computer if you really don't have to use it. The way I see it is family, and computers are always going to be there but at the same time which one is more important. Friends aren't always dependable so you really don't need them around only a selected few, but thats not the point. Both family, and your true friends have feelings, and if your not spending time with them over a computer that your gonna have when you leave, and come back home too something isn't right. Tomorrow isn't promised, we live for today. So enjoy life while you got the chance, and spend time doing something active, with family and friends, and if your really into computers, try to balance your time out.",4,4,0
1209,"Computers have many effects on people these days. Most of them are very good effects that can lead you to become more self-confident. Computers can educate people, from learning about some ancient person to doing school projects. Also computers entertain people too. Lastly it can even increase you chances of finding a job or helping out your job. For most people education is very important to but since kids don't stay in school @NUM1 they use the computer to teach to kids kids can learn about other places. This benefits us because we're learning something and growing out our knowledge. Also kids can do their projects. For example writing on essay, their science fair project and so on. Lastly kids can learn about people from other times. For example famous musicians long ago, celebrities, legends, hall of famers etc. People always look for some kind of entertainment and the first place they ever go is the computer. Everyone likes enetertainment and the computer in the the best plan. They could play a variety of games. Games from the past or gaems from the future. There is also a whole bunch of : multiplayer, figure, castle defense, shnaler sports, racing, acade, and so on. Another fun thing to do is interact with friends online or even talk to any family don't live near you. Lastly, you could watch funny videos, sad videos and music videos. Another that computers effect people is their of finding or help on their . the computer can teach people what they will do on their job, and what to expect. Also, it can let you search for jobs. In your. Finally, it can help them for allowing them to a web page. In conclusions computers have people. It can increase their education, give them entertainment, and even help out on their job, or help them find a job.",4,4,0
976,"Dear editor, I see that there is an argument between computers being good or bad. I think that my oppinon can help your decision. I think that computers are good. I think they are good because they help kids with social skills, they help people with bad handwriting and they help people learn about things around the world. First of all computers help kids all around the world with social skills. They help them because these is so many ways to communicate with people through the computer. There is instant messaging and webcaming websites. Also a servey said that @PERCENT1 of parents say that the computer raised there kids social skills a lot. Another thing the computer helps with is people with bad handwriting. It helps because you can go on microsoft word and instead of writeing a great report that no one can read you can type I that when I have a paper for school that neatness counts on I always up my report. This can help alot of people who cant write as well as others because on the computer you change the font and everything to make it look as nice as you want. The last reason I think the computer is a good idea is because alot of people dont like to read newspapers and watch the news so they like to research certian subjects they like, to know whats going on around who world. I know my mom doesn't have time to watch the newest the newspaper but when she checks her email the first thing that pops up is the bigest news of the day. People all around the work go so the computer to find of the latest news. I hope you consider my oppinon when you make you decison, where you go think of all the kinds of people it helps. People with social problems, people with bad handwriting, and just busy people who cant sit down and watch the hour news. Thank you for your time.",4,4,0
188,"Dear local Newspaper, Some people say computers have negative affects on family and friend others say computers are an important aspect of society. I would have to agree with the second group of people. Computers help students research information that they @MONTH1 need for school. People can talk to there friends on things like facebook or @CAPS1 and you can write a rough draft on the computer save it then go back to it and make the final changes from a draft to a final. I will elaborate in the following three paragraphs. Computers are a quick and easy way to look up information for a school project or paper. I can understand people thinking that computers take away from family time but so would a book. A book would probably take up more time and you @MONTH1 get less information. For example the book could be about multiple people and you read the entire thing only to get two sentences of information. Another reason computer reasearch is quicker is that you can go from one page get some information and then once you have gotten all the information from that page but you still need more you can just click another link. If people didn't have computers they would have to go to the library and spend time looking them. Is it worth it to use all that time. People can talk to there friends on facebook or @CAPS1. Some people say computers distract you from friends when really they help you talk to your friends more. What if your on vacation and your so tired of seeing and talking to your family because you've been with them non stop for a week and you miss your friends. All you have to do id turn on the computer and then you have an intent link to them. Chat rooms also help you meet other people your age from the next town over on enywhere in the country. They @MONTH1 even became your new best friend. When you write a paper do you want to have to write it once then go back and write it @NUM1 more times? Theres a much simpler way it's called a computer. You can write your first draft then all you have to do inordre to get a final copy is reread it and make changes when they are nessecary. Computers also help kids spell better. All they have to do is hit a button.",5,4,1
925,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I was sitting at home when I have realized this has to come to an end! The computer bissness has taken my mother and my stepfather away from me, I mean when they are on facebook they are in a whole nother galaxcey. The family spends no time together what so ever. Also, they argue, dont sleep and again, we don't spend anytime together! Not spending time with family isn't a good thing. Social activity is good for everyone. Even if the time spending is not with family, socializum is a very important rollplay in use. On the other hand arguing isn't. Arguing just decreases the social time spent. Arguing in my family causes friction to the point where we become unsocial and turn to a computer. Now if were arguing about the computer then we have a huge problem. The arguing will never end! Not sleeping is my biggest concern though, when they are up all nite on that stupid thing, oh gosh don't get me started. I believe they don't have good days during the day when in school. Actually I know they don't because they are day. Computers cause my parents to use up family time, fight, and not sleep, they spend more time on the personal computer than I'm a! @CITY1 @PERSON1, I think we have a problem. A very big one!",4,3,0
566,"Computers are not having a negative affect on society. In fac when you talk with someone online @CAPS1 helps build relationship within that person. A use for computer that is also use full is hand eye coordination. Education is also a useful thing you can use with computers. You can learn about faraway places and monuments. The myth is that computers ruin relationship between friends and family however, In some ways @CAPS1 improves them, when you go on skype you talk with some one online. By doing this you actually improve the bone between you and that person. This information proves that computers can actually suport replationships. Hand eye coordination is also something useful that a computer an teach when you type on keyboard your fingers inprove on reflectsel. If you continue to type your hand eye coordination will improve. Some people might say that a computer won't help you much @CAPS1 really is possitive to use @CAPS1. A computer is more educational than what most people would think. On certain websites you can see something that can teach you. If you go on a historian websites that someone could learn about different typs of people. Lots of critics say that a computer is not educational. However when you look at the facts a computer can teach a lot. @CAPS1 is easy to belive a computer is not a good thing. But when someone looks at the facts A computer is a great thing to own. If critics acna take these facts into consideration a computer is a better object than what most people say.",4,4,0
1262,"Dear local newspaper, Have you ever noticed how a lot of people are always on their laptop or their computer? Well, when they're on the web they don't get exercise at all. I have three seasons why people should spend less time on their computers. People could get sick, probably forget a lot of stuff, and never have the future that they have always wanted. My first reason why people should spend less time on their computer is people could get sick. For example, their are a lot of people who just eat and eat and only use their computers. Some people get obese by doing this. When they do they go on the internet to find out how to lose weight, but they never do it. Some people go on the internet so they can have a surgery because they're so fat. They think their is a cure for obese on the internet, but the truth is that the only cure their is by doing. Some exercise because that is the only cure they will get if their not on their computer. When people are surfing the web they forget a lot of stuff. Some people almost spend their whole day or even life on their computer that they don't know what else to do, but surf the web. What I have seen happen is that some people forget where they're at or who the even are. They also forget who their family is and never contact each other at all. This isn't good people. My third and final reason is no future. Sure some people apply for jobs at home from the computer, but the only problem their is that they don't get enough exercise and paid as well as the people who work outside their house. Some people wanted to do something about their life's and how they can't because they are addicted to their computers. Some people have to go to thearapy so they can stop going on the internet. Do you want that? Getting sick, loss of memory, and no good future are three reasons why people should stop using computers and start getting some exercise. If I were addicted to my pc I wouldn't get on education and I wouldn't be writing this letter right now. Get some exercise. Together we can make a change or find a cure.",4,4,0
306,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are important for growth. They teach us skills like hand-eye coordination, they allow you to talk online, and learn about faraway people and places. I do believe that it benefits society even though many people dont. Nine out of @NUM1 schools use computers on a daily basis and their community is still fine. I know you think its taking away real social time but it really is improving the community. Imagine a student playing basketball, and his teamate passes the ball to him and he can't catch it because he has no hand-eye coordination skills. That wouldnt happen to him if he spent more time on the computer. There are many coordination games on the internet, like pinball of @CAPS1, that help build that up. When you play those games you keep your hand on the mouse or keyboard and your eyes on the screen. It helps you to not look down. When you play basketball, you can catch the ball and still throw it if you have good coordination. out of @NUM1 people keep in touch with family or friends online. Its the greatest feeling when you talk to someone you haven't seen in awhile because you know that they still remember you. When you talk to people online, you get to know them better and they tell you things that they dont want others to know. Also, when you meet up with them, you have more things to talk about. What would happen if you were to go to a location that you thought was nice, but it turned out to be the worst place ever? It would be terrible, but if you looked it up on the internet, you would know the truth about it. Lets say you want to know about someone famous, you look it up on the computer. There are many educational things on the computer that can help you out in life. I do agree with you on one thing. Society is losing its communication skills. Being on the computer all the time isn't doning anyone good. Nobodys picking up the phone and calling their friends to talk. They are distancing themselves from everyone but their computer. We dont want out society to stay this way. The people who spend their day on the computer need to change. I think computers are an asset to the community. Many people believe that computers are ruining everything, but they really aren't. Computers are good for learning about people and places. The question is, do you want people to refrain from using computers? Now is the time to decide, do you want us to use computers to furter our education or not?",4,4,0
638,"Dear @CAPS1 times, I am writing in regards to the article recently writen in your newspaper on computors. I believe that they are a vital part of the world today because; you can find information for protect or article in far less time then searching through books, you can get important news updates and entertainment is only a click away. My first reason was at the information on the internet. Say you were writing a paper on acient egyptians, and you need to know how to spell hiroglipics in a dictionary that would take a few minutes, online it would take about @NUM1 seconds. Or if you wanted to know when @ORGANIZATION1 died. It would take hours scouring textbooks untill you finally found it. on time it might take your just over a minute. The second reason I like computors is for news updates. You can figure out what happened in recent natural disasters, or how your stock is doing. Also computers helped us in the recent election, and will continue do so for a long time. The weather can always be found on time web for any in the world. This is a bad thing if you're planning a trip somewhere, wich you can also do with a computor. My third and final reason is that its hard to get bored on a computor. Every where on the web are cool gamesor funny videos. On the web there are about @NUM2 gaming sites and @NUM3 sites with funny/weird/cool videos and pictures. Many other places like facebook let you share picures with your friends, family, and relatives. Or you can chat with complete strangers from around the world. So next time you need information, news, or you are just bored go on your computor, and have fun.",4,4,0

753,"Dear, local newspaper I agree with @CAPS1 that computers are not good because of different reasons such as putting a person's health in danger for not excersicing much or making people spend more time on a computer than interact with family & friends and sadly also it causes people to change there attitudes and ways of being. But if you wanna hear more than you will just have to read on. There are plenty consequences that people have for spending too much time on the computer, such as people getting addicted to watching certain things or addicted to watching certain things or simply get addicted to the computer itself. Plenty of people now a days, have to wear glasses and probably most of them have to wear them because of too much computer, and it must be really bad having to wear glasses the rest of your life. Also too much computer is bad for a person's health because they're giving more time to a computer than spending that time excercising. I believe people should spend more time interacting with family & friends because it can also make you lose your friends and/or family because your not giving them the time they need & friends and family are one of the most important things in a person's life. And last but not least. too much computer can change a person such as changing their manners, the way they speak, and there attitides. Well I've giving you reasons why I think computers are not good such as, putting health in danger, changing a person's life, and causin them to lose family & friends now is up to you the rest.",4,4,0

920,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? Well I @CAPS2. People are on the @NUM1. We need to @CAPS2 something about these computers. They are preventing people from exercising, going outside, are are just making them stay in there house all day. One reason I think we should get rid of computers is because people aren't getting there exercise. the computer, next to the @LOCATION2, is probably the number one thing that makes people fat. Kids are sometimes on the computer all day eating snacks and junkfood when they should be eating healthy fruits and vegetables. You could. Almost @CAPS2 anything on the computer that you @CAPS2 in your everyday life, that's how good technology is. The computer is the thing that gets people addicted to something. The computer has games, internet, and ways to talk to people that get then attached. A second reason is that computers just keep taking money out of your pocket. When you buy a computer most people just buy the most expensive one, because the salesman talks then into it. Most people don't know what kind of computer they are supposed to buy, so they buy the most expensive one because they think the more, the better. Also just buying the computer isn't all of it. When you download softwares, games, and moble things that all cost money. Downloading one thing can cost up to one hundred dollors. plus, most people can't afford these downloads after buying themselves a pricy computer. My third opinion is that the computer is just a complete waist of time. People spand hours on the computer doing stupid stuff, like playing games and talking to the, when they should all be outside enjoying the fresh air. Going outside is very important to your health. Next time your on the computer doing something that doesn't need to be done, go outside. Think about it, hour often @CAPS2 you go outside? My guess, not much. Now @CAPS2 you know what computers are doing to the people of the @LOCATION1? They are making people fat, not getting there exercise, eating junk food and play games all day long on this stupid piece of technology. Instead of being on the computer all day why don't you think about going air you need. Also you don't want to be waisting all of your hardworked money on a stupid piece of technology. Plus, you don't want to deal with softwares and there viruses. My advice, computers are terrible.",4,4,0

It helps the society in a good way because people don't have to look though an old Newspaper. All they have to do is click and there there reading it all and probally seeing pics and stuff of it.

1512,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I have been infromed that people don't get to talk to friends/family, enjoy nature and exercise because of computers. Well computers benefit our life. The first thing about/ computers is communication.

Just because @CAPS11 use those internet websites doesn't mean @CAPS11 can't go outside and enjoy activities. This leads to other objects called peortables. As technology advances so does our skills.

With @ORGANIZATION1 creater of the @CAPS8 @CAPS11 can use this internet/music @CAPS9 for everything. for example, I visit my grandparents and I decied to my @CAPS6 phone.

Most of use portables which goes back to my last paragraph. Exercise is big and @CAPS11 all should do it. What I'm trying to say here @CAPS11 can use computers and electronics and exercise with fun one in all. If you understand experts can agree and kids could be healthier and still communicate.",4,4,0
1264,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers do not have a positive effect on people. Thanks to computers people arnÂ’t being active as much, enjoying nature, or interacting with family and friends. One reason this is true is because people are not exercising, they're too busy playing on the computers. People are gaining weight, which is already a problem in the @LOCATION1 because of unnecissary technology. There are plenty of sports that could be done, such as soccer, baseball, football, and so many more. People seemed to manage fine without computers and were a lot more active before them. Another reason computers don't have a positive effect on people is because they don't go out and enjoy nature. People spend too much time looking up beautiful place and animals when they could easily go explore around outside! Take a walk by the forest or in a local park, even by the beach and you'll see loads of animals. Not to mention, the immense amount of different plants and flowers they have never noticed right behind their very own home! No computers and people could quickly start enjoying nature more often. Thirdly, a reason why computers arn't positive on people is because they're not interacting with other people. Some people are too busy on facebook or myspace, e-mailing or @CAPS3-ing each other. Sometimes they arn't even talking to who they believed they were, it not only dangerous but unhealthy also. Whats wrong with giving someone far away a call? You can actually hear their voice and know its them on the other line! Its rediculous how people will e-mail a friend thats down the street. It would be much simpler and healthier to just walk over to their house. The two of you can chat and take a walk, or play a game, not just sit infront of a screen the whole day. Computers make interacting with other people, in person, a lot more difficult. With computers people are not active enough, don't enjoy nature often, or interact with others as much. They simply are not a positive effect on people. You should also agree and let computers stay to perfessionals.",4,5,0

About @PERCENT1 of all picture on the internet are true. A computer can also hold pictures that you take on a digital camera. It can even take a project on a flash drive and then download it. The computer can even email the pictures to any email that exsist. If you want to go to the movies or on vacation you can get the movie tickets online. You can get them at any ticket sales website.

If there is ever a reason you can't drive to store or where ever you need to go to buy something, you can shop online and buy @CAPS4! you can just type in the adress of the website and look at all the stuff they have and click what you want and buy @CAPS4!

That's any almost everyone should use a computer.",4,4,0
1693,"Dear Newspaper, Have you notice that now a days more and more people are becoming overweight? Well its true. People say that it is because of eat a lot of fast food but I think that since we are always on the computer and not excersing helps contribute to it. Also as the technology is getting better it is keeping people from going outside and enjoying the beautiful nature. Sitting infront of the computer isn't going to help our environment. Lastly, kids aren't getting out of their house to interact with friends and family because technology has been able to let us communicate without leaving our house. @CAPS1 not saying that we should downgrade our technology, but we need to find a way limit it. To start on with, technology has a role in the increasing rate of obesity. Some @MONTH1 say that people chose not to excerise but if we limit things then they won't have to chose. As a kid myself, I love to be on the computer. My parents are always trying to get the computer and take the dogs for a walk and I always say ""@CAPS1 busy"" @CAPS2 its true, I don't really like to go outside because I have a computer to play games or talk to friends and to be honest excersing to me seems important but I don't do it because I'm always on the computer. I think that other people could feel this way so thats why we need to limit the computer. Secondly, global warming is occuring right now and people would rather be inside on the computer then go outside and enjoy the nature. @CAPS2, you @MONTH1 be able to look up ways to stop global warming, but does it mean you are going to really do it? Some @MONTH1 not because they could just stay on the computer and keep ""@CAPS3 up"" ways to help another things is that when we use our computers, we use electricity, which adds to global warming so it we limit the use of computers then people could go enjoy nature and not destroy it. Lastly, internet sites like myspace, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc have allowed us to communicate with friends and family but we are still not able to get out and interact with them. When we get out and interact with our friends we gain like communication teamwork and respect friend and family can teach you this with them the computer they can't. Also interacting with your family and friend @MONTH1 let you go in new places that you haven't been before and on the computer you can't go there. Interacting with friends & family is better than talk thru the computer. In conclusion if we stay on the computer then we won't get excerise enjoy nature or interact with friends. So we need to act now limit compute usage!",5,5,1

You @CAPS10't just assume computers are bad for us, you might be surprised. @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am going to explain to you why we need computers to do projects. Well, I @CAPS5 from personal experience, my social studies teacher always likes you to type your final draft. Also, using a computer makes your projects easier because @CAPS3 @CAPS4 fixes your mistakes, and @ORGANIZATION1 finds everything you need. I find it much more easy to use a computer for projects and I @CAPS5 all of my friends think it is also. If you aren't persuaded yet, keep reading because I @CAPS5 you will be eventually! Next @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you about making friends just with a computer. I @CAPS5 that parents these days are really happy when you have come home and made new friends. Just by using a computer you could easily go online, search friends you want to @CAPS11 to @CAPS5 better, and chat with them. (to make sure they are who you think!) The other day my friend @PERSON1 came up to me and said meet my friend @CAPS6 I met online! I was really happy for her and realized computers are helpful. Everybody needs friends that are there for them, and computers are the perfect conclusion for that! Last @CAPS2, I am going to talk to you more about why and how you could @CAPS11 @CAPS12 @CAPS13. Do you @CAPS5 what @ORGANIZATION1 is? You @CAPS10 search @CAPS7 on @ORGANIZATION1! If you really wanted to @CAPS5 something and you were really curios you could search on @ORGANIZATION1!

155,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 there has been a lot of talk about how computers effect society. Some ""experts"" say computers are good for society and some think the opposite computers are bad for society because they make children obese, decrease a person social skills, and even make children less educated. Computers are just plain bad. In recent years studies show that children that use the computer often are less likely and less willing to get active. Dr. @PERSON1 says, ""The more children use computers is the more time they waste @CAPS3 not being active at all."" A study conducted @CAPS3 the @ORGANIZATION1 shows that children that use the computer @NUM1 hours a day are more obese then children who use it one hour or less a day. Computers keep children inside all day. A child on the computer is wasting time not being active. The main reason children become fat on the computer is because it is easier to just go on the computer than to walk and exert energy. Computer are a direct cause to child obesity, and they are a threat to society. Some of you @MONTH1 think a computer can increase social skills, and you are dead wrong! On a computer you can ""talk"" to friends, but it is not like you are actually talking to them. On a computer you can talk in privite and say what ever the heck you want. In public if you say something bad you will get in a lot of trouble. A computer offers no face to face interaction. So when a person who uses a computer often is at a social gathering they are usually very awkward. My cousin spends all of his time on the computer and when I went to his on christmas he never took his eyes off the screen! Computers is destroying the social life millions of people. Did you know that people who use the computer often are usually less smart than kids who don't? ""Experts"" on computers say that computers can be used for infenite nolege. The key word in that fraise is ""can"". just because kids have knoledge at their finger tips doesn't mean the will use it. On many projects and homework assignments I have record kids say ""@CAPS2 I just copied and printed an article on google."" @CAPS3 copying and printing students don't learn anything. Computers are slowly making people less educated. Ever since the invention of the computer people have seen promise for society. Now computers are destroying society @CAPS3 making people fat, socialy weird, and less educated. So how can people still think computers are good?",5,5,1
34,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 is a rumor going around saying that computers are a negitive affect in a childs life. I disagree. A computer can help a kid in so many ways, it can help students with homework, let students talk to friends, and help with school projects. And besides, most kids don't don't stay on the computer very long anyways. Homeworks, it's a big role in school, if you don't do it or worse don't get it can you down. That's why computers have websites that help a child learn how do do a problem or a social studies question if they don't know. If you go to the school web page then theres a link that brings you in a math games. Theres even a to a science website. This helps a child so they don't get stressed out over homework. A computer also helps a students interact with friends. A social life is very important to a @NUM1 grater. This is where a computer can have aim, facebook, and even myspace help a kid impact with friends. If a kid got into a fight at school can come home and to work it out and not leave it unseatled. A computer also new friends from other towns. Teens need to and make new friesnd will helps as in life. If a teen helps with a then they can ask a for help. Every student gets a take home project at social point in the time of running out to the store to buy paper and pencils. you can stay home, have money and typee the essay. Computers can help with a social studies or a science project. You can print pictures and find information. Drawing can be a hastle and messy, so it saves time and the mess. If @CAPS1 are words you dont understandd then you can look them out. Computers are and best way to do a project. Computers, everyone uses them, they help our parents just as much as uss. They help us with homework, let us talk to friends, and even help us do our projects! Computers are one of the best technology we have @DATE1.",4,4,0
326,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are one of the most useful things that we can have. First, computers are good for communicating. Students @MONTH1 contact teachers through email if they have a question about an assignment. Computers also are useful for teaching. People use the @CAPS2 everyday to get information on their favorite sports teams or on a new recipe they saw on television. Finally, computers help us get work done easier. Student and employees use @ORGANIZATION1 for everything from writing a paper to creating a presentation. Futhermore, computers are extremely essential to our everyday life because they help us communicate, learn and finish work. Every year, thousands of students go to college, and thousands of families move away from each other. Computers are one way of communicating to @CAPS8 loved ones in far away places. Parents send messages via email to their children at college. Families speak with each other through @CAPS3. Computers are what makes all this possible. Not only can we use computers to make contact with our families,but we can also use them to speak with our teachers. Whenever a student is sick, but wants to get their homework finished, they look on their teacher's website. Here, all the homework for the class is listed. Also, if a student has a paper due the @DATE1, but their printer is broken, they @MONTH1 email the paper to the teacher. This allows the student to get full credit for their work. Email is not onlyuseful for handing in projects, but also for asking questions about the assignments. If a student has a question about an assignment, he or she can ask a friend or the teacher. Then, the student will be able to successfully complete the project. Computers are one of the most useful ways of making contact today, but communication is not the computer's only purpose. The average person goes on the @CAPS2 ten times a @DATE1 just to get information. Computers provide a pletvera of knowledge for people's use. Search engines like @ORGANIZATION3 or yahoo provide answers in less than one second. This is much faster than going in the library and spending an hour looking it up. Website text is not the anything that provides information far eager learners @CAPS5 also provide pictures to further the persons understanding about a topic. For example, if a person is living in the @LOCATION1, and has lived there all their life, but is reading an article on a website about an animal native to @LOCATION2, they would not know how to picture it in their head. Articles and books @MONTH1 provide a description, nut nothing really gives the person a solid picture. The person could go online and search for a picture, which they will surely find. Finally, computers keep the brain active. While searching on a website, a person could piece together information from different sites to create a better picture, and, therefore, have a more complete and thorough understanding. In order to do this, however, a person's brain must constantly working. This helps develop skills later on such as problem solving. Overall, computers are one of the most useful and common of the learning devices. Many people say that computers are useful. They agree this by saying that work gets done so much easier and faster on a computer. on average, computers complete work fifty times more efficiently than people do by hand. This is because of programs such as @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS8 programs allow people to cerrect spelling and grammatical mistakes while at the same time creating a neat looking presentation. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with bad spelling or grammatical habits corrected @CAPS8 mistakes quickly through @ORGANIZATION2 and @CAPS6. If people constantly make grammatical or spelling errors, then having them underlined in @CAPS6 will show them that this is not the correct way to punctuate or spell something in a sentence.",4,6,0
773,The effects of computers to people are that adults and kids are getting way more attention then they need to. The first reason why is that most spend their time social networking. The others are either buying things or playing games. Some of the people that are on the computers are wasting too much time being tech-saavy. It's other ways people can spend their time like biking or taking a brisk walk. Another solution is you can get up on you learning skills or find a job around you town. Computers drain and waste peoples minds everyday. I think it is essential for the people that can't get off seek fitness and mental health. Than again it could be legitimate reasons to be on the computers spending as much time as you want. The people that abuse the access of their computer too much should think and find something else to do. I think it'll be a good idea to have a time when the computers should be shut off one day or a week. By that I mean the cable/enternet company should turn the internet and the cable off for a week of pure exercise. That'll make people who are lazy to do something active. It'll also be a good motivator for people who are on the computer or watching t.v too much. Then it would make everybody fit and health if they try. I understand the elderly or senior citizens who need their computers for health help. That's understandable but everyone else should not be exempt. Computers and laptops should be network disconnected to make people get off their feet and do something helpful or brain building. Everyday people are being digitally sucked in. Some people in this world just can't get enough of it and it need to dead soon. The government should make a legal law that you must do something that will actively benefit you. It should be a person of the state or local towns person that goes to every house. Another way that could be done is by one person from every street in the state go home-to-home to make sure the procedure is being done. A lot of people are not going to like it and they will not obey the new law. It should be a penalty towards anyone that fails to abide by it. The second choice should be a loss of internet services. That'll make them really mad and in exchange they should still exercise. Sometimes it takes harsh laws to make somebody change.,4,4,0
1231,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I think computers have good effects on people such as letting people talkto family or friends that live faraway. Computers also let you learn about different places and people around the world. My first reason is that computers let you learn about different places and people around the world. This helps you if you are going on vacation to foreign country you can learn where the test historical sights are and you can also learn where the best hotels are. If you have a project due on a foreign country you can search it up and it will give you all the data you need about it. My second reason is that computers let you talk to family or friends that live faraway. This helps you keep in touch so it doesn't seem like you don't know them any more. Computers can also let you talk to your friends that live faraway and if you want to hangout it would let you talk about which days are good for you and them.",3,3,0

Advanced technology today allows you to do almost everything that would have been considered impossible @DATE1 decades @DATE1. We need to decide whether computers have positive or negative effect on people. I firmly believe computers gives society many benefits and opportunities. Who would disagree that computers are devoted to educational purposes? Computer experts have invented countless programs that make @ORGANIZATION1 easier for kids. For example, @CAPS1 helps you with essays and reports. With her program teachers wouldn't hurt their eyes trying to read sloppy hand written compositions from students @ORGANIZATION2 helps you organize and calculate, @ORGANIZATION3 gives you the @ORGANIZATION3 to create dynamic presentations. Many schools have a computer lab for students to complete their @ORGANIZATION1 tasks. @ORGANIZATION1 has also aquired convenient-sized laptops to help students do their projects and take test. That saves a lot of paper and a lot of trees! Furthermore, many colleges offer their courses online. You can obtain a college degree right at your house without going anywhere. Education has never been so easy, thanks to our advanced network and computers. It is very important to mention the entertainment benefits of computers. I have notices many teens play cool games on the net. They seem to greatly enjoy this opportunity. It in an ideal way to relax after a stressful way getting on the computer and listening to the newest songs. Some websites after downloadable songs for free so you don't need to worry about the financial part. Moreover you can watch movies online anytime, form wide section such as horror, romance, comedy, fantasy or even children films. No more movie tickets, no more driving in the theater. Without a doubt computers can put a single on everyone's face with its entertainment benefits. Many people feel that computers both kids and adults always from their social life, but actually, computers give them a chance to communicate with other people around the world. Ten @DATE1 @DATE1, who would have thought that they could chat and talk directly with same one a thousand miles @DATE1, with no mail or telephone or whats over? I came to the @LOCATION1 @DATE1. I am extremely grateful to computers because I can keep in touch with my friends and relatives. I can just send them pictures of the snowy winter sceneries here through just a minute. How much easier could it get? computers definitely improve communication and brings people closer. Let's not wait any longer. Computers have endless positive effects and should be popularizeas. They help you learn have fun and communicate with people faraway. Above and beyond all that new technology makes the earth a greener place by saving paper and trees. Don't sit here and wait educate people about the benefits of computers today.",5,6,1

Three main reasons are that people learn more about cultures, places, and some people work online. @CAPS1 first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about cultures around the world. Learning about cultures is very important because if people travel they need to know how they can respect each other. @CAPS1 second reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because they help you learn about places around the world the world.

526,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 to this article more and more people use computers, and the people who support advances in technology believe computers have a posotive effect on people. I disagree on you part. I believe that computers can ruin your life, and make you go blind. Firstly, computers can ruind your life if. you stay on them for too long. Computers is a little device that can almost let you do anything on it. The computer can let you look ups where your friends live, you can play tons of games ect. I remember this one time when I was watching channel @NUM1 news and a @NUM2 years kid fainted from playing a computer game for too long. See, I told you that they can ruin your life all it takes is a couple of hours to like the computer. Secondly, computers can make you go blind because the screen of the computer is too close. The computer is built so you can do things on it, but unfortunatly the screen was screwed in too close so when you have to see something on your computer you literly have to stick your face on top of the screen. I remember one time when my dad bought a @ORGANIZATION1, my dad was on that computer all day and when he got off it his eyes were blood shot, the mont after that he got glasses. See, I told you stickig you face too close to a computer screen can hurt your eyes. In conclusion, the computer can ruin your life and can make you go blind. The computer is bad for you, so you should stop and think about what I wrote in this persuasive letter.",3,4,0

If your always stareing at a computer screen all the time you can go blind. And with you having bad eyes you can get serious head injures just from hurting your eyes. The second reason why computers have a bad affects on people it is not safe if you have little kids in your home.

23,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you ever see a child on the computer for hours and nothing could get them off? Well I believe that this is very harmful for the child since it doesn't allow them to exersice, interact face to face with people or use their minds to the best of their @NUM1. The more and more we advance in society we get laziar and forget to about these essential things. I think taking a step back from using computers could benefit society more than using them. Obesity in the @LOCATION2 is at its highest @PERCENT1 of kids in the @LOCATION3 agree that they only exersice once a week and would rather spend time on the computer. Think of this, @PERCENT1 of kids. Thats more than @NUM2 of @CAPS2 children. I took the and compared it in @CAPS3 children who don't the benefit of this technology. I learned that @PERCENT1 of children there exersice only once a week. That's for less what these computers are doing to @LOCATION3 @PERCENT2 of children are overweight and @PERCENT3 of them develope heart of blood problems as adults. I by exercise in to go and play with friends or bike, or go for a jog. It doesn't sound hard does it? If we make a to spend this than on computers I think we can reduce this obesity amount and I believe @CAPS2 ran as on overall country. On the computer we have popular websites like @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and @CAPS7. More websites allow you interact with people over the island. This could be in more ways than one. These computer websites are allowing anyone to talk in people who could have the interest in mind. More than @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in my school say they have one of these accounts and have personal posted on them. With this personal info, could and with these websites the crime rate has gone up @PERCENT4. Also, these websites cause people to their social skills. People spend hours on these websites talking to people and forget how to talk face to face. @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 students say they would say something online that they wouldn't say to someone's face. This creates more problems in schools and could possibly make someone hurt someone else or themselves. I've heard all over the news about suicides and because of computers and I believe with less of them people would spend more time with their family and or nation would be closer and safer. Computers dont allow you to explore nature and use your mind to the best of its ability. Computers make it easy and I myself, think it makes me laziar because it allow me to read a book there or read about other people, instead of going to a library and getting a book. Computers take away time to actually use your mind and problem solve in real life solution. There's years and I've learned I can be on the computer for hours playing them and not realize it at all.

To me that sounds like something with a positive effect, would you say? First of all, as some people say it doesnt let you interact with family members. Yes it truely does you can interact with both friends, and family members by going to chat rooms such as aim, meebo.web cam meeting such as skype.com.

1374,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I think we should have computers for great purposes. One reason is because there is a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on many different websites. My last reason is because you can send messages to a faraway place by using e-mail. My frist reason states that there is a lot more information on the internet. For example, if youn don't have the newspaper with you, but you have you laptop, you can get information that way. Did you know, over @NUM1, @NUM2 people use their laptops for information and not games. Another example is if we get the newspaper everyday but it doesn't have the article that we are looking for, we use the internet. When we look for information on the internet, you would use yahoo, google, and other informational websites that you need. My second reason states that there is some history on many different websites. For instance, you can go on a websites and learn about history everyday, insted of going to a museum about history everyday! One day, I had to make a project about the @CAPS4 and I had four days to do it, you know what I did, I went on a historical website about the @CAPS4. I got an A+ for my project. When people need history, it's always all around them on the internet. My very last reason states that insted of texting people from faraway places, why not just use an e-mail address. For example, you don't have to pay for an e-mail address. It's actually free and did you know, more than @NUM3 million people around the world use an e-mail address insted of texting other people. When you don't have an e-mail address, it's very quick to make one. You don't have to waste money to text someone halfway around the globe. In conclusion, I think that we should have computers. One reason is that we have a lot more information on the internet. Another reason is because there is some history on some websites. And my last reason is because you can send messages to a far away place by using e-mail. Thank you for reading this article.",5,5,1

It is true that computers @MONTH1 be detrimental to a person's health, affecting the amount of exercise and interaction a person gets, but the positive effects of computers more than make up for this. People learn much of what they know from the computer. Among an infinite number of things a person can learn from them are definitions new words, scientific theories, algebraic equations, history, law, any number of languages, and much more. Computers, when used for learning, can teach people things they @MONTH1 learn in school, but on their own time, computers exercise the brain, and teach it to think beyond the bounddries of ""@NUM1."" They also teach the brain how to better direct the body to face i'ts needs. Coordination can be very hand for some people, and this can be a problem. Without coordination, people wouldn't be able to catch a ball, avoid certain dangers, or even stand. To help improve this people need practice. They can get this practice from exercise catching ball, threading a needle, or using a computer. Using the mouse on a computer can help with hand-eye coordination in that it forces the brain to direct the mouse to a certain place on the screen, in order to accomplish what is needed to be done. At first, this process @MONTH1 be excrutiatingly slow, but over time, as the brain gets practice at this coordination improves and the process speeds up @CAPS1, the person will be able to use the computer faster and more efficiently. This will help them play games, learn, or even help people when they are in need. Helping people is very important in this day an age. That's why it is important for people to find out news quickly so that they can help. Computers allow this. For example, on the day of the deadly earthquake in @LOCATION1, most of the world found out within the hour from computers. News sites broadcast its social networking sites such as @CAPS2 talked about it, and people talked to each other online about it. This rapid spread of the news saved many lives in @LOCATION1 as people immediately dropped what they were doing and rushed to help. Computers affect people in that they help to send out news and stories causing them to want to help people. Many websites also are adept at donating money while playing a game. For example, www.freenke.org is a site that donates @NUM2 grains of rice for every question answered correctly, and they have donated over @NUM3 @CAPS3 grains of rice. Obviously, computers and sites like these have to have a positive effect on the world. Overall, one would think that computers have a mostly positive effect on the world. Despite limiting exercise, they encourage learning, and the exercise of the brain. Computers also help people with their coordination, which is very important. Finally, computers promote a world where people want to help each other, and a world where people keep up with current events, whether they like it or not. Thank you, editor, for considering my side on the positive effects computers have on the world.",4,5,0
877,"Dear editor, I believe that computers are an important part of modern life and proves itself to be available because everyday. Many times we don't even think about using computers, it just becomes a part of our dayly routine. We use computers everyday in many ways, sometimes to stay intouch with a far away friend learn about and experience faraway places, or @MONTH1 be ever to practice hand eye coordination. Computers are so benifical to our life we might not be able to live without them. Most people have experienced a friend or relitive move, when this happens not all hope is lost because with the use of you run stay in touch. Many computers nowadays have built in webcams which alows you to get more than just an email. With these systems you can actualy get an image of your fried or relative. Even oprah winfrey uses the webcam feature on computers to have people ""skype"" on to her show. In adition to this there are many other ways to stay in touch even if your computer is older and have. These reletively new ""social networking series"" include facebook, twitter, and many more. Every morning when i wake up and on sportscenter i always about what famous are posting or twitter pages. This is just another great use of computers. In this economy not many people are spending thousands of to go to a beach paradise in the but with the use of computers, you can go there virtualy. Computers are great in this aspect because they alow you to learn and experience many expensive things for. For example if you wanted to learn somthing about india, you would dn't have to go to the local library and check out a book, you could just type there are many such as this that give you access information that you could ever need. This prooves also to be valable if you are studing faraway while a paper. The computer is just a great way to get information with out every having to leave your home. Hand-eye coordination is an important skill that many people lack. It alows you to throw a baseball, play videogames, or even drive car. Many computer sceptics believe that you don't benifit from using computers but a recen study done by @LOCATION1 news and report reveals that people who use computers had @PERCENT1 better hand-eye-coordination than computers users. When driving you often need to operate the car, up the radio volume, and pass out goldfish to your kids at the same time, so this could be as where improved hand-eye cordination would be handy. Hand eye coordination is an important and this skill is further developed by the use of computers. In conclusion, computers are benificial both in hand-eye coordination and in communication, as well as in geting information or a topic. Computers are one the most significant ever and are valuble in many many ways.",6,5,1
662,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 know a lot of people now a days are constintly on the computer, and many people think itÂ’s a problem. Well you should know the computer is helpful in many ways, such @CAPS1 learning, entertainment, and even weight. That is just a few out of the hundreds of different things there is to do. The computer can help you get in contact with realitives you haven't seen in a long time. Or maybe if you have been having some health problems you can go online to see what is wrong, I remember my mom has been getting really dizzy and sick, and her doctor told her everything was fine, but in wasen't. So my mom checked up what was wrong on the computer and found out she had a disease, and when she went back to the doctors they figured out she really did and her on a medicine. In my opinion the computer was on of the best inventions made. It can be used for so many things, you can also purchase items over the computer. So now I hope you agree with my opinion and support the use of computer's.",3,3,0
1378,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? Of course you @CAPS1, that's where you get all the information you need. Computers are good and everyone should have one. The computers let you learn new things and you can search anything you want to know. It also lets you communicate with your family, friends, or other people you need to communicate with. It can also let you see disasters in other countries and teach you about the world. Computers are good and benefit a lot of people in these ways. Computers can allow you to learn new things and search up anything you want to know. If you're in school and you need to @CAPS1 research, well there you go, you have a computer to help you. This is also good for jobs. Any one can use them and learn new things at the same time. It let's you @CAPS1 work, learn new things, and it's fast and easy to @CAPS1. You don't have to @CAPS1 all that hard work of looking for a book and spending so much time looking for the information you need. Computers are great and you should use it. Another great thing about them is that you can communicate with them. If you have family or friends that live far away or in another country, then you can communicate them by computers. You can easily webcam with them or e-mail. This is very easy and this way you can stay close to them. This is also good if you @CAPS1 business online. You can @CAPS1 your job and talk to the people you need to talk to. If you ever have to arrange on emergency meeting and don't have time to call the people you need to, then simply send them an e-mail and your set for the meeting the next day and so are they. This is a perfect way for communication and business. My final reason for computers is that they are perfect to learn about disasters in other countries. If you ever miss the news and you really wanted to see them, then you can go on your computer and see the news and learn new things and see what bad things have happened. Also if you live some where that isn't your home town, then you can go online and see what is going on at your hometown and visit for any special occassions. You can learn a lot of new things about other countries. Also you can learn about new places if you ever want to move to another country. You can see hotels or anything you want to if you want to go on vacation. This is a perfect way for transportation and learn new things about other places. In conclusion to all of my facts, computers are good. It lets you learn new things and @CAPS1 research. Also, it lets you communicate with family, of friends in case of emergencies. Computers are also great if you want to go on vacation or learn new things about other countries. If you have a computer, then that is great.

688,"Dear newspaper editor, With all due respect to anyone that thinks the computer doesn't benefit society, I strongly disagree. Yes, there are many people that neglect other activities to be on the comuter, and yes, the computer is an invention that a lot of people depend on, but the computer is also an invention that we can benefit from in many positive ways. For example, @CAPS1' @PERSON1, a hip-hop artist with millions of fans, wasn't able to finish high school or go to colledge because of his career. He decided to get a colledge degree, so he started to attend a colledge. He had difficulty being in colledge, however, because he was constantly being harrassed by his fans, so he started going to colledge online. That way, he was able to focus on his studies and get his degree without the harrassment. The computer also has websites on the internet that are used in schools. They help teach students in a way that they will have fun and enjoy what they're doing, giving them a better learning experience. Aside from the positive uses of the internet, the computer also contains progams that can benefit us just as well. Microsoft @CAPS2, for example is a program on the computer that is used to create @CAPS2 documents such as peoms, essays, song lyric, and even letters. You can print out these @CAPS2 documents to have a copy of your ownn to keep and show people wherever you go, but if your not finished, it can be saved on your computer. People use the computer for many things, books, movies and so one. Over the years that its been existance, its benefited us al lot. What do you think?",4,5,0

946,"According to the @ORGANIZATION1 govermant @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 spend @NUM1 hours or more on a computer a day. A study shows @CAPS1 are't getting enough exercise, aren't spending enough time with fmaily, aren't enjoying their lives. Right now people would rather be on the computer then doing other stuff.Since more people have been using the computer those people heven't enough exercise. Now @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 have gone obese since they have always been or the computers, @CAPS4 year a @CAPS6 was fit and healthy, but when a friend told him about a website within the @CAPS5 @NUM2 minutes. After @NUM1 months, the fit and healthy @CAPS6 became obese. The @CAPS6 would always have junk food when @CAPS7 was on the computer. when @DATE1 came, @CAPS7 tryed out for his school baseball team. @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 was out of shape. After that happened, @CAPS7 went to his old ways by eating healthy and exercising. Now that @CAPS6 is in shape for any sport @CAPS7 plays. Next people aren't spending enough time with their families. A lot of jobs require people to be on the computer. When that happens a person will forget whats really important to them. A couple years ago, a @CAPS6 was going to have the biggest game of his life. It was the championship game. @CAPS7 was reminding his dad about it all. When the gone was about to start, the @CAPS6 looked into the crowd for his dad. @CAPS7 didn't see him at all. The @CAPS6 was just think his dad was. after the @CAPS5, @CAPS7 looked again, but now @CAPS7 was sad. His own dad wasn't at the game. His team @CAPS4 the game. Now his dad doesn't miss a thing since @CAPS7 doesn't go on the computer as often. Finally, people aren't enjoying their lives they would rather be on a computer than doing stuff they like. One @CAPS6 used to always play basketball with his friends when @CAPS7 started to go on the computers, everything changed people would ask him to play, but @CAPS7 would say no. The computer was the only things that mattered. When the @CAPS6 tryed out for his @CAPS8 school @CAPS7 didn't make it because @CAPS7 forgot how to play. When that happened, @CAPS7 stopped using the computer and went back to basketball. now when @CAPS7 tries out., @CAPS7 makes.

1058,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positieve effect on people. They do because you can talk to others online, it allows you to get research done faster and they are much more efficent and easy to use i will further explain my reasons. First of all, computers allow you to talk to others online. Talking to others online can give you good communication skills and you can get to know different people. I always talk to my friends online. We talk to each other using webcams, instany messaging, or talking on a social site like facebook. Computers and webcams can allow you to talk to friends who have moved away or for relatives. Next, computers allow you to get research done quicker. Studies shown that @PERCENT1 of people prefer using a computer to find information for any type of paper than an enclyepdia or other book. Computers are much more efficent and easier to use than books. It can agree that computers are much more efficent and that i like to use them. If you use a computer to get research done than you can be done sooner than you know it. Finally, computers are more efficent and easy to use. If you give a person to coose from a computer or a set of encyelpedias, most people would choose the computer. Computers are so much easier to use than books. On the comuter you just type in what you are looking for in search bar a boom within a tenth of a second your results are there. Now, if you use a book or enclyelpedia it could take several minutes to find what you are looking for, and then they only give very little information, unlike a computer that can give you millions of results for one topic. This proves that computer are more efficent than books. In conclusion, i believe that computer have a posieve effect on people. I do because you can talk to people online, it allows you to get research done quicker, and computers are more efficent and easy to use. I hope you will agree with me and my thoughts about computers.",4,4,0
843,"Alot of people would disagree that computers are benefiting people. But I think that computers are exremely helpful because they are a good way to learn, they are fun to use, and it's also a goodway to talk to old friends. I know there are some people who are on computers alot more than they should but still computers are very helpful. Computers are a very good way to learn because on a computer you could easily find out whi the @CAPS1 of @LOCATION1 is. But if you didn't use a computer and you went to a library it could take hours to find the right and find were in the book it is. You could also learn about news faster without writing for it to come on the news channel. Computers are a lot beter than having to drive to a library because with just a couple as clicks you could find what you want and be done. Computers are also fun because you can play little games on the internet that could easily take up on extra @NUM1 minutes that yu might have on a work break or before school. And even some games exercise your mind like solitare its fun but hard. But there are some games that people tend to over do because they go addicted. But most people haven't ever prayed a game like that or only play once in a while. Lastly computers are a good way to stay in touch with old friends because there are a lot of ways to talk to people online like say if when you were in high school your best friends moved away you sould still talk to people on a chat room were you can text. or a video chat were you actualy see them face to face.

They are good sources of information, its a good way to talk with your friends and it gives you information about places that you might not know about. Primarily, I would like to say that computer are a fantastic source of information. They can tell you anything!

1269,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that several people are concerned with the technology boom and computer overuse.

Furthermore, we spend less and less time exercising outside because we are trapped in a technology revolution filled with inaccurate information. Why are we hurting ourselves instead of helping? @CAPS2 is very clear that our teens are growing up with no communication skills.

The valuable time of getting daily exercise is reduced, you will not see your family enough and some of the costs are outrageous! Owning a computer is surely not a good idea. is sitting around all day your idea of a workout? Having a computer would be very bad for your physical lifestyle.

I only thought of this system @NUM2 months ago and I have already my own muscles, and I can do @NUM3 pull as at a time but when I started I struggled to do @NUM2.

Ive gone countless time to find for an essay with the limited textbooks have just isnt what you need. My country project @DATE1 year couldn't have had more than @CAPS5 pleces of information from a book! It also makes a great teacher of about any subject as well.

For example, you can communicate with people, conduct business, and you can use it to learn. A computer is a big need in today's growing technological advances. Communication is not as easy to do by phone anymore because people are always busy and on the computer. You can use computers to meet people from different countries.

A lot of business transactions and presentations are done out on a computer for maximum efficiency. Computers allow us to conduct business with foreign countries without having to go there. Computers are a huge advancement in business. Computers help us learn a lot about, just about, everything. Search engines let us type in keywords and find multiple websites on that topic. Computers let us research so we get correct information with just a click. This research can be used to write essays in school. Computers help us to learn in school and outside of it. A computer is a huge technological advancement with many uses. It @MONTH1 have a few down-sides, but it has many more up-sides. Computers allow you to communicate, conduct business, and learn. Life would be much slower without a computer to speed things up.",4,4,0

You can use @ORGANIZATION2 word to make documents and powerpoint presentations that organize your ideas. Also you can use @ORGANIZATION2 excel to manage your finances! Windows movie maker allow you to contruct your own movies ifl you own a camera. Besides the obvious most helpful features, you can play computer games, watch mores and listen to music on a computer. Like anything, computers have downsides too. Some are small and some can be very big. computers are expensive. You can't see who's really talking to you on a computer. Also, many people have important information on a computer. Peoples computers have been infected and information has been stolen leaving people helpless. Bugs can also seriously damage your computer rendering it imposible to use. Many people can be smeared on the internet as well. Hate sites that encourage terrorism, racial violence and drug use are all over the web. You have to be careful where you go when using the internet. Also, sometimes computers can take over peoples lives. People spend too much time on facebook and not enough time reading or keepng in touch with family. Computers can be great things. Between their great features allowing you to be informed all the time and programs that or be great for managing buisness, it's no wonder almost every @CAPS1 household has one. Many people don't like computers. They say that the cons outweigh the pros. I disagree. Yes, the cons can be annoying & sometimes serious. But if your smart enough to stay away from @CAPS2-@CAPS3, install anti-virus software, and never give away your information to an unamed surce, the pros outweigh the cons. So overall, if your smart enough, a computer can be a fun, convienent edition to your life allowing you to do more than you ever imagined.",4,5,0
330,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I understand that there is a big discussion going on about if computers have a possitive effect on people. I believe that computers do not have a possitive effect on people because children on the computers are not safe, they are spending too much time on the computer, and the programs and internet for the computer cost too much money. First, computers have a negative effect on people, including chicken, because computers are not safe. With all this @ORGANIZATION1 technology, child predators can go onto facebook or another website and find out everything about you. This has happend to many people. Some predator went onto my friend @PERSON2's facebook page and found out his birthday, where he lived, and what school he went to. Thiss guy sent @PERSON2 a threat saying that something going to happen to him. Luckily, with the help of police, they were able to find this guy and arrest him before he got to @PERSON2. These days, this is happening all the time. More than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 give all of their information away about it on these websites and child predators have looked at them. @PERSON1 states that ""@CAPS1 this @ORGANIZATION1 technology has helped, but the negativity if has had on society but @DR1 the good the computer is doing."" @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want @CAPS3 to get taken by these child predators who know everything they need to know because of the computer? Another reason why computers have had a negative effect on people is because @CAPS3 are spending too much time on the computer and not enough time doing homework and exercising outside. These @ORGANIZATION1 websites that gives @CAPS3 the ability to talk with friends and play games have made @CAPS3 lazy and addicted to the computer. My friend, when he was little, would play outside for hours and hours at a time. He would play all different kinds of sports with his neighbor. Now @PERSON3 is older and all he does is sit on the computer until his parents have to force him off of the computer for dinner time. @PERSON3's grades have dropped tremendously and he has gotten very chubby compared to what he used to look like. Statistics show that more than @PERCENT2 of @CAPS3 have gained weight due to not exercising and their grades have dropped @NUM1 on @NUM2 grading scale. Dr. @DR1 Much says that, ""@CAPS3 have forgotten the fun in playing outside and lost the determination they had to do well in school. This is all because of these @ORGANIZATION1 computers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 now can go to any website do anything on that website."" @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1, do you want your @CAPS3 to gain weight and stop doing well in school? Lastly, computers have had negative effect on society because of money. Many families have spent thousands thousands of dollars on buying the computers and @CAPS1 them fixed. These @ORGANIZATION1 computers are crazy expensive. They range from @MONEY3@NUM3 for a @CAPS4 computer. Then each family had to buy the software and programs to go with the computer. A close family friend of ours just bought a computers. They bought a @CAPS5 that costs @MONEY2, on top of that, they spent @MONEY3 on all the programs they needed for the computer. This family cannot afford this computers but they think that they need one. @CAPS2 they have gone to the college fund for money. Now their kid has to go to a cheap school @CAPS2 their family won't go. Statistics show thas @PERCENT3 of families have waste their college money in computers because the family thinks they need a computer. Dr. @DR2 @CAPS6, ""families do not need computers, yet they waste their college money on them. @CAPS2 @ORGANIZATION1 do you think that money from a college fund is worth a computer? Computers are not worth @CAPS1 your children at.",6,5,1
172,Dear @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I do agree that people should stop spending most of thier day on the computer and start to exercise more or spend time with friends and family. The computer has the ability to let you learn about faraway places but instead of sitting behind a desk and learning about somewhere faraway you should go outside and see it for yourself. Also our country is one of the top @NUM1 that has fat people and I believe that the computer has something to do with this because most of the kids in our school have a facebook and about @PERCENT1 of those kids are on facebook for at least an hour. This is why people should stop using the internet for most of their day because they are not getting the exercise they need that is why our country is one of the top @NUM1 in the world that has most fast people. The internet does allow you to chat with family and friends but you still need to hand out with your friends outside so you can exercise by playing sports or just going for a walk down the block if you don't you will not have a healthy relationship because someitmes they @MONTH1 not even be on the computer so you can chat with them online. Also if you don't go outside and enjoy nature and play with friends then you will become very lazy just by sitting in a chair all day and you would'nt care to do anything anymore.,4,4,0

For instance, say @CAPS1 you wanted to talk to a friend in @LOCATION1, all you have to do is go on a social networking site and talk with them. Also, @CAPS1 you have relatives who live across the country, you could use webcam to talk with them. When you can talk to people from around the world. You can learn alot more about other countries culture and other cities way of life. Finally, @CAPS1 a relative is away, you can still talk to your uncle or grandma, the relationship just gets better. The internet and computers are a wealth of information. With all of the search engines on the internet you can findout how tall a maple tree is or , how to lose weight. Others @MONTH1 say that sitting down and not moving while learning is bad, but you could search about family activities nature walks and new and exciting excersises. When students need information on a school project, they can go on and search it instead of going over to the library. As a result of the internet, people are smarter. Because of the internet there is basically no more boredom. Kids and adults alike are not bored. Boredom is bad, because kids will do anything to stop it.

Computers are amazing advancement and this is why you should use one. Who doesn't like computers? They are easy to learn how to use and are in a variety of forms. Almost every college student has a computer or laptop. They could have never used one before, but then they learned how easy it was. Most computers come already installed with the necessary programs including: @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or some form of @CAPS2, a virus protection software, and other simple software. Moving is very hard, you leave a place where you have so many friends to a place that is so new to you. Computers make this so much easier by letting you connect with them without having to wait for the mail by writing letters. There is email, facebook, and myspace that let you chat with old friends, new friends, or even parents. Some people say that these things are dangerous, that is only if you start talking to people you don't know. People keep coming up with even more ways to stay connected so don't miss out on the opportunity. These people are so smart, they figured out a way to have school online. This is very helpful to somebody who is injured or is trying to get another degree to get a better job. People get assignments to do and each class only takes about one or two months. People get to do their job or enjoy nature still because their day is open and not busy. Sure people don't get to enjoy the campus, but with the price of gasoline these days, it's worth it. So don't be the person sitting around doing nothing, buy a computer and stay in touch with technology.

Three reason for this are, kids don't get any exercise people are doing innapropirate things on them, and they could lead to giving out too much info, which could lead to injury or death. The first reason is that for the amount of time that someone uses a computer, they could be outside enjoying the nice weather well, if it is a nice day of course! I mean you have to agree with me on this one, the main reasons why people are becoming obese because of some kind of technology computers. The second reason why computers are a bad thing is because some people are doing innapropriate thing on them. If people are doing such innapropriate things on them why don't the makers of the computers block them? I don't know, I mean what kind of sicko would put those sites up even? From what I have learned in computer class, they can be used for more innapropriate things than I ever even knew of! The @CAPS1 and final reason why computer technology could be a bad thing is because some people have given too much info away on them and have gotten injured by internet world @MONTH1 look like fun and games untill someone gets hurts, well thats what my mom says!

Things like chating to people across the sea without having to pay for @CAPS1 or even be there. Looking up ways to burn fat fast and diet programs. Uploading photos to share with other family and friends. And much, much more. Computers have helped so many people do so many things! Mostly good things by the way. Secondly, computers have helped us acomplish things that otherwise we couldn't have gotten done. Like go to the moon! Have cellphones! And some diseses were helped cured by using computers. Computers can be a little danguras to some people, who probley don't know how to use them right, but in a few more years all that can be fixed!

840,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers do have a positive effect on people. I agree, because being on the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, helps people learn about faraway places and people, and allows people to talk to other people. By being on the computer it helps teach people hand-eye coordination. So the computer help with hand- eye coordination by using the mouse and keyboard. For example, when you use a computer you dont need to look at your hands while you use the mouse. That helps with hand-eye coordination, because you can see where your hand is without looking. Another example is the keyboard, because while learning where all the keys are you memorize them. Then soon you can type with without looking. The computer also helps you to learn. When you go on the computer the thing people go on is the internet. On the internet people can find information about faraway places or people. So, because the computer has different links and websites, it helps kids and adults everywhere to get information fast. Without the computer everyone would have to go to a library, but what if they didnt have the right information? Then you would need to trace around everywhere to find a book. Thats why a computer is handy. Also, the computer allows people to stay in touch with others farther away. One example of this is that there are chat rooms or groups people can join. So, if a relative or friend is farther away from a more or if they are down the street, with chat rooms it makes talking easier. Also, by these chat rooms and groups it makes a lot of people happy knowing that they can still talk with an old friend or relative instead of loosing them from never seeing or talking to them. That is just another example why the computer has a positive effect. So, with the examples of the computer helping teach hand-eye coordination, makes obtaining information easier and of the many reasons and examples of the computer having a positive effect.",4,4,0

I totally agree with this. But some people don't like the computer because they spend more time on it then going outside. Here are ny thoughts on the computer. First of all, teh computer is a great way to look up the news. You can find more news and weather faster then you can on teh television. if you want to find the news, just got to awebsite that you think has news.

918,"To who this @MONTH1 concern, In my opinion, computers have greatly improved our lives. Therefore I believe that owning and using a computer is for the greater good. Three reasons that support my decision are that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily, they allow us to connect with people in far away places, and they help us to learn more about life and the planet we live on. Please consider my reasons when making your decision. My first reason is that computers have given us the ability to find information quickly and easily. This in turn allows us to get more done. For example lets say that your doing a report on @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You could run out to the library and look through hundreds of books and newspapers or you could just sit down at your at your computer, open up a web browser, and type a ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2"" into the search box. Within a few seconds you will have searched hundreds more libraries newspapers and even other computers to find information on your topic. You can also look for information on videos. Old newscasts, inteveiws, documeteries, you name it. It's all there right at your fingertips. My second reason is that it allows people in far away places to connect. If I said that to my mom she would probably tell me to go use the phone, but computers can do everyhing a phone can do and more. You ca share photos, videos, games, just about anything. Recently, I joined facebook and I now can talk to people I haven't seen in years who moved away I was born. Over the @DATE1 I had gone to my @CAPS3. My dad introduced me to his uncle who shared the same name as me. Then about month's later I got a friend request from a @CAPS4 who up in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION4, which is far from where I live, and now lives in. After talking to him for a while I learned that he was, the son of mydaduncle. If it weren't for my computer I would have never met him. Also,I recently learned and am getting pretty good. So one day my friends look me through a which has all it,. We began video taping a posting. So the computer has also allowed us to what without them having to be there. My third and final reason is that the computer allows us learn how to improve our lives and the planet we live on. Many people say that if you on the computer all the time you'll become fat and lazy,but that isn't always the case. I have actually been able to improve my exercise rutine byuseing the computer. Whenever I go out for a run, I can come home and find out exactly how far I ran, how many calories I burned, and anything else I want to know. I have also been able to find new more effective excersizes that allow me to target different muscles. Now lets talk about what we can learn about our planet. We can use a computer to find weather patters which allows us to plan our days accordingly. We can also use it to learn about news happening around the world. For example, the day of the earthquake in @LOCATION2, I opened up in my homepage and there it was and I was able to learn about what had happened. Finally a computer allows us to learn different cultures around the world. We can learn about how ancient egiptions lived, how the people in @LOCATION3 or @CAPS5 make money or how they construct their houses. All the things we would never know if we didn't have a computer. In conclusion, computers have improved the lives of the human race by a great deal. They have allowed us and how to improve our lives. I hope that this letter has helped you come to a decision about the effects a computer has on people lives.",5,5,1
261,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe many people spend to much time on computers. It is okay to be on a computer for twenty minutes, to a half an hour. But one hour or more, is too long. People could get sucked in by playing adicting games. Also by online chatting survices like facebook, myspace, instant messaging, and more. Another way, I think someone could spend more time on a computer is working on a report. They might start it lost minute. These are just same of the many ways someone could be sucked into their computers. Have you ever hopped on the computer and played a game? Then you look at the time and its an hour later? Games are very adicting. you can play a game for hours and not notice how much time has passed by. Games are very fun, but they fry your brain. @PERCENT1 of the human population spends up to an average of two hours on a computer each day. I think, we should eliminate some games off the internent, so people can spend days exercising and hanging out with friends, not playing silly games. Have you ever started a conversation with someone and realized you have been talking for an hour and a half? And that you have homework? @PERCENT3 of teenages on average spend three hours each day chatting with friends on the internent. Facebook, myspace, instant messaging are all examples of this. It is okay for someone to talk to their friends, but you need to watch the time so you do not get carryied away. I think, we shoud cut down out use on these websites, so children and teenagers can get their homework done. Have you ever been assigned a report and wait till the last minute to get it started? Many teenagers do this. They wait and start their reports the day before their reports are due. They then, are stuck on the internent for hours trying to get it done. Which makes their grade lower then if they were to start it earlyier. @PERCENT2 of students wait till last minute to do their reports, on average, they spend over four hours on the computer. I think we should make sure that students start their report earlyier so it could bring up their grades. In conclusion i believe people have spent way to much time using computers, due to games, internent chatting, and reports being done last minute. I think if we elimate games off the internent, cut down use on internent chatting, and start reports earlyier, people will start exercising, hanging out with friends and family, get homework done and get higher grades.",4,5,0
1097,"Dear fellow citizens, @CAPS1 think if you had to get a book for every question you had. That would take a long time to even get the book let alone read it. Computers have helped the modern world with questions, long distance friends, and entertainment. Computers have helped us with more then those things the @CAPS2 is sucha universal thing that its hard to come up with all of the helpful things it does. For one the @CAPS2 helps us stay in contact with our friends that are far away without talking on the phone with them. Sites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 allow us to communicate and/or play with them. @CAPS1 think is the only way to talk with a friend from a different place would be to pick up the phone and call them well your friendship would disappear very quickly. This would happen because no one ever usualy has the time to pick up the phone and talk to the person and do nothing else. Well when you talk to them on the @CAPS2 you can do other things. For example if I wanted to I could talk to someone and the @CAPS2 and clean my room. Further more computers allow us to play games or watch funny videos or any else that is entertaining. On the to do I when my brother would let me use the play again. I was but them I @CAPS1 went better A also play movies, @CAPS5 shows videos. If you ever miss a show to watched home of the show and watch it. This could save someone time and effort. Lastly, The computers much more efficient is looking yet things. IT is much faster then looking through the library and you don't have leave your I although people say that the @CAPS2 is taking away time from reading well it really isn't it. For everything you want you can read online or if you really want to you can have the @CAPS2 don't for you. Reading isn't a problem at all. @NUM1 of america believes that computers help greatly and how they have more time to do things is being upgraded every day and it keeps getting better and better. In conclusion I believe that computers are helping us and is not a bad thing. Computers are great for us and good for bussy people. Now go and get a @CAPS2 to.",5,5,1

The computer that he thought uses helping him wasnÂ’t any help at all. His health issues started to get worse. He soon started to be out of breath more always have a high blood pressure and he started to become overweight. Since he had this computer he didn't exercise or got out to spend time with his family and friends as much as he was on the internet. Computers aren't helpful, my opinion is that all they is waste time, lose your education and can make you unhealthy. As you @MONTH1 already know computer can do a lot to help you but there are some things that you don't know about computers. According to a health magazine, tests shows that using a computer for two or three hours can make you lose @PERCENT1of your brain cells. That's a lot of brain cells to lose when you are going to need them for your education. There is no way to get those back, either.

640,"Dear, I strongly believe that computers are great. There are a-lot of great things you can do on the computers. A-lot of people are saying that computers have bad effects on people, like not getting enough exercise and spending time with your family. I do not agree with that because say you have family in a different town, city, or state. There is a website where you can webcam people from all over world with anybody, so that is a good opportunity and also it is free and you can do it at anytime and if you have a laptop, anywhere! My next reason is that you get to see places you have never seen before with direct pictures, like on commercials when our familly wants to go on vaction to a far place and you know nothing about it. You can go on the computer and look up the place and see what it is about and also see what other people said about. Like if it is really hot, or cold, is it a good experience for kids, anything you want, the computer has it. My last reason on why computers are good is because of studying, one thing that always happens is I leave my textbook home. I can go on the computer and see what we had to do. Also you can use the computer to study and learn easier ways to do something for any subject. SurveyÂ’s shows that @PERCENT1 of the kids who study on the computer pass there test and get a higher grade percentage +@NUM1. Also if a kid is studying and dosent know what a word is they can I look it up and figure out the definition and how to use it in a sentence.

1252,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1. My name is @PERSON1. I have written in response to the letter sent to me on the topic of electronics. Computers, to be percise. To me, computers are helpful, yet extremely vile. These chunks of metal are expensive, unhealthy and degrading human learning capabilities. Computers have too many negaive features for me to cope with. Dell, @ORGANIZATION1, and so many other computer companies sell computers at ridiculously expensive prices. You buy one on sale and when you need your computer, @CAPS2!, malfunctions and problems assalt you. Now you have to call a repair man who will charge you even more money! Did you really spend your hard earned cash on a faulty hunk of trash? This is ridiculous. I went onto my computer yesterday and what do you think happened? It crashed! My six hundred dollar computer crashed! Computers are too expensive to have to keep. When I get rid of mine, I'm not getting another. Have you ever sat at your computer so long your eyes watered? Horrible to endure, that's not the only problem your computer can cause. Your health is at stake! When you sit at your computer working or playing instead of going out for a jog or exercise, your health degrades. Gaining weight, pink eye from staring at the screen, do I have to go on!? The very computer you @MONTH1 love can harm you. I say, get rid of that computer. Visit friends, family and aquaintances. Be active and stay healthy. Not for me, but for you. The next point I am about to say @MONTH1 shock, surprise, or scare you. Your computer is making you stupid. I can't say it nicely. Don't call me rude because it's true. I'll give you an example. A student receives a classic home work assignment. Define these three or four words. Easy right? Wrong, I'm afraid @NUM1 out of @NUM2 kids surveyed go home and use computers to retrieve the answers to homework. What if your child is cheating? What will happen to then? They could drop out of school early and live their lives as people who can't learn for themselves. Is that the world we want for kids? No! We should destroy the computers.

1685,"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that computers do not benefit society. I believe this beacause when the computer you spend less time exercising. Secondly computers make time enjoying nature. Finally interacting with family and friends is important when on the computer you don't do much of that. Plese read on to find out what i have to say about computers. Using a computer has a of down falls but @CAPS1 of which is the lack of exerizing while on the computer. As you @MONTH1 know that many countrys are becoming obese because the lack of exersize. Computers are no help to this problem. The only exersize computer contribute is the hand and fingers but even that is bad because if you are typing and on computer for too long you will get carpeltunlye in the fingers and hands. @PERSON1, an expert on health, said ""@CAPS1 in three people go on the computer for more than @CAPS1 hour a day, which could lead to obesinty. This leads to my next paragraph. When on the computer there is no enjoying the outdoors. Enjoying nature is important to every man or women's scegule. On a computer its imposible to enjoy nature because all the computer is is a time consuming brain washing thing to do. Nature helps save the brain. Without that then you'll be very exausted all the time. Did you know @PERCENT1 of kids go outside every day that means @PERCENT2 of kids are in side on the computer. This leads to my finally topic. The computer @MONTH1 have sites where you can talk to friends but that is no where as good as seeing them in person. Your family is important so you need to spend time with them. My family always does stuff together like board games and what not. With computers there would not be any time with your family because everybody will be on the computer playing games insted of spending time with you family. In my conlusion computer have extraordinary bad affect on society because it exausts time for exersicing, also limits time to enjoy nature and finally people spent too time on computers and too little time interacting with family and friends, thank you for reading my paragraph on the many affects of computers",4,4,0
1611,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are very important to some people. Everyone uses them or has used them before. It isn't bad to own a computer because you can still excersise and be able to do the things you do everyday. Lets say that you need to look something up, the thing you always go to for information is a computer. People in schools, industries, and in homes use it all the time. Teenagers will usually go on the computer to talk to friends or maybe play games, I know I do. It's so they don't waste their time being bored all day. Excersising and being active is indeed very good for teenagers to really look into, but even though they do that, they don't push away the computer. It will always be there when they don't have anymore homework or when they finish running around the neighborhood with their friends. I can't imagine what my life would be like coming home from soccer practice and done with my homework and the computer or @CAPS1 is one of the first places I run to so I can just sit back and relax. Computers should be known as our friends. They won't hurt us. They just give us what we need and want. Reaserch is a good example because everyone uses the computer to find whatever it is that people are looking for on it. And if they're done with reaserching they can have a little fun by games and friends. But I believe that the main purpose for computers is information. Whenever I get home from school, I finish my homework and stretch a little for cheerleading then whatch @CAPS1 or go on the computer so i'm not bored. It's not that i'm not active because I'm not working out or excersising. It's because I have nothing to do, so why not make my time occupied? Everyone does it so I'm not the only one. Yes, computers are just this square box with a keyboard, but if you don't push it away from peoples common lives than you can see that they aren't what you say they are and they won't rot peoples brain or anything. The reason they are in an office or living room or bedroom is because people like them and uses them for their needs.",4,4,0
842,"@CAPS1. The computer is a wonderful thing! However the effects it has on people can be bad. Think of it this way, it has magnetic forces that pull people to it and keep them @CAPS3 for hours.

Talking over the computer is great!"" says @PERSON1, ""But actually seeing my family and talking talking to them is way better."" @CAPS6, @CAPS7, @CAPS8, and way more sights websites can put you in cyber danger!

Cyber bullying is @CAPS4 you get bullyed or are bullying another person over the computer. Don't think that no one will know @CAPS3 are ways to track down coversations between people.

151,"Dear local newspaper I donÂ’t agree with the people who say people spend to much time on their computers. Because people can lean mostly anything they want all of a computer also there are lots of resomes why people should use advances technology they can teach kids how to find out answers to there homework the fastway instead of reading a book or taken a class and still get the full understeading. The people that say others spend's to much time on there computers are also right about that but they still can interact with friends and family they can play games, speak to each other, even learn new things together, all through a computer. One thing they were right about was to go out and enjoy the nature you cant do that on a computer but you can help the nature on a computer like try to put up a blog. Something that people make so others can see and spred the word and on that blog it can stay stop cuting down trees for stores or stop killing animales for there far or anythin you wont to write.

They are teaching our family apart."" @CAPS1 one @LOCATION1 man on her two tennage children's computer obsession. ""I swear they're on that thing for hours on end"" she claims. In an artical I was reading the other day it said that most people who suffer depression admitted to being online for atleast @NUM1 hours per day. What does all of this go to show? Computers are abuse take them out of your child's life, or atleast limit them. Studies prove that @PERCENT1 of people who spend most of their day surfing the web have either over-weight or just on the boarderline of being over-wright. Rather than going into the real world and experiencing life for themselves, they look it up online and rely on other people's opinions. Does this mean anything to you? People who are overweight have a higher risk of aging, and if not, then they have some pretty health problems. All because they didn't want to breath like. When in a library environment people tend to be more and more on task. You @MONTH1 ask yourself the answer is simply that the is too expansive and distracting. If you are in the library you can't get in as much trouble, you can't play online games, or even be looking at things that are innappropriate. Libraries hae more credible sources and reliable information to study from. Not to mention you can go with a family, friend of even be tutored. Computers dont provide that. Going to the library is such a better solution. I must admit, I was before a computer addict, and believe me the effects it has on people are atracious. Now that I've moved on from that period of my life I can honestly say, the addictive grasp it has on you is strong I know. I also know first hand the rewards of being clean from this harmful drug per say. I am more sociable than ever and im dealing with issues much better.

There is one thing about the computer that is amazing. That is socilizing with friends, family or even strangers. You know when your parents say never talk to strangers well, you can do this saftely and harmless over the computer, and you also learn alot about life or other peoples life outside your small little town. There is another @CAPS1 perk with computers and that is keeping in touch with family or friends that live far away. My sister went to @LOCATION1 for six months, but the thing was it felt like two weeks because I was able to communicate and se pictures of here @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The last but probably the most important part is getting ahold of. People you actually really need talk to, such as friends, teachers or even people you never talk to in school. With these three advanced ways to soliaze it will always feel like your never alone which an awsome thing. There is many other things the computer is used for other than social life, and that is actuall important use, stuff you need to know or want to find out. Here is one example, everone has forgot there work at school or your office at least once in your life. Well with being able to just grab all the papers off line is easy. Just go to your teachers home page and just print your homework. Its that easy just one click and that saved you a twenty minuet ride to school. How about when your up at night wondering what the weather is going to be lik, many sunny, cold or even a glorious snow day. Well instead of waiting to find out you can just go on weather.com and see everything maps, forecast or what is going to happen hour by hour. Just like weather people always want to know breaking news. Why watch an two hour show when you can just get to the point off whats happening in this world we live in. I mean the parents have to open there eyes and seethis a buetiful thing. We should be proud of the fact that humans have created somthing so complex and intresting. There is one more topic that I know youre going to absoltly love. I mean right now your grading this in your office, well you can be grading this at home on your comfortble couch, with a fire crackling and all the peace and quiet in the worl. People work from home all the time. you can run a business from your very own living room. My father owns company and works from home most days. Its absoutly @CAPS1 be is able to take me out, spend time with the family and most importantly doing the things he loves and guess what, you can do this too. Like I keep saying its only a click away here is another topic, online banking. Do you really want to drive to the bank and sit down with that borring acountant and spend hours there, well, now you don't have to waste your time, you can type in a couple keys and boom, your on your way to see your information. That was faster then two hours i'm guessing. Yes, I believe that computers are a @CAPS1 use of time and will also help alot in the future.

898,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have affect on people because firstly, it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. Secondly, it allows people to talk online with friends. Thirdly, gives online games to little kids. Lastly you can wacth video's that can teach you all sorts of exotic things. My first reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives people the ability to learn from faraway places. For example if I want to go to @LOCATION4 for the @DATE1 and I know nothing about the place I can go online and look up I can look up their foods, their culture, their villages, and even there landscapes. Also the computer is good for book reports if your teacher told you to do a book report on @LOCATION5 instead of going in your text books, goion line you can look up their culture, there food, there location, how is there economy like, what kinds of school the kids go to what kinds of festivals they have etc. My second reason computers have affect on people is because it allows people to talk online with other people whenever they want. For example there are @NUM1 things that let you talk on the computer and that is @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 these two allows you to talk to friends that live faraway from you, my friend lives in @LOCATION1 and I live in @LOCATION2 we don't have cellphones so we go online to eiether @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 ""isn't that great""!!. The computer also allows you to talk from faraway places like if you live in @LOCATION3 you can talk to somebody else in @LOCATION6. My third reason I think computers have affect on people is it gives online games to little kids. For example when I say games I mean educational games like reading games, math games, writing games, etc. Statistic say the @PERCENT2 to @PERCENT1 of kids learn more things on the computer than they learn in school that a huge percentage even for kids. Also when kids play computer games it more fun to them then sitting in class all day like my litt ",4,4,0

Since. new technology, and post pictures on websites where everyone can see. Also they have games for computers that people get hooked on. Lastly, there are predator online. The new technology is amazing, like webcams where you can video chat or cellphones where you could take pictures, @CAPS1 they do have negative effects. There have been many suicides over cyber bullying. This is where people bully kids over the internet. Also some people send naked pictures online or even while webcamming. this is illegal and absurd that young or even older people would be doing these actions. Also there are websites where people can post these pictures of you that are very personal and make a huge difference in you life. There are many people who have games for their computer or download games off of websites. Most people actually get addicted to the game, They would play it all day if they could and if they arent playing they are wishing they could. This makes them miss out on alot of things. They might not get enough excersise or not do any homework which will make you grades drop. They could also not be spending time with family. It also might change who you are as a person. The most important thing about the use of computers is your safety. There are predator all over the internet and can pretend they are someone from school and ask where you live. You should never tell anyone where you live or your full name online. They can and most likely will come to your house for you. It could most likely cost you or even family members your lives. Computers can be fun and you can learn an abundant amount of information but as long as you smart about using it.

154,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that computers are an extremely useful tool in society. It helps people learn new things about different cultures. Also, it lets you communicate with friends and family through the internet, for example, using facebook or @CAPS1. Finally, it provides an accurate research tool for school projects, or interviews. First, learning about different cultures helps the world stay together. For example, here, we learn @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Each class teaches us to respect more and more of this culture. However, some people don't have the chance to get this land of education, so they turn to the internet. If the computer didn't exist, we might not know about the lifestyle @NUM1 mi away from us. We wouldn't know if their lifestyles are extremely difficult or luxurious. Also, we wouldn't know if we could help them or not. For example, the earthquake in @LOCATION1 which. It's one step closer to world peace no more war or conflicts. Secondly, the computer helps you communicate to friends and family for in the world. I remember one time I was mailing my family friends who was in @LOCATION2, risking his life. I knew he couldn't come back to town, so I started to email him, and video chat with him. Whenever I saw his face, I knew that everything was okay. I don't know how I would have without the internet. Other ways lived you could as. Also, just communicating with friends! internet sites, like extremely useful. Finally, you use the computer for educational use. For example, research projects, study tools and essays. Whenever that a research is the internet. This extremely reliable and accurate. However that some of the websites are fake, which is easy to great research to use for school projects. Also, I know many teachers in my school have a blog or page where they put their @CAPS4 on, study links, and handouts, just in case we lose them. Whenever there is a test coming up, my @CAPS2 teacher, @CAPS5 would have links on her go to help use study. Also, is another website that helps us study for vocab. It also has many games that and learn our vocab words. As you can see, the computer helps us in our daily use and makes a positive impact on our society. From educational purposes, to learning cultures and socializing with friends it helps us get through life. As very successful newspaper and people, I assume you will understand how much the computer has made a positive effect in society.",6,6,1
42,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3: Computers have a negitive affect on people and their to connect with others because they always are on the computer and never outside. My first reason is that computers hurt your eyes after a long time sitting at them. People I know have complained of their eyes hurting after using the computer. Studys show taht @PERCENT1 of all people who use the computer after a long time are more likly to loose their eye sight than people who are outside all day. Another one of my reasons is people who are inside on electronics all day are less likly to have good people skills. If you don't have good people skills then you probibly wont have alot of friends and if you need them it would probibly be over the computer. And you never know what they could be like. Also if your inside all day then you will not get the proper excersize could be very bad you and others. My third and final reason is that people will makes fun of you if you sit inside all day don't come out because your on the computer. If you ar on the computer you are more likly to fail in school you don't do your homework or projects but instead your on the computer playing games. And your more likly to get into fights with your parents or guardians because your on the computer and they never see you or hear from you. Also they wont be able to go online and pay their bills witch could be bad for everyone. So these are just some of the reasons I think computers could be bad. Thank you.,4,4,0
1087,"You say that computers are bad on todays society? @CAPS1 I'm here to prove you wrong and tell you that they can actually benefit todays society. Maybe some kids don't have phones, so they can go log onto facebook and do everything a phone has to offer and more. School. School. School; so many homework assignments and projects are assigned, and using computer programs help alot and give that proffesional touch. And how coud you forget 'google' the most famous online system, that everyone loves you can do just about anything with that page. So computers bad for society, think again and listen closely. blc computers have just benifited us more than ever. www.facebook.com, that is one of the most visited pages on the internet for all different ages, it deffinetly benefits you. Logging on and seeing your friends profile's newest updates on pictures, videos and life, you get every little detail using facebook. And I you don't have a phone, no. wornes, facebook has a chat system, so you and friends and relatives can talk, or maybe theirs a family party comingup you can get inboxed on all the information, and visit the relatives homepage and see how theyve been doing. @CAPS3 you haven't logged into facebook yet, you deffinetly will now! ""This project will be done on the computer,"" how many times do you hear a teacher says that, almost everytime youre given an assignement! @CAPS1 windows and @ORGANIZATION1 programs will really benefit you in your need for school help. Lets say you've been assigned a project to create a product commerical in computer class, you can hop right onto windows movie maker and get all the help you need, and you'll have the ability to create you project right on the program so it looks and sounds professional. One program you can always use throughout life for presentation is 'power ', In my history class we were assigned a famous person from the @DATE1's and were to do a presentation; @CAPS1 when I got my assignment I went right to powerpoint and got a great grade! lastly the known, @ORGANIZATION1 word! used for all kinds of projects or homeworks and espically writing papers or short stories, having spell check, youre garenteed a good grade! Google! Everyone knows it and everyone loves it. This web hit canbe used for just about anything. From searching pictures and information for a school projects, watching videos of songs, friends, or tv shows that you love or wonna check up on. to looking at websites. Some say the @CAPS2 holds people from exersising, but google can shows you videos of special work outs or websites on healthy eating or an on exercise group or fitness club, so now you see the internet benefits us tremendously! ""Have you change your mind? have you listened closely?"" @CAPS3 so your life just become a whole lot easier, by using facebook, for social ability, @ORGANIZATION1 and windows programs for school, and google for life and health, you have just benefitted from my writing and from using modern technology, the computer!",6,5,1
787,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion, spending too much time online has negative effect on society. People aren't getting a full social experience when they talk on email, facebook and twitter. Being on such sites has taken up time that could be spent in other areas, such as family, friends and school. They aren't being able to enjoy the outdoors and being able to exercise. Though online activity can be helpful spending too much time can be harmful. Interacting online can be a great experience for those who have friends and family who live far away. But spending too much time online can damage you social activity levels. In person interaction is better than online, because you see how the person you're talking to is reacting to everything you say. Having a good, positive social environment is benificial to you and your friend. Spending too much time on the computer can also damage you social relationship with your family. For family who live far away, and online is the only way to socialize, online interaction is a great thing to have. But for you close family, you could be missing out on their lives and how they are doing. Your relationship with you family could be in jeoporady because you insist on using your computer. When you use the computer, you're probably eating some food too. And spending time online is taking away your time from exercising those calories off. The obesity level in @LOCATION1 is increasing, probable cause being over-usage of computers. being outside is another thing missing from our lives because of computers we aren't experiencing the beautiful nature life our @ORGANIZATION1 has to offer, online activity is hurting our health, and making us not enjoy our outdoor life. In conclusion, being online too often is abusing our social, health, and taking up too much of our lives. Using the internet is good for adults so they can pay taxes, work at home, and do many other beneficial things for them and their families. But for other, less useful sites are being used to interact. Why not just call or meet up with person, instead of using the computers?",4,4,0
1060,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 a place where they are all on computers all day long, everyday. I donÂ’t think computers are a benefit to society because you get less time exercising, less time enjoying nature, and you spend less time with family and friends. Computers are not a benefit to society. To begin, computers are not a benefit to society because it gives you less and less time exercise. And wouldnÂ’t you want to go exercise and lose weight. Other than just sitting around on your new computer and having your brain being wrecked out by it. @PERSON1 said that @PERCENT1 of people that get a new computer spend @NUM1 minutes more than what time they usually spend on it. Next, is that you could be outside enjoying nature. New @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Newspaper said that they are worried that it too many people got a good computer that no body would be outside enjoying what left of nature. Because sooner or later there wont be any trees left in the world and humans would became extinct for eternity. Lastly, is that you wont be spending any time with your family or friends. Like when I got x-box live, I couldnÂ’t get off of it. I was addicted to it. And when my family got our new computer, my older sister couldnÂ’t get off of it. She would spend all day and all night on it. Now, if parents take the computer away from kids they will have more time to exercises more time to enjoy nature, and more time with family and friends. Computers are not good toward society.",4,4,0
1605,"Dear local newspaper, I think the effects of computers are good. Some reasons I think this is that we get a lot of knowledge from it, contact people you donÂ’t live near and haven't seen in a while. My first reason why I think the effects of computers are good because you can get a lot of knowledge from it. One example would be if you want to make a @CAPS1 meal, you wouldn't find it in an ordinary @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 you would have to look up on the internet for the recipe. Another example is if you wanted to travel to @LOCATION1 by car and you didn't have a map how would you get the directions? You would go on the computer, look up directions to @LOCATION1 and print it out. You would have never been able to go to @LOCATION1 if you didn't have a map or a computer. My second reason why I think the effects of computers is good is because you can contact friends or family that you have not seen in a while. One example would be if your sister just graduated from college and you wanted to congratulate her but you were @NUM1 feet in the air by a airplane and all you had was your laptop and your luggage, you would e-mail her saying good job. These are just a few reasons why I think the effects of computers is good, and I hope the local newspaper agrees too.",4,4,0
555,"Dear newspaper, I heard you were discussing if more and more people using computers was a benefit to society. I believe that @CAPS4 has a negative affect on people. They get to interact with people who arent safe, they spend less time exercising and they get into more trouble thean before. Spending more time, online in chat rooms causes people to meet preditors. Take my friend @PERSON5 she was online one day when a man started to talk to her. She thought he seemed acceptable when he said he was @NUM1 and a model. She flirted with him on and on, day after day until one day her friend logged on and found out the man was really @NUM2 and a pervert. @PERSON5 @CAPS1 the only on that this has happened to @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people in chat rooms say they have been lied to like this. Website designer @PERSON2 say, ""More and more people everyday are falling for lies over the @CAPS5 and getting in sticky situations like getting asked to meet the person."" @CAPS1 the saying ""@CAPS2 talk to strangers?"" Spending all your time sitting down on the computer means less time outside exercising. At triputs, this girl @PERSON4 wasnt in shape enough to stay up with the players. Instead of being our practicing like the rest of us, she was in her house talking on facebook. She wasnt prepared when @CAPS4 came, time to show what you had so she didnt make the softball team. The next year she made captain because she was out training everyday before the big day. She's not the only one with a laziness problem. @NUM5 out of every @NUM6 americans are couch potatoes and choose to go online than to stay in shape. Nutritionalist, @PERSON1 says, ""This generation is worse than the last. They complain when they cant do something but thats because instead of going outside, they're on their butts watching @CAPS3 or online."" @CAPS4's a breath of fresh air, what do you have to loose? Kids seem to get in alot more trouble online then they ever have on the streets. They're out posting threats, dissing each other, sending personal messages or pictures and worst of all sometimes hurting someone so bad they commit suicide one year. The neighbor was more popular than this lady's daughter so she created this person online that the neighbor fell for. The online ""guy"" began trashing the teenage girl so bad she ended up hanging herself. People, including singer @ORGANIZATION1 have been caught in sexting. @CAPS4's embarrasing, innappropriate and against the law yet @CAPS4 still happens. These people are not alone. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 people have gotten in big trouble through the @CAPS5. Governer, @PERSON3 says, ""@CAPS5 and phones are destroying this society. Theres too much real life drama already."" @CAPS6't you see something wrong with all of this? My opinion on @CAPS4 all is that we should use the computers less before we all start interacting with people that will scare us, become couch potatoes, and get into huge trouble. @CAPS4's really not worth the damage of getting scared, hurt, lazy, or taking your own life.",5,6,1
1626,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have come very far with technology. Computers and other gadgets have helped us go farther. But the computer is one gadget that does not benefit society. My reasons for this are when you are on a computer you could be cyber bullied. My next reason is that when you stay on too long you miss out on stuff like being with family. The last reason why computers do not benefit society is when you type on a computer the spell check on @CAPS3 checks spelling and puncuation and grammar so you don't learn from your mistakes. These reasons support me in saying computers haven't really benefited society. Firstly, my first reason for saying that computers have not benefited society is you can get cyberbullied. For instance somebody goes home and checks their email. They get threatening emails. They are scared what do they do. Cyber bulling, being induced by computers, is the easiest way to bully somebody. You can make them feel bad without doing anything besides typing a message. All you really have to do is find out somebodys email. Also cyber bulling could be anybody. Some one you knkow or someone you don't. computers haven't helped in society by inducing more crimes. Next my reason is if you stay on too long you miss out on life. Between checking email accounts and updating @CAPS4 the average person spends @PERCENT1 of their day on the computer. People who spend that much time on the computer miss things. My sister always come, out asking questions in the middle of the conversation because she's following and updating on @CAPS4 while @CAPS2 are having a conversation. People miss things while on the computer. Lastly, when you are typeing an essay or something you don't learn anything about grammar or spelling because spellcheck checks it for you. Most teenagers in @LOCATION1 when texting don't use proper grammar or spelling. So they can write an essay in text language and when typing it over students choose what they mean from spellcheck and move on. This is unacceptable because students must learn proper grammar and spelling. This is reducing students thinking levels just above read and click the awnser. If computers did everything for us @CAPS2 would be mindless slugs quick. In conclusion I think computers have not benefited society. Computers inducieng cyberbulling. When you type spellcheck corrects your mistakes so you don't learn and people miss stuff when on the computer. Computers have not helped society for all of these reasons and more. Computers should be used less.",4,4,0

Computers @CAPS7 allow easy access to the news and online textbooks which provides an enourmous amount of benifits to today's society. In the long run, doing more things by computer instead of on paper will save billions of trees! @CAPS7, computers teach us hand-eye coordination which is a tremenciously important skill.

Four out of five teenagers would agree that without computers or technological advances, their long-distance relationships with family and friends wouldn't be possible.

Let me explain my reasoning in the next few paragraphs. First and foremost, there are lots of things to do. You can play online games, off-line games, surf the web, chat, match videos, and so on and so forth. Without the internet I probably would have lost my interest in @ORGANIZATION1.

1467,"Almost everyone in the @LOCATION1 uses a computers at one point in their life. Computers are a way to teach hand eye coordination through programs, games and typing. The internet can be used for researching different far away cultures, as well as someone's own lifestyle. This compact well made piece of technology has been belaming more and more intricate. Realizing how much help computers have in everyday life, people will be the down fall or support for computer technology moving forward. One very basic but evident result from using a computer is hand-eye coordination. Since the time children are in grade school, they learn typing on a keyboard. Special programs help kids learn the necesary skill while enjoying the practice. When I was small, a mere fight years old, I remember typing. I was always excited when my mom and I went to barnes and noble to pick up a new typing program. I especially enjoyed ""type to learn"" and @CAPS1 typing lessons as well as teaching children to type is general, teaches hand-eye coordination in high school, college, and the job world. Young adults and adults are expected to type papers, resemes, and applications. In this day in age the technology era has begin and typing is a necessity. Another way to teach hand-eye coordination is through computer games. A simple challenge like solitaire, bejewled or car racing teach the skill and much more advanced games for example, world of war craft need perfect coordination can be through typing and games, both on the computer. Though some experts are conserned ""people are spending too much time on the computer and less time..enjoying nature,"" you are able to learn about geography, travel, and nature.

It gives you hand-eye coordination give people info on faraway places. They can also rent hotels movies and games. You can even talk to people online from around the world! What if we didn't have computers though then what if a serious crime happend then we wouldn't be able to find the criminals name or his records! Some bad reasons for having computers is a big issue right cyberbullying! Kids might get picked. On and he will. People get called names all the time.

They're useful because people can talk to friends and family members that they haven't seen in a long time and computer skills are required in the real world. Hand-eye coordination is very important and using a computer can help people build up the coordination. This helps because if one has to type a @NUM1-page report, then one who has good hand-eye coordination, or typing skills, ""can finish a report in @NUM2 minutes or so. If one has poor hand-eye coordination, well that @NUM2 minute report will take about a few hours. No one likes to be sitting infront of a computer for a few hours. Everyone has friends and best friends that they talk to every day, But what happens if that friend moves out-of-town, out-of-state or possibility out-of-country? They might be forgotten or never seen from again. Well, thanks to technology and the advancement of computers, people can chat online on @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messaging, myspace or facebook. They can catch upon things, check out what's new, even see posted pictures of them. The same thing can be applied to family members who have moved away.

Skilled people who have a good knowledge of the computer world can get great jobs like a computer programer for the state, or they can create websites for their own jobs. Other jobs people with computer experience can have would be an editor of movies or @CAPS2 shows. That's big money there. No wonder schools have computer classes.

Without a doubt, spending too much time on computers will rott your brain and make you lazy. Meaning that the less you excersise, the less active you are. This problem is specially for teens. Teens have computer every week. cell phones, ipods, and many more. Alot of teens get cranky and the become node and neisty to their parents because they are testing to. As people dont excercise and move around alot, cause severe consequences like obesity and cancer. Obesity usually happens when you eating food, but it can also ahppen by not eating and not exercising. People that arent moving become lazy and have no desire to do anything which will an effect .

711,"Dear editor, Have you ever stopped and asked yourself which was more important? Of course I can be talking about anything, but what about computers verses family, friends, nature, your own health etc. Well, I ask myself that quite often, and I feel that it's so much more worth it to be with family and friends than to be infront of a computer. There is so much more that I can tell you, and just after my very first reason how could there even be another side to it? Why is it that now these days kids can't simply run out to the bus stop without feeling totally winded? I feel it's because they are not getting enough well needed exercise! For example, instead of sitting infront of the computer, kids, and even adults can enjoy going to the gym. Also, children can get more involved with school sports so they can not only be participating in sports, but they can be involed with school too! Lastly, just by going for a short walk with your dog, your not only walking and getting well needed exercise, your bonding with your loyal friend. Have you ever been gazing out the car window when you just found yourself being sucked into all the beauty that nature has to offer? Well, if you have I guess you could never have too much, but if you haven't, its probably because your spending way too much time on the computer! There are so many different ways that people could learn to appreshiate nature more, such as sitting on a park bench in the @TIME1, while absorbing the fresh air and sunlight. Or you could go for a slow, realaxing bike ride through a trail with a constant cool breeze, brushing your face with every of your wheels. Finally, you could pick a warm day to sit out on the beach, and listen to some music, next to the salty ocean. How could you resist those temptations? Lastly, I believe that family is the most important thing to missing out on! Without family and friends you miss out on so many good ethics and experiences. You lose out on having good lifetime realationships, and how could you turn dow the offer to be with the people you love? In conclusion, I feel that computer are taking away most of the things that no one deserves to live without. I mean, how could anyone live without family, friends, the beauty of nature, and your own health? That is why everyone should make the right desition to take reasponcible charge of their life, and the same question, which is more important?",5,5,1
1456,"How would you like to got a ""@CAPS1"" on your social studies report? What if you couldn't see your school friends at all after-school? What if you were bored to death, and you couldn't watch t.v. or play games? Some experts are about people because they think they are spending too much time using their computers and not enough time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. On your computer: you can watch videos and play games, you can chat and talk to people, and you can even boost up your grade. I honestly think that the thought of people being on their computers too much is a silly thought @CAPS2, let's look at how a computer can change your life. Lets say you have a history report the tomorrow, you forgot your history book at school, and you know nothing about the report. You are going to fail if you don't hand it in, so why not turn on your computer and open up the internet browser. I remember @TIME1 year I was doing a report about the @CAPS4 @CAPS3. I literally knew nothing about them and I failed to bring home my book. I opened up the internet and typed in @CAPS4 @CAPS3 in @ORGANIZATION1 and @DATE1 I found out that I got a @NUM1 on the report. You can also use the computer just to look up information for for about something that you might learn in school. ""@TIME1 @DATE1, I was reading about the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and a few days @DATE1 we talked about how that @CAPS7 posibly could have been made. I was the only student in our grade that knew that answer. You can use the computer for playing games that are related to school. For example, how fast can you complete all of these multiplication problems or division problems. Look at what computers can do. If you got bad grades (without computer), you will go to a bad college and have a bad job, however, if you got good grades(with computer), you will go to a good college and get a good job. Next, let's look at how you can chat or talk to people. You can have a mesaging connection with someone by using @CAPS8 or a free to free conversation using @ORGANIZATION2 on your computer. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people with computers have either @CAPS8 or @ORGANIZATION2 installed in their computers. You can also communicate with people who has an email address. I remember having a problem with my laptop and my crush knows everything about them. So I emailed him and how I get a response and I fixed my laptop. You are able to interact with people by meeting them online and then them on public. Everyone know about those dating websites that matches two people and them together. A computer can really the of your life. Lastly, let's look at what you can do in the computer when you are bored. Why you go youtube and watch videos that look appropriate and interesting? ""@CAPS10, I was done with homework and I didnt know what to do, so i online and spend only watching youtube videos, sometimes people like playing games. Just @TIME1, I was playing tetris, but only for @NUM2 minutes because I needed a goodnight's before the @CAPS11. You can also listen to the radio on a website. Statistics show that @PERCENT2 of people that listened to the radio @CAPS10 were in cars. But @PERCENT3 is also @PERCENT4 more listening to the radio online. Not only can a computer increase your grades and improve your life, can entertain you as well. As you can see, saving the of computers is is a silly idea and is absolutely non-sense. Computers can and make you. I honestly never seen someone on the computer for.",5,5,1
101,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever gone somewhere, taken pictures, and posted them on the computer? If you have you will remember where you visited. But atleast you went to @ORGANIZATION1, or @LOCATION1 or somewhere. There are some people who are on the computer all day. Instead of experiencing nature and taken on @CAPS1 life brings to them, they are on facebook or youtube all day. This disgusts me because there are many fun, beautiful, and entertainings things to do. In @CAPS2 opinion I think computers have negative effects on people. People miss out on enjoying nature or interacting with friends and family. Some people do not get exercise anymore and it hurts to see obese people just sit ther and do nothing about there lives. First I'd like to talk about obesity. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of children are obese at young a young age? Computers take the place of exercising for a young boy or girl. They should go outside and play sports like basketball or soccer. Another thing is those game websites. Children get so caught up in a computer game, everything around them just disappears. All they worry about is winning the game. While playing this game they might eating doritos. Sooner or later five pounds is gained. Then they will regret not exercising and not be able to move. Later in life, when things are bad for them, they will realized on how many fantastic things they missed. Then they will say ""@CAPS1 did I do with @CAPS2 life?"" @CAPS2 next point shows that people are not enjoying nature. Have you ever taken a nice walk in the park? I know I have. Well people sit inside all day just taking a peek out the window, but don't think about going outside. Nature is beautiful, smells nice, even refreshing at times. But no. People sit on there butt all day. On the computer accomplishing absolutely nothing. Why can't they go outsite for a walk or a jog? People can see animals like squirrels climbing up a tree. How cute. But instead they play a virtual game where you shoot squirrels with a paint ball gun. So much is missed because of computers. As much as not enjoying nature upsets me, some people blow off their own family just to watch a re-run of family guy on youtube. @CAPS1 have we come to? Some children hit their parents because the parents shut the computer off. I'd rather enjoy a meal with @CAPS2 family and then just sit down, relax, and talk. Also some people don't get sleep becuse they are ""doing something important"" and miss a family trip or even school. In conclusion I believe that computers are bad because of obesity, missing nature, and not enjoying company of family & friends.",5,5,1

I was in @CAPS1 one day and made a survay, for how many people agree that not many people because of computers aren't interacting in any activities. @PERCENT1 of the people I asked said they agree but of corse the others didn't care much.

1006,"I strolled into my bedroom, I noticed the computer sitting on a wonder desk. I thought that computers are very helpful. There are many controversies on whether computes benefit or do not benefit society. My opinion on this topic is that computers are useful and I support this technology. Computers are excellent tools that could help students with work in school. For instance, this year I had a sciences project about how my hobbies interests are related to science. One of my interests in reading, @CAPS1 I had to research about how reading a simple back can be related to science. I went on the internet, typed in my question about reading, and two seconds later thousands of results up. I had even gotten some pictures too. A couple of days later after I had handed in my project, I recieved it back. I had gotten a @NUM1 on this project! @CAPS1 being able to use a computer really boosted my grade in science. Without the internet, I probably wouldn't have been able to get on A on this. As you can see, computers can help students with projects, etc. in school. Using this technology can help you reconnect with friends and family members. In elementary school, my friend @PERSON1 had moved away to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2. I had no way of communicating with her until I found a program on the internet that lets you chat with people. Both of us had been using this and we've been able to talk for on end. I don't see @PERSON1 as often as I had used to, but with my computer wide open in my bedroom I can chat online with her almost everyday. Computers can help re-establish old relationships with friends and family. @CAPS1 communicating on these are also another benefit. Using computers can help enrich peoples minds. For example, in school we use a program called, ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4."" @CAPS3 @CAPS4 involves you playing games that help you @CAPS3, and tests when you are ready to take them. @CAPS3 @CAPS4 has been helping us practice for the @ORGANIZATION1's. After taking multiple tests in subjects such as science, math, and language arts, I now feel confident about taking the @ORGANIZATION1's and I believe I am going to do well on these tests. As you can tell, the tool of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on the computer can benefit your school grades. The effect computers have an people are that they help and benefit the society. I think that more citizens should own computers because they can expand your knowledge. I am clearly in favor of owning and using computers.",4,4,0

Lastly all this communicating is great because you dont have to travel to communicate with someone   the world is more eco-friendly. Wow! There are over I  information sites on the computer.

200,"Dear Readers of @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 has been borught to my attention that there is dilema on the effect of computers on people. Well I believe that having computers around are good because. Computers help students do there school work better. They also give the ability to learn about far away places. Lastly, computers allow people to talk to othe people online or webcam. My first reason I believe computers are good to have around is. They help students do there school work. Sometimes teachers give assignments out and you have to write an essay. @CAPS2 the student does @CAPS1 on a computer they might get a higher grade because @CAPS1 looks neater and more proffestional. Computers especially help out college students. A college university took poll one time. @PERCENT1 of student wouldn't know what to do @CAPS2 they didn't have there computer or laptop. One student even said ""@CAPS2 I didn't have my laptop I would probably fail most of my classes."" Computers can be very helpful when @CAPS1 comes to student school work. My second reason that I believe computers are good to have around is. They give the ability to learn about far away places or other coutries. I took a poll one time of how many people use a computer to find out whats going on in other countries, @PERCENT2 of them said they go on the computer to find out what's going on in another countries. Computers can be very handy when you want to know whats going on in other countries. My last reason why computers are good to have around is. Say you married and you are pregnant unless your guy of course, but your spouse is in @LOCATION2 and you couldn't them. Well computers these days have webcams.

Computers are bad for society. And I will show you why. There are many great activities you can do such as reading a book. Instead of reading on the computer, read a novel, you can ask your parents to drive you to the library. I understant that if you need to do research you can do it on the computer but in the library there are all sorts of books such as fiction, nonfiction, science books and many more. Every intelligent citizen would @CAPS1 that computer @MONTH1 have wrong information. I remember when I was doing a project on @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 music. I used the computer to research who killed her and it said that a man killed her. I went to the library and checked out a book on her and it said that a woman killed her actually. In addition books help you get more accurate facts. Every caring, loving human cares about spending time with their family. How can you spend more time with your family? Well, you can visit some cousins on the weekends. Your family can make parties. I recall having a party for my baby brother's baptism, everyone came. I got to see my aunts, and cousins that I didn't see in years. I understand that if you have a far away relative you would use the computer to chat with them or see them on webcam, but why not take a vacation were they live and go by car, that would bring the family even closer. I @CAPS1 what that is like. My family lives in @LOCATION2 and I visit them every year. We have family reunions, maybe your family can do that too. As a result, family is important, so don't let the computer ruin yours. Do you ever go outside anymore? Is the computer getting in your way? You have to check your e-mail, reply, go on your @CAPS4, its hungry, you have to do your daily activities. What about your health? Getting fresh air can be good. These are many great things you can do outside. For example, you can jump rope, go to the park, go swimming, play in the snow and many more. I remember the time my cousin came over and we went to the park. We stayed these until the park closed. It was very entertaining. Every citizen in @LOCATION1 wants to be healthy. Going outside can help you, run through the woods, or even jump roping is outside and excersizing. In addition just going outside can do more. Now is the time. Why wait another minute?

431,"Dear officials at the @ORGANIZATION1, have you ever been so bored that you spent the whole day on the computer talking to friends and relatives? Some experts are saying that computers are having a negative effect on people in our society. While others argue that they are very helpful. the use of computers has been taken to an extreme level, and is having a negative effect on the community. Some reasons I feel this way are because of the social limit computors are putting on people and the amount of time people spend on them. My last reason is that computers are the general health of people today. People should be educated on the negative effects computers bring! Firstly, computers are greatly changing the way people communicate. Instead of talking to people communicate. Instead of talking to people face-to-face, teenagers and adults find themselves '@CAPS1"" or ""@CAPS2"" their friends and colleges. This is causing many bad-habit forming. People are it more to talk to physically, and might even be using terms like ""@CAPS3"" and ""@CAPS4"" instead of works. This problem is causing a huge gap in the social-wonangs of humans, and is harming them more know! Secondly, the amount of time wasted on the computer is unbelieveable! If someone logged onto the computer to search a fact or ""@CAPS5"" something, they might get caught up in other programs and spend hours on the computor. This time could have been used for more productive things instead. A recent polls shows that that average person from ages @NUM1 spreads over two hours on the computer each day! This fact is quite amazing, because these people could have been getting more things accomplished in this time. The amount of time wastedon computers is a huge problem that needs to change! Lastly, humans' health is being affected drastically by the use or computers. As the obesity rate is rising, these people are just sitting on their computors watching it go up. During this time, they could be exercising, going to the gym, or even taking a walk with friends. Teenagers could be playing outdoors, but find themselves too busy on their computors to enjoy the fresh air. Whenever I talk to my friends, they usually say they are on facebook or oovoo instead of outside or playing with their siblings. The obesity rate will keep rising if these people don't realize that staying on computers all day long is a part of the problem! In conclusion, the use of computers has gotten to a point where it is hurting society, rather than it I feel this way because of the social-flow it is teaching people, and the amount of time wasted on computers. Another major reason is because of the extreme health issues computers are. If the average person tried! to limit the time they use their computers, they would notice a positive in their life-style!",5,6,1

There is no way possible that computers are bad. for example computers are good for motor skills and what about school work computers help a lot when you forget your homework log at school and lastly sociability! I don't know about you but I couldn't live without computers! Computers teach hand-eye coordination! which we all know we need to play sports! Also with all the typing you do there is definatly some exercise for your wrists! I should know that they do because I woke both my wrists, at the same time and when I went to rehab they told me I should try getting my wrists back to normal by typing and having of calcium but that's another story. Computers are also great for school say that you forget your homework log at school so you don't know what you had for homework well you could call a friend but wouldn't adjust be easier to go online to the teachers webpage? teachers always have there homeworks listed on a school web page. And no you realize you forgot your mathbook to! have no fear the online textbook is here! and thats a lot easier then going back to the school to get it! don't you think?

I think that computers have a positive effect on people. I think that many people now a days work alot so they might not have time to remember little things such as going to buy newspaper or they might not even have time to watch the news on tv, but because of computers they can read or see the same things but in less time. Some people have a job that includes computers so they could also read the newspaper on their computer while also working. This benefits sociaty its own way. I believe computers are very useful to everyone. C omputers can help people get in touch. They can keep in touch by using webcam and etc. It could also let them communicate. Computers allow people to see each other from different places in the world. It gives people a chanve to see the people you couldnt see from afar. In my opinion people can also learn from computers. Computers have many positive effects that are very important. They give people a chance to learn things. This can benefit sociaty because the more knowledge people have the better it is. It gives people who didnt get a chance to learn what they wanted to actually do so and learn it. Computers do benefit sociaty lets take @PERSON1 for example he says that @PERCENT1 of kids believe that computers have helped them in their own way. Many people can be bored at times but because of computers and the fun things it has such as games, videos... etc.. People get to actually spend some time doing something like @PERSON1 stated kids believe computers are helpful because by playing those games it can give them hand eye coordination and help them in different ways at the sametime. (takes away boredom and lets them get good hand eye coordination) Computers also benefit sociaty by letting people has such technology. Many time technology is needed in everyones life. Technology has helped many people and still continues to. Computers is one of the technology that helps people. Technology can teach people things that they do not even know they could do. In conclusion I believe computers have many great positive effects on people, and it also doesnt only benifit people that use this technology it benifits others in a way too.

Would you go outside and maybe @CAPS3 the soccer ball around with your kids, or grab a bag of chips and log onto facebook or your email? The question is, do computers have a negative or positive effect on people. I believe that computers have a negative effect. Talking to friends on the computer doesn't let you learn social skills. Going on the computer can also be very addicting. Finally, it take's away from all the exercise you need. I @CAPS4 that after careful consideration you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people. Facebook, ichat and email are all fun and easy ways to talk to your friends and family online. However, are you really gaining any social skills by doing this? Talking to friends and family online doesn't help you have good social skills. When you first meet someone in person, you most likely want to @CAPS4 @CAPS2 to say and how to act. Typing on a keyboard doesn't really let you interact with people. @CAPS6 not invite someone over, or go out to lunch with your family istead? Computers also are very addicting. I can say for myself that once I log onto the computer, I might not be off for the next hours. This is the case for many other people too. Going on the computer is addicting. Il @CAPS4 that not everyone is using a computer on a daily basis the vast majority of people are. When I'm on facebook and I see the number of people online is one hundred or even two hundred, as time goes by, the number increases. The computer being addicting leads to getting enough exercise. Doctors say that adults and kids should get atleast an hour of exercise a day. Going on the computer takes away from this time. Instead of sitting on the computer for an hour, you could be getting your hour of exercise. instead A lot of times when someone @CAPS5 down at the computer, a snack goes with them. This just adds onto the fact @CAPS6 getting the exercise is important to stay healthy. I @CAPS4 that I would feel a lot better if I went for a run instead of going on the computer. You are probably saying that you have time to manage both, but some people would rather exercise. When these people see you on the computer, @CAPS2 kind of example does it set? If everyone limited their time on the computer we would all feel a lot better and be more social. I trust that you will agree with me that computers have a negative effect on people.",5,4,1
1178,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student I believe that computers have many bad effects on people. Most people think that computers are just new helpful technology, but there is more to it than just that. There are many things going on in the cyber world. Computers are quite helpful in school research, work and other important stuff, but there are many bad effects too. Kids these days are so attached to their computers almost all day after getting home from school which means that they barely do homework, projects, and important assignments from getting too distracted by the computer. There are some parents who get tricked by their kids that they are just doing homework, but reality is that kids these times are meeting tons of strangers through social networks such @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 @NUM1, @CAPS6 and other networks. Once that they decide to meet in person with these strangers many things go wrong because not everyone is @CAPS2 nice @CAPS2 they @MONTH1 seem through the internet. It shows how dangerous it can be for kids to be using the computers so much. people such @CAPS2 young children, pre teens and teenagers are able to view many harmful and inappropriate things anyone their ages shouldn't be viewing at all. Another concern is how people spend all day on their computers probably eating any type of junk food and then they don't exercise at all and they gain weight and not well fit physically which becomes a health issue for kids @CAPS2 age @NUM2 to much older people such @CAPS2 age @NUM3 and much older too which turns out to be a bad health life for people. From people spending nearly all day on the computer, they aren't able to go out and discover new things, exercise, hang out with friends or just have fun and spend time with their families. I also do strongly consider that the computers or laptops should not stay in a kids room because then they lock themselves in their room all day and they even stay up till really late even past midnight and then it becomes a real issue for kids or adults to get up early in the @TIME1 for school or work and are usually late. This pretty much shows how computers are not so great for people all the time.

4,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 I have found that many experts say that computers do not benifit our society. In some cases this is true but in most cases studdies show that computers can help people. While nothing beats talking in person computers can get really close such examples are webcams or e-mail. @PERCENT1 of students who get good grades refer to reliable websites for reasearch or to help find good books. Also online catalouges or advertisments help the economy of stores worldwide. @CAPS2 people were not allowed to use computers most of the modern would not exist. @PERSON1 said that the best form of modern communication is the computer because of the ability to write, talk, or write back for much cheaper! Almost every single event i go to is planed on a computer by communication such as e-mail ""@CAPS2 a student ever needs homework because lam out sick or needs help studying for a test then contact their teacher through the best form of communication for them always e-mail. Even the post office uses computers to get letters and boxes to people. The president of the post office, @PERSON2 said ""@CAPS3 would be imposible to get mail to our coustmers @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for computers telling us where a zip code is or how heavy a box is."" @CAPS4 that tell people what is happening around the world would not exist @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not for the moder communication abilities that computer provid us. Because information can be commucated so quick. so can reasearch. When the country of @LOCATION2 took a pole @PERCENT2 of people used computer for any type of reasearch, of those @PERCENT3 were students currently in school and @PERCENT4 of them have good grades. When the same survey was taken in the @LOCATION1 @PERCENT5 of people used computers fore reasons and @PERCENT2 were students who had good grade @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were not posible for me to access documents in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 online I probably would not have gotten an A+ on my @CAPS7 assignment! Could you amagine @CAPS2 suddenly your Newspaper reporters couldn't use the internet to work on their reports? The articles would probably be @NUM1 after the events occur. Most buissness, including the Newspaper, use the internet to advertise, shop, or read. The association of @ORGANIZATION1 reported that in @PERCENT1 of @ORGANIZATION1 used a website and of them @PERCENT5 were in good positions. The president of @CAPS8 @NUM2 imports said that they use an online catalouge because @CAPS3 is cheaper, but they can also promote that @CAPS3 is to save trees, or for the castomer's convinence. Small @ORGANIZATION1 can make websites to promote them selves and explain their star to potential coustomers. @PERSON3, the owner of @ORGANIZATION2's said that the internet saved her resturant. @CAPS2 @CAPS3 wer not for the internet @NUM3 more people would be jobless in @LOCATION3. In conclusion computer help everyday people and without them most convinences would not exist. They help communicate around the world. Computers help people reaserch subjects for school reports, and they make the current economy get better everyday. In moderation computers are the most useful tool out there.",5,5,1
31,"I agree that computers deffinately are an advantage to our society. I think this because they help us communicate and video chat with family and friends online, used as a great tool with school work, or work purposes. Most of all for the enjoyment of children and now the fun computer games help them prepare for real life consequences,like how the game webkinz teaches kids to care for pets. ""@CAPS1 you have a @CAPS2?"" @CAPS3 @CAPS4, my @CAPS5. ""@CAPS6, please friend request me"", I replied. Later that night, I get home and check my @CAPS2, a new notification pops up and I am now friends with my @CAPS5 @CAPS4. My entire family is on @CAPS2 and I think it's so usefull for several reasons, like making plans and parties. I hate writing invitations, but now every year for my birthday party I just type them up, taking less than five minutes. Or, for an even simpler way of sending invatations you can even just type an email or @CAPS2 message. In fact, I just got invited to a party yesterday over @CAPS2. It's so easy, you just create an event and tag all of your friends in the note. Also, it's so easy to get @CAPS13's because you automatically get notified. Technology like this drastically makes life easier. For example, have you ever gotten something new and just can't wait to show your friends? Well, now you can, in the comfort of your own home. All you need is a webcam and you can instantly connect with one of your friends that have one too. ""@CAPS14, @PERSON1! I love what you've done to your room, the pink wallpaper is so cute!"" I said. ""@CAPS15 you! I love your hair today. It's so pretty,"" says @PERSON1. I love webcamming with my friends because you can see and hear them as if they were in the same exact you. As you can see, webcamming is so much easier than spending more time money, and my moms time and getting a ride over her house. Computers make life so much more convienent. Another example how this is so much easier is now computers help you with school work. Have you ever had to write a report? Well, now many times teachers especially enjoy them typed because many students have messy hand writing and most kids won't like writing it anyways. Like myself, I type faster than I write and that's why I agree @PERCENT1 that computers benefit society. Most importantly, computers can help you find a good job online and even help type a great resume for you. How impressive would that be? If I was applying for a professional position of a job, I know I'll type my resume. In conclusion, that's how computers are so helpful, beneficial, important and fun to our society.",4,6,0
539,"Dear newstimes, I really think that computers are a good thing because they let you talk to people online, they have ways or doing things for other people, and people have to manage alot of there money and hills on the computer. First they let you comunicate with other people, did you know that @PERCENT1 of people in the united states have family in a different state, and never get to see them, well, thats when computers come in handy because computers have a thing calle d vidio chat and thats where if you have a webcam you can talk to peoplem from different places around the world because you can see each other both through the camera, also there is a thing called @CAPS1 and that allows you to talk to people whenever you want if they are online, my mom got a @CAPS1 and now she chatting she hasn't seen since highschool and she is very happy to see her old friends again. secondly computers have away of people, like if you have an emergency you can go to the computer and save it. Like if you have an email you can email then if you have and emergency, there is even a thing on the computer that can call someone or even call all for along emergency. @PERCENT2 of the people in the @LOCATION1 say that a computer has many people think that from a computer. Thirdly computers help people paying there bills and with there mony. Did you know that @PERCENT3 of people in the united states pay there bills on the computer and manage there mony on the computer. I know my parents do and I know a lot of other people that do to, and if we didn't pay our bills then we wouldn't be able to have a home or anything and thats pretty much do need computers because if you didn't have them then people wouldn't have a any mony. In conclusion people really do need computers because people like people that they know and they have helped many people in the united states and lastly computers really help you manage money and bills, and every body should have a computer for all of these very good reasons.",5,4,1
299,"Do you think computers have a negative effect on people? Well I don't I think @CAPS2 is on easier way to get information faster. The three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people are to learn about faraway places, to have jobs in the computer, business, and you are able to talk to people from faraway. These are many other reasons but I'@CAPS1 only required to talk about three. First of all, you are able to learn about faraway places you can learn about places you aren't able to see in real life. @CAPS2 is a faster way to get information about news that wouldn't be able to out on newspaper until the next day. If you dont have money to travel then you could just go on the internet and see the faraway places in many ways, @CAPS2's just a better source of information. My second reason is to have a job in the computer business. There are alot of jobs that require computers. If we didn't have computers more and more people would not have jobs. Also, business would be slow because they wouldn't have the information they needed. That is why computers are needed. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, yes people are able to talk through the phone but its not the some if you get to talk and see the person. Video chat is a great way to make new friends and still talk with your old friends. You can talk to relatives, friends, or anyone you want to talk to. If we didn't have computers you would lose touch with people you know that live faraway from you. That would be a terrible thing. In conclusion computers are an easier way to get information. You can learn about faraway places. You can have a job in the computer business. Lastly, you are able to talk to people from faraway, I think computers are a positive thing.",4,4,0
284,"Dear @STATE1 news, Computers are a great machine to use. People can research, learn about any topic or subject and let people talk to friends online I think that computers have a good effect on people. Computers are one of the great inventions we have. They are very helpul in our everyday life. When people need to write a paper for school or do a project you can research what you need if you need to know some thing about, a topic that you don't know about, you can look up questions you have about it on the internet. If your writing a paper and need an answer its all on the internet. Suppose you want to go on a family vacation to california you can plan your whole trip right on your computer, you can book a flight, get a hotel room and even see what there is to do you can see the whole world right from your computer. If you want to learn another language you can learn an entire language on your computer. Also if your to busy to go to collage or want to take another class there are even schools online. The computer is a great way to learn about new things. Finally you can talk to friends online websites like facebook and myspace are great ways to keep in touch with your friends. naother positive way is @CAPS1 you can instant message friends and family without having to wait so long for a response back. If you want your friends you can just message them. I think that computers have a positive effect on people.

Clearly, a life without computers is utter chaos. Computers provide education, and stay in contact with friends and family I'm sure our world greatly benifits from this mericle. Medicine, @CAPS4, @CAPS5 constructing and revolutionizing our life has been made possible by computers. @PERSON1 is an old family friend of mine. He was one of the few people who was working on going to the moon for the very first time. They were astonished with what thier astronauts saw. But computers made the expirience a reality. @PERSON1 remembered recieving some of the first footage of he moon on to his computer, before the photographs and video are released to the public. However, @PERSON1 is not the only person who agrees. Johnson, a principal from a private school in @LOCATION1, after winning an award for best school in @LOCATION1 states @PERCENT1 of our education comes from the computers. We make our students come involved in technology. These are the people who progress to make the best medicine cars and computers. Our students all are benificial to our world today."" @CAPS6 settle for anything less for our childrens' education? In the middle of trajedy; faced with a difficult decision; or even just lonely, longing for someone to count on; who do you turn go first? Your loved ones they are always there for you when you need them. Now because of our access to computers whether accross the world or just the other end of the block. We will always be in contact with the ones we love. @PERSON2, my friend, found out her aunt diagnosed last year with cancer. However, she was in a boarding school in @LOCATION2 while her aunt needed her support. Instead, she was with her every step on webcam, emailing and @CAPS7. She could even contact her doctors to see her condition after. Her aunt conquered cancer with her neice and is living happily. With only a @NUM1 chance of living, @PERSON2 gave her the support she needed through most difficult @CAPS2. Not only did see the positive effects of staying in contact.

1094,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know, the majority of people now posses computers. Computers have greatly advanced society and technology. Some people say that computers have negative effects, but that is not true. Computers have influenced people in many benificial ways. Although some experts want people to use computers less, that technology is required in schools. Kids are fold to type their papers, which lets them finish faster. This faster finish can lead to kids not staying up too late. Then doing homework. That is better for their health. Computers also develop hand-eye coordination which is an essential skill for later in life. In my opinion computers have greatly contributed to technology. They are letting explore place human has ever/could ever go. We can make and distribute item much faster. In addition, computers also let people learn about faraway places about different cultures and different people. Computers can expand everyone's horizons and let them know about places and things that they never knew existed. With are of the largest number of members. Facebook is a website that people use to communicate. More than @PERCENT1 of most students in an average school have one. They communicate there more than they could without computers. Computers aren't making people ""anti social"" or making them interact with friends less, they're actually talking more. Computers are letting people communicate daily with people from all around, without having to wory about running out of cellphone minutes. Overall, computers are letting people broaden their horizons are lock of new things. They are more of a benefit than a burden. Computers are the next best thing since sliced bread.",4,4,0
1283,"Dear @CAPS1, In a recent poll it was determined that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have used or come in contact with computers. @PERCENT2 of those said @CAPS2 use computers daily, and not just for work. This extensive use of technology creates a lack in their exercising habits, @CAPS4, they enjoy nature much less. Furthermore, people spend less time interacting with family and friends. These are demaging effects on our society. ""The biggest reason why people dont exercise, "" says health proffessor @PERSON1, ""is because they just don't have time."" This problem can be directly attributed to the statistic that on average, @CAPS2 spend @NUM1 and a half hours a day on the computer. You can argue that they @MONTH1 be learning new things or broadening their horizons. However, none or which help these people get or stay healthy and in shape. Being on the computer does no good for the body. Click the next link and watch as a beautiful humming bird swarms across the screen of your desktop. You can clearly see its wonder, but can you feel it? Can you smell the fresh air it flies around? The computer can only show you nature, but you must log off and find it for yourself to truly appreciate it firsthand. Society will only cheat itself of the world's splendor while watching it on screen. Fans of computers will argue that they help you interact with people around the world, but what about the people in the next room? Computers @MONTH1 bring you to people globally, but distance you from people at your job, school or home. As humans, they need contact with the outside world. Why limit themselves to typing to people, when they can talk to them? In conclusion, extensive computer use does not benefit society. People will spend less time staying active. More over, people will enjoy nature on a desktop instead of in person. Finally, society will not spend as much time communicating with family and friends in person. The time has come to take a stance. It should be clear that computers are a danger to society.",5,5,1
984,"Dear local newspaper, I agree that computers benefit us totaly. This lets people explore the world and do anything. Also, computers are used for many things. Last but not least @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 households have at least one computer. So computers lets us do anything and everything. It helps most people with their jobs, college/school, and you can even buy a house or car online. It doesn't cost that much and its very usefull. You can look up facts you need or even play games when your bored. It keeps us in touch with the world. Also, many thing require a computer. For example, In order to play xbox live you need a computer with @CAPS1. Xbox live lets you play video games with other people or even your friends. Some homework requires computers and some colleges are only on the computer so you can stay at home. Anything you need you can find it on the computer. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 house hold have computers, or @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 does. I agree that some people waste their time, but without computers everything would be much harder. For example, say you need to having to wait @NUM5 days for the mail. Just @CAPS2-mail it. Most people wouldn't have a job if it weren't for computers. It saves peoples time and lets them do other things except have to drive somewhere to give a letter to them. So I think computers are a huge benefit. Like I said you can do anything. Like @CAPS3. It keeps you in touch with friends if your on vacation from school. They are also used for several different things like downloading music on your @CAPS4. Also, @CAPS5 everyone has a computer.

1200,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 it has been brought to my attention that why on a nice sunny day like this somebody would want to be inside. The sad truth is that too many people are wasting their time inside on their computers, rather than enjoying the day. Computers are negatively affecting the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 population. We are getting to a point where our whole world might be absolutley crazy if nothing is done about this. For one the @LOCATION1 has the most obese children in the world. Generally children should be running around burning off their calories; even some people in their teen years should. Instead kids are sitting in front of computer screens on their virtual games and emails and such. Even doing chores around the house could bring down the obesity rate a lot more then sitting on your butt staring at a screen all day. The whole screen thing brings me to my next point. Staring at those bright flashy lights for too long is not good for your brain, what computers cause @NUM1 out of @NUM2 child ceizures a year. The radioactivity in a computer could also mess you up a lot by giving you cancer, with no cure for any cancer yet you have to figure that everytime you are on that computer for too long you are putting your life at risk. The longer youre on the more and more and more radiation is going to youre brain. Do you really want to cut your life short knowing you are the one that did it to yourself, it could almost be called suicide because if youre reading this than you've been warned.

When @DATE1 comes along you will have all the time in the world to be on the computer but did you know over vacation you lose @PERCENT1 of everything you learned in school. Its been proven that computers cause memory loss. So what if you get back to school and you can't keep up with what's going on, frustrating isn't it? If you would've just read a book during the time you were on the computer maybe you could've gained knowledge rather than using it. Computers can affect you socially because not everybody wants to sit inside on the computer so while people are out having fun, you will be all alone, by yourself with nobody to talk to but a computer, would you like a computer to be your only friend? The debate about this topic could rage on and on for days and still have no winner but in all honesty when you go to turn on that computer think to yourself, is it really worth it? Think of everything you would lose, everything you could never get back, or would you rather do something that you would gain from in the future. Its your choice but be responsible enough to make the one that would benefit you.",5,4,1

My resson for supporting this @CAPS1 that computer are good or bad are that computers have a positive effect on people. The second @CAPS1 is to be able to talk to other people on line. The last @CAPS1 I have is Spending more time with family than on the computer. The first resson that i have for computers is how they have for computers is how they have positive effect on people. The examples that I have to Support this @CAPS1 are that computers tech hand eye coordination, computers given people the ability to Learn about far way place and peop. The second resson that I have on computers is that you talk to people online. The examples that I have to support my @CAPS1 are the website that kids us to talk to their friends like myspace and facebook. The place that kid like to go to are tutube and even blogging about everything and everyone. Some of theis thing can be good if you don't post picture or other this on your myspace or facebook. I think that these website are dangers because somebody can hack in to your file and they can try to talk to you like their your friend. The third resson I have to support my @CAPS1 is that we should spend more time with our family than being on the computer the whole time I have example on want we should do with or familys instead of being on the computers I have some @CAPS1 of games that we can play with our familys instead of being on the computers, The games that we can play with our familys are monopoly, somy, canda landy card, video games, we can also talk to our family instead of talking to our friends the whole time.

Reason three, your health is in jeopardy. Firstly, you loose interaction with family and friends. Because you would spend so much time on the computers. It ruins your marriage if you are married. If you have kids you risk your relationship with them. I am not saying to stop using computers. Because I use them myself. I am saying don't make your life the computer. It's not good for you! Secondly, you need excersize. Stastics show @PERCENT1 of the people who live on their computers gain weight faster would know because as @NUM1 yr old I have gained a little weight because of computers. Most people when on the computer tend to eat more @CAPS1 are all well-known facts. That have been proven. Since, you can't walk with a computer in hand, you stop moving. Meaning you stop excersizing. You have to limit your time and then there is where I believe they (computers) benfit you. Lastly, your health is very much at stake. If you are at the computer for @NUM2 hours at a time your eye-site will pay. My eyes stink when I am on the computer for half an hour. Doesn't your head hurt when you are the computer for so long? Yes, the computer is fun and it gives you things to do, I am the first one to admit that But, it also hurts your heath. For being on the computer for so long you are at risk for carpal tunal syndrome. Which is very painful. Computers are so much fun and make life easier. But, they have disadvantages.

They also, allow people to talk to other people online. Lastly, computers are importat @CAPS2 people that work with them. there are many reasons why I believe that computers benefit our society. Do you know that computers give people the ability to learn about faw away places. Sometimes people, dont know when they want to leave the country. With a computer you can organize it all. Somoe people like my family, like to go visit their familys in other places, @CAPS2 example, once my mom told me we were going on a trip to @LOCATION1 to go visit our family she told me she already got the tickets on the computer. I was very happy when we went and I saw how beautiful @LOCATION1 is. Some people like to see new and beautiful places. Such as , @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2 and even @LOCATION4. Let me tell you about how computers allow people to talk to other people online. Most people have myspace and that allows kids my age to keep in touch. Also, facebook that you can and people that you probly havent seen in a long time. @CAPS2 exsample, one time I was looking aroung facebook and found my old bestfriend @PERSON1. I was so happy cause when she moved I thought i would never talk to her again. I am @PERCENT1 positive that everyone in this world has a yahoo you could find people really quikck and talk to them. Would you belive that there is so many jobs and responsibilities that require you to have a computer. Such as scientists they all have to have computers or else they wouldnt be able to invient all the great things they make. Also, secretaries they have asign dates @CAPS2 their bosses. @CAPS2 exsample, a secretary @CAPS2 doctor has to be able to give and to change appointments. Lastly, students that go to school and most importantly collage with no computers, they wont be able to do their homework. Most people would agree that computers have a positive affect on people. @CAPS2 the reasons that they give the ability to learn about faw away places, allow people to talk to other people online.

For me, computers are a place to have fun with all the different applications. But they can also be used for researching anything you can imagine. I also think tha computer is important because it is where businessmen do their job. My favorite part about the computer are applications like @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and so many more. These apps. are great because on @CAPS5, you can talk to your friends if you don't have a cellphone, or talk to friends that live in another state, @CAPS3. Easily my most favorite application, because I get to talk to my friends, look at pictures of them, see who they are dating, and so many other endless possibilities, You can also play and download games onto your computer. It's always very fun to do things on the computer that you enjoy, and not have to research all the time. The second thing on the computer, is research. Researching can be fun and boring, however you look at it, But researching is educational, and I asked a mother with a @NUM1 year old, a @NUM2 year-old, and a @NUM3 yearl-old and she said ""The most important thing to me on the computer is researching. Its's fun, enjoyable, and most importantly, educational!"" The best thing about researching is that, there are endless amounts of websitees that have information for us to look at, and enjoy. People that work and have jobs, are mostly the ones on the computer, and a lot of them ar researching while working. People that work, are th ones that are basically on the computer @NUM4. Businessmen, designers, etc.... The computers are mostly used by workers for e-mail. My father is always on the computer, checking e-mails, typing something for this boss; and even talking on a video conference. There are endless possibilities for workers because foe some of them, computers are their jobs. Computers, in my opinion, they'are one of the best things created. They are the best because they ahve amazing apps. for me to have fun on. But they also provide an educational opportunity through research. And they are great for people with jobs. I don't think there is any person that can live without one of these technological beauties.",4,5,0

The birds are chirping, the smell of beautiful flowers are filling the air, but instead of playing outside with your neighbors, you are inside trying to master the unbeatable game cubefield on the computer. Computers have had a negative impact on today's society. When people are engrossect with whatever they @MONTH1 be doing on the computer they become very lazy, they lose the motivation to go out and exercise, people also lose intrest in helping around the community. This is why computers have a negative impact on todays society. Statics shows that @PERCENT1 of people would rather stay instead on the computer then out and about helping and working around their neighboorhood. Computers have had such a negative impact it makes people want to stay glued to their chairs with their eyes glued to their monitors. Yes computers have had a lot to do with a lot of technical advances, but at what cost do these technological advances come? Many kids are becoming obese and lack my motivation to come out of their room off of the computer. Computers are making society very lazy this is why they have a negative impact on us. Computers have also made society lack motivation to go and exercise. A very close family friend was very obese. She was lazy and never wanted to exercise. Instead of going out and doing something about it, she stayed in her room on facebook for weeks at a time. Though the computer wasnt the one who made her obese, it was used as a much to hide behind the real problems. It is sad when @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they would rather stay inside on myspace than going outside for a jogg. Yes its true computers helps you learn things you @MONTH1 not have known before, but so do books, newspapers and magazines. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Helping out in your community provides many opportunties to meet new people, and it feel a sense of accomplishment. But the urge to stay in on the computer clouds your better judgement. I know that I would rather help the elemntry school across the street build a new garden rather than stay inside on twitter. If you are inside searching the web how will you know if the old lady across the street needs help with her groceries? Helping around your community lets people know you care about whats going on. So dont let the computer have another second of your time. Computers have had a negative impact on society. Teenagers as well as adults have become very lazy. They lack motivation to exercise as well as help around the community. Now its your turn don't just stare at your computer screen absent mindley.

The world knows we need computers and computers are the smartest thing since the calculator. Buying and selling things on the computer is easier than it looks. All you have to do is put what you want to sell online or look online what you want to buy. Then you buy it or sell it. There is more to the process like the @ORGANIZATION1 people bring or take it to or away from you. But that just the basics.

This is what computers can do to help our socity become better. Firstly, the computer can teach us hand-eye cordination. By playing games , we can use what we learn in real life. A boy can play football on line, then take what he learned and use that in a real football game. Hand-eye cordination on the computer can help us to learn new things about our society. We could use what we learned to discover new things and help us to make the community, as a whole, . These skills can also help us do more things at once. Multitasking is a difficult task to and with hand-eye cordination and computers it becomes easier. A second productive task can help us with is learning . Some people dont know going on in The computer can direct us to news The computer is literally like one huge look of use . Another positive effect that computers have on people is communication. Many people have a twitter, facebook , myspce, etc. and all those websites can help . Products like skpe, video chat , aim and email allow people to have a conversation online.

But it also allows us to communicate with the people online. Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination. Because it's rely important to have hand-eye. And when your out in the world you rely need to be able to look at something and pick it up or say if you get into a altercation with someone. So it's rely important to have hand-eye. Another reason why I feel computers have a posative effect on people is because you could learn about diffrent stuff over the internet. Like learning about far away places and people. So the internet is giving you a great opportunity to learn more about or earth, other than your back yard. So technacally it's preparing you for life. My final reason why I think the computer has a posotive effect on people is because it allows people to talk to other people who are online. Like say you dont have a phone but you have a computer and you need to tell something very important to someone; you could do it online. And people say it's one of the fastest pieces of technology known to mankind to people who need it. Those were my three reasons why I believe the computer has a posotive effect on people. And if you don't believe me go hop on a computer and see for yourself. You won't be dissapointed.",3,4,0
661,"In present day, most people live on the computer. Whether if for work or pleasure, everyone uses a computer. In a recent study, researchers determined that an average person spends @NUM1 years of his or her life on the comptuer. Thats a total of @NUM1 years of life waste. Most kids spend all day on the computer on @CAPS1, facebook, @CAPS2, and youtube. They could be using that time to be around family and friends making memories. Kids dont realize how short life is, they should be hiking, camping, spending time with friends and family. I think years from now when kids grow into adults, they will be looking back and regretting not spending more time with there family, or not taking opportunities to explore the world we live in. Instead, they will be looking back and thinking about the halarious video on youtube that got over one million hits. Also, as you @MONTH1 know child obesety is on the rise, they are more overweight kids then there are then and healthy. If a you look back to the times before computers, you will notice that you will rarely see an overweight child. The computer is to blame for this new pamedemic. Kids should be outdoors playing sports and getting fresh air. I bet that if computers were taken away for @NUM3 year, then the changes in health would be drastic. Kids would be alot healtheir and have lost the weight I hope that everyone can see the harms of the computer by reading this, and they will get rid of this poisiness object. ",4,4,0

Some people think that computers are good to use to help teach hand eye coordination, learn about other places in the world and talk with other people online. I am in @NUM1 grade at mystic middle school. I think that computers are not as good as some people think. Have you ever heard of computer camps. This is where some kids go because they are addicted to the computer. At this camp the kids are pulled away from the computer and pritty much forced to join gropes that do activitys like fishing or working together to solve a mystery. This camp is pritty much known as reliable for kids that are addicted to the computer. Another reason that computers are bad is because of the internet. The internet is a very dangerous. Place because you can chat to people that you dont even know. You never know the people could be messed on in the head. And try to find @CAPS4 where you like and come. you so you always have to be carful who you talk to other wise you could get. Nothing eve really goes right with computers, there alway getting slower and slower every time you use it. About every two years a kid or parent could go throw a computer. Also your computer doesn't have the right @CAPS3 it could get a vins and cost a person a few hundred dollars to get it fixed. Any thing could happen at any time with your computer, @CAPS4 of no where it could just die and not work and @CAPS2 of your data will be gone forever. Now that I have explaines my part of computers people will think different. Would you want to end up like one of those people, that are in a camp because they are on the computer to much. Or you never know you could forever and never be found. I alread know @CAPS5 much it is for coomputers to get fixed, but you might have to find @CAPS4 the hard way. That is why I think that computers just cause more truble for peolple.",4,4,0
1616,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1, Computers have advanced our world so far into the future that practically everything is just a click away. Experts are awed that over the years, computers have helped billions of people get jobs done foster and smoother than ever before. Technology has helped doctors find new cures for patients, and diagnose their sicknesses in a more advanced way. Thousands of professions require the limitless knowledge of the internet, and computers continue to advance and redefine our way of living. Furthermore, kids of all ages benefit from modern computers. As technology becomes more user-friendly, children have adapted to computers giving them answers to all of their questions. As a student at @ORGANIZATION1, I have found that computers are vital in everyday assignments. Essays are now typed and not handwritten and projects are displayed on flash drives, not posterboard. Those advances have shaped our lives, and made everything much easier. Also, foreign places become closer to home, when computers allow you to virtually visit hundreds of different countries. With modern technology, the world is better connected and united. In addition to students, doctors also greatly benefit from computers. Technology has re-shaped the medical world dramatically with x-rays, @CAPS2's, surgeries and medicines. Amazingly, computers allow doctors and nurses to look at patients in a whole new way. Hospitals organize all records digitally to help give the right treatments patients. @PERSON1, the head surgean at @ORGANIZATION2 says, ""@CAPS3 technology, our @ORGANIZATION2 would be useless. We wouldn't be able to do anything."" @CAPS4 @PERSON1 is well-spoken, he makes a very important point. Computers are the building blocks of our medical world. Scientific studies have shown that the internet has brought people closer than ever before. Families separated by thousands of miles now have the ability to email, chat or even video chat with far away relatives and friends. Email has especially played a huge roll in our society, so as to help millions of people communicate when needed. Infact, over @NUM1 million jobs rely on email to communicate important business information. @CAPS3 the aid of technology, our economy would rapidly as communication countries failed to exist. Computers are essential to our culture. I strongly urge you to consider my opinion on the benefits of modern technology and think of all the people computers have helped. Our culture is now bigger, better, faster and stronger, thanks to the help of technology today. Knowing this, I vehimently suggest you educate others in the benefit of technology and play your part in advancing our way of living.",4,5,0
676,"Dear @CAPS1, I feel like computers are good for you in a lot of ways. Like computers sometimes keep kids out of the street so they wont get in trouble. The computer has a lot of games you ran play on so it would keep you doing something. Computers also have something called microsoft and microsoft is something that help you do writing projects and things like that. Computers help a lot of people cause like I said earlier it has games and some of those games have to do with school such as science, math, reading, and social studies so it is very helpful. Computers are also bad for people like you because when you go on it most teens liketo go on something called myspace. Myspace is a thin that you can have freinds all around the world and can talk to them and put pics of yourself on it. If you go on myspace and have friends from different state or the same state you that they world want to find you and rape you. They would start a conversation with you like they would ask you for your name and where you live. Another reason its bad is because when @NUM1 graders go to the middle school @NUM2 grader will tell the inaproperate websites and the little kids would go on it and will get in trouble. Well you heard my opoin I hope you understand thank.",4,4,0
1080,"People are asking me, ""@CAPS1 you think we should spend more or less time on computers""? I say we should spend less time on the computer because children spend to much time on online games. Second kids and adults spend to much time on myspace, facebook, msm, and even aim. My third reason is children should be outside playing and exercising. These are my three reasons why we should spend less time on computers. My first reason we should all spend less time on computer is children play so many online games, such as @CAPS2 of warcraft, @CAPS3, soilder front, ect. A problem with kids playing these games become addicted to them, and will play for hours. Children should be outside getting bigger muscle, getting strong bones. Kids keep playing these games and are ruining their lifes. This is my first reason why we should spend less time on the computer. My second reason why we should spend less time on computers is children and adults spend to much time on the following: myspace, facebook, twitter, aim, msm, ect. These online pages causes people to go on one to connect to their friends. Also with these online pages they cause to much and could lead to fight or rumors. About @PERCENT1 of kids and adults go on these online pages every day its time they stayed going on their computer more time on outside or hangout with their friends. My last but not the least reason is kids should be outside playing instead of being on the computer. Children should go outside with their friend and play sport or games, something that doesn't involve with the computer. This is my third reason why children should not we spending more time on computers. As I said before people should spend less time on computer. Kids spend to much time on online games. Adults and kids spend to much time on online pages. And last children should be playing outside. Its time we put a timer on our computer and spend more time outside.",4,4,0
852,"@ORGANIZATION1, With the recent development @MONEY1 technology in todays society I know that there is a lot @MONEY1 controversy with computers. Many people believe that computers are positive towards our society. While others disagree. I feel that technology can be both good and bad. Technology provides great advancements in our world. But people experience less @MONEY1 the outside world when they surround themselves with technology. But I feel that we can find a balance between the two views. Having computers has brought a lot @MONEY1 advancement in todays society. Look at modern medicine, it would be nothing without todays technology in computers. We can look at todays military. Computers practically run todays armed forces. But who knows where technology can take us. Our society could continue to greatly advance with the help @MONEY1 computers. But then again we could all wonder where would we be today without computers. So @ORGANIZATION1, as you can see computers have helped our society greatly with improvement and progression. But with all @MONEY1 this technology we still need to find a balance. It is live todays @CAPS1 spend cover @NUM1 hours per week on computers. People are not experiencing the world outside @MONEY1 their computers. Our state does put in @MONEY1 each year for our parks just so we can ignore them. Also with increased computer time people are not getting outside. They arenÃ¢Â€Â™t getting proper exercise. You @MONTH1 even notice that if you use the computer too much you will miss more interactions with your family. So although computers can be very useful you need to be able to turn off the computer and realize the true important things in your life, besides the computers. computers can be both good and bad. But I think that we need to find a balance between the two. Computers are useful to our daily life but at the same time we also need to realize that we need to sometimes take a break from our computers. Lets face it without computers today we would not be able to function. Entire companies revolve around computers and if computers just ended, @MONEY1 @MONEY1 people would lose their jobs. But also regular people, for example teens, do not need to be on the computer for four hours a day. Those four hours could be spent with their families. We need to find a balance. For example, you could say for every hour your on the computer you need to spend that same hour to go outside, spend time with your family, etc. Computers are useful but we cannot over use it. So, to the @ORGANIZATION1, computers help our society thrive. But at the same time we need to learn when we have had enough time on the computer. So I believe that we can call find a healthy balance @MONEY1 computer use.",5,5,1
1068,"Computers are a huge impact on society, but do they make everything better? People spend way to much time on the computer. Computers do not help you brain they can make you fat and for a lot of people they cause drama. People should stop spending so much time on computers. Computers do not help you brain in any means possible. Think about it, sure you do alot of you work on computers but, what about your kids they spend most of their time gand online and doing pointless stuff. Instead they could be going outside or even study. the internet is open to the world so anyone goes on it and if your child is on the computer is exposed many vile things that will not help them in the future. Its a proven fact that the less time you spend watching tv or on the computer you get better grades. I remember my mom always yelled at me for being on the computer and getting bad grades so she took the computer away for a while and now i have much better grades. So being on the computer does not make you smarter. The computer can make you gain quit a bit of weight. If your on the computer a lot you are sitting around and a lot people eat while they are on the computer. So now you are sitting around the computer eating. That can make you gain weight. I know from experience that being active and going outside or exercising really makes you feel good. Once you gain all that weight it is very hard to get rid of it. Sitting around like a couch is not healthy. You can become obese. So you could say your happy with your weight but no one ever said it was healthy. A lot of people have died frombeing that beaky. It puts a huge tall on you life. If you dont want to die from being to heavy then I advise you to get off the computer and go outside and live yor life. The last thing that makes computers so bad is the drama they cause. Mose pople have facebook, aim, or @CAPS1 but if you ask anyone with one of those they will most likley say they have gotten in a fight through one of those. Also now they have something new called formspring which can let you be anomous and people go on yours and just say horrible things. One of my friends was a victim in that and it ruins you. Also their are so many people on facebook that lie about who they are and anyone can easily find out who you are and kill you now a days people know how to hack into peoples computers and get info. So computers can not only be unhealthy but they can be deadly. Why would you want any of those things to happen, when its so easy to just back on your computer time. Remember computers dont help your brain, they can make you fat, and they cause a lot of drama. So please dont use the computer.",5,4,1

Another thing is computers give kids a positive ego or entertainment. Also computers let other kids interact with each other like facebook, or @CAPS1. There are many good details why computers are good for the society. First, when most kids dont know an answer to question they can go on google to fing the answer. Which helps in most cases. Also when on google, or any ""@CAPS2 @CAPS3"" it gives kids the chance to @CAPS2 anything and most likly get arreasonable answer.

Another benefit of having computers is most kids on the internet go to have fun or entertain themselves, which could lead to a positive ego or better self-convidence. Just because kids arent going outside to have fun, doesnt mean they cant have fun inside either. Third, parents or any gauriden always talk about there kids or would like to see them with friends. Well having thing such as facebook and @CAPS1 or @CAPS5 you can make new friend around the town or even other @CAPS6. The internet can do all of those things. Finally do computers benefits society?

Obesity is @CAPS4 of the biggest problems in the @LOCATION1 and is growing bigger everyday. Over @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 population is obese and computers have been a major conributer. Put yourself in the mind of a computerf addicy. It is dinner time and you are hungry, but you don't want to lose too much time off of your computer. You hurry down to the nearest fast-food store and by yourself a cheeseburger, fries, and a soda. You then go back to your house and eat the food while on your computer.

In addition, people who thier hand-eye coordination can do it in every other ways than just going on a Computers contribute to a large portion of the obese population, but they also can be extremely time-consuming.

Computers discourage exercise cut down the number @ORGANIZATION1 hours spent bonding with your family and are a waste @ORGANIZATION1 money and space. I believe computers should be re-examined and peole should stop depending on them so much. Which country has more than @NUM1 million fast food, restaurants currently functioning?

695,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons for my answer is that there are many homework helper websites, the computer helps you learn about places you've never been to, and you can even interact with people all around the world. These are my three reasons on why I think computers have a positive effect on people. First, I think computers have a positive effect on people because there are many homework helper websites that struggling students can go on and get tutored. I remember in @NUM1 grade when I had a math midterm. I was having a hard time understanding the math. Then, I went on a tutoring websites and they taught me everything that I was having trouble with. I think that the computer can help many kids obtain good grades. This is my first reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people. Second, I think computers have a positive effect on people because it can help you learn about far away places that you have never been to before. This would be useful for a school project on a country. Also @PERCENT1 of students in my school say that the computer ha s helped them a lot on school projects. The computer could also be useful for planning a vacation. Would you want to vacation to a place that you know nothing about? That is where the computer can help. All you have to do is search your destination and pictures and info will come up so you can make the right choice. This is my second reason why I think omputers have a postive effect on people. Lastly, I think computer have a positive effect on people becuase you can interact with people around te world. I have a brothter that lives in florida, but I can talk to him every day on the computer. Also, I can keep in touch with my friends anytime I want. I think computers help people develop better social skills. This is my last reason why I think computers have a positive effect on people.

The computers that people think of are machines that sit in a room and is used often but not for its purpose. People use it sometimes for entertainment not research. There aren't just those kind of computers. There are bigger more advanced computers that scientist use every day. @CAPS2 computers do have an effect on us, but in a good way. Most of the time those people playing games or music are kids who are bopard. They use it a little too often. I anly play with it on rainy days when I can't go outside and play. Humans use computers mainly because it makes life simpler, easier. @CAPS2, it does make life simpler, like for example instead of handwriting a report, you can type it or intead of searching everywhere in a book, you can go straight to the information. One last example is; when you want to stay updated on your favorite sport team, you don't have to go to their game you just have to go to their web site. In my opinion I say that @CAPS2, computers do have and effect on us but a good reason. I'm a sports fan so I play a lot of sports. I use the computer offer for fun and research. It dosen't have an effect on me. It dosen't effect at all because I still exercise a play with my friends very often, like everyday. There is no reason to why people can't use computers quite often. Computers don't have a positive effect sometime, but it doesn't have a negitive effect sometime either. I exercise, enjoy nature and interact with friends and family too.

1240,"Dear editor, I believe that computers are a great and fun tool. But I also believe people can spend to much time on them. The computer is excellent. People can use them to type papers or reports, makes graphs, and other important things for us. Schools are using computers more and more now. Schools have websites for students to go to findout there homework, classwork, projects, reports, and extracredit. The school has even started doing something very new, allowing parents and kids to check the students grade online. Not only do the schools help students, but also everyday people help as well. if a student has a project but doesn't know how to start it then he or she can google there project and ways to start it. Computers can be real great and easy to use as you can see, for schoolwork. Computers are not only great for academic purposes, but also for leisure purposes. Before computers and internet, there were only these ways to have fun during boring times in the day. One was watching tv, reading a book, or going outside, if you could. What do I mean by that last sentence? If you lived in a city, then it would be harder to go outside because maybe you lived in an apartment or somewhere not a comunity. Then you couldn't go out; and reading books can become boring after a while, and maybe there was nothing on tv for you to watch. But when computers and internet cameout, people sould play games, watch videos, and talk to cousins or family who live far away. Computers are also good for social networks. Not all familys live close, but are a close family. But in this ec onomy we can't always afford to visit them whenever. So by using computers we can @CAPS1 them facebook them, ,myspace them, and even video chat with them, which as I said is great far away family. But at times people can become to obsesed with them. Some people spend all day on one website, particulary facebook or youtube. Do not get me wrong, these websites are fun and cool. But not cool enough to not go outside and have free, natural fun. I remember I logged into facebook and saw a girl on, I logged off around an hour later and she was still on, then I logged in again around @TIME1 and the same girl was on!

1075,"Dear readers, I right to you today about the effects of computer usage. I feel that there are some positive and some negative effects from using the computer. You can talk to people, and you can get work done, but if you are at this to much you'll be starting to gain bad health and miss other things in life. Throughout the computer, there is many ways to communicate with others, which is an amazing thing. Whether it be through a game, typing or real chatting, it's very important to talk to people and this makes things much easier than going out nad talking to people face to face. For, example penpals, over the years people have written letters to their penpals, but know you can send it over mail and email doesn't cost any money, just type up your letter click a button and done. Another positive point about computers is that you're able to get work done on it. From work for a business to school work, it doesn't matter. You bear of people using computers to do work all of the time. Why do you think there are computer labs at school or desks with computers in offices. Computers have become advanced and the easiest thing to get things done with. Presentations, essays, graphs, anything. A concern I have of the computer is that people are becoming to addicted to computers. Many younger people are overusing computers wich leads to bad health. When people sit in front of a computer screen all day only getting up to grab something to eat, people will because obese. To stall healthy people need to be outside and exercise. We need to make rules to keep people out in the open out to give the generation a healthy life. So, I have mixed feelings about computers. They can be amazing for a while but only for a while.

My reasons being people are spending to much time on their computers, less time exercising, and lose interacting with family and friends. My first reason why i think computers are bad for our society is people are spending to much time on them. I know when i get home from school the computer is all i can think about until i go on. It's like an addiction. People spend all their time on a social net work other then going out and meeting new people. My second reason is people spend less time exercising. Ive been over a friends house before, and all we did was play computer games instead of enjoying nature outside. Alot of @CAPS1 don't make healthy food choices, so why not go out and exercise? It's because of the computer. Ive seen my little brother spend his whole saterday eating in front of the computer and playing games. It's just unhealthy. My last and final reason is it takes time away from family and friends ive spent my whole day after school in my room on the computer. It's like when your on the computer nothing else matters because you think ""hey why not just talk to my friends over @CAPS2, or myspce, or facebook! you lose a lot of friendships like this. Also you lose friendship with you family because you badly talk to them while your on the computer. Half the time im to busy talking to someone i don't know then helping my little brother with home work, or helping my mom clean the house. In conclusion these are my three reasons why i think the computer is bad for sivilization. I really hope you take all this into consideration and really think what the computer can do to @CAPS1 I people once again those three resons are one, people are spending to much time on their computer. Two, spend less time exercising. Three, lose interactions with family and friends.",4,4,0

I like it because I have @CAPS2 relatives who live far away and I use my computer to comunicate with them from time to time. Skype is my favorite, I can see the person @CAPS8 talking to at the same time. Also computers can be good for business for large companies who need to comunicate out of the contry. I'm sure being a amazing newspaper company, you could use a way of easy comunication. finally, comunication with friends. These are @CAPS2 programs for this, @CAPS9 @CAPS1 facebook and myspace. This is why a computer is a good way of comunication. finally, computers can be useful for schools and work. You can type a paper or news article on the computer. It's much faster than writing. Also, @CAPS10 you need more info on something, you could look it up online. like @CAPS10 you are writing an article on dolphins, you could learn more about them. In conclusion I think computers are good things. They help with everyday life, They are good for comunication. And last they help at school or work.",4,5,0
364,"You've got mail! @CAPS1 my computer which is filled with emails from distant relatives and friends. Without computers, I would not be able to keep in touch with these people as efficiently as I can with computers. In the past few decades, technology has been drastically advancing, resulting in the incredible computers, with computers we can type faster, communicate with distant relatives, and find information like ever before. Because of this incredible invention, computers have allowed us to do @LOCATION1 things that are truly astonishing. To begin, we have thrown away typr writers and purchased computers. Now like never before, we can type faster, improve hand eye cordination, and edit our papers without the help of a peer. First of all, with the extreene amounts of typing needed for colleges, most occupations, and everyday list, computers have made this faster and easier process. I am sure most of the things you have to type for @LOCATION1 are written using a computer. Secondly we have gained amazing hand-eye cordination skills. Furthermore, be typing and reading at the same time, we have trained or eyes to do many @LOCATION1 things similar to playing the piano. Lastly, now with spell check, we are able to edit papers without using someone elses help! The computer can sense problems in an instant, which is even more effective without a doubt, the typing documents aspect of computers is @CAPS5 one reason why we need them around. Another reason is because of communication. Thanks to many @LOCATION1 communication applications such as @ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3, we can now communicate with a surplus of distant friends and relatives. For example, with both my sisters at college it was hard for me to communicate with them however, due to @CAPS2, I can see their pictures, instant message them, and even video chat! Without computers, being able to see their pictures and what they are up to would have never been possible. Secondly, email has created a fast, easy way to update people on schedule changes, ideas and even sales and specials offered by stores! Snail mail is no more with this extreemly efficient way of communication! Clearly, the communication aspect of computers is an explicit reason why we need them in our lives. Last but not least, computers have allowed us to access information like never before. We can now find facts and figures, faster, easier, and with hundreds more optinions, within seconds, thanks to @ORGANIZATION1 and other search engines, we can find the information we need. Not to mention, the process is exceedingly @CAPS5 type in exactly what you are looking for and you will be brought to exactly what you need! Thirdly, there is many more options and sites to choose from. For example, if you were to type in a certain animal there would be an overdose of pages pertaining to your topic. Now, it is possible to find exactly what you are looking for! There is no question that computers have made searching for information easier and faster, which is exactly why we need them in our everyday lives. Conclusively, computers are an astonishing invention that has opened @LOCATION1 doors for today's society. Without computers we would not be able to type documents as quickly, communicate, and find information in a fashion. However, because of this invention, computers have allowed us to do incredible things. People all across the country are expenencing the efficiency of using computers and now we can to! It is evident, that computers are effective, and are advancing technology in our society.",6,5,1
1597,"North @CAPS1 courier, I would like to give you my opinion on the usage of computers. I am a person who supports the advances in technology and believe computers have a positive effect on people, @CAPS2 ran benefit people in many ways. The three most important ways to me is that @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, gives people another source to retain knowledge from, and lastly @CAPS2 realise to another way for people communicate. Hand-eye coordination is an awesome skill to have in our society. In a country, being the @LOCATION2, that revolves around sports, hand-eye coordination really helps out. Using the computers really helps harness and train your hand-eye for sports such as baseball, basketball and many more. Using the computers for hand-eye coordination will really help the @LOCATION2 to develop some world class athletes. We also live in a country where their are so many drivers and cars on the road. We have a problem with bad drivers here in the @LOCATION2 so if they improve their coordination maybe the numbers of car accidents and fatalities involving automobile will decreas. Well how in computers help with with hand-eye coordination yoe ask? I'll tell you how, by people using fun gaming sites, like luniosity.com, which is a website with games for brain training. @CAPS2 helps with hand-eye coordination, concentration, memorization, and problem solving. They help your brain in all of these categories just by having cute and fun little game. As you can see in the @LOCATION2 we need improved hand-eye coordination and @CAPS2 could do many positive things for the country. We cam improve @CAPS2 just by computer. To retain knowledge about other cultures, places, people and miscellaneous things makes to amazing thanks to the computer we have for this information besides books. have the internet and computers you can know about what you want when you type in the subject into a search engine like google or yahoo. People can learn all of this wonderful and interesting information about things they of never known before. @CAPS2 also helps kids like to find information for reports and. There are truly you can learn on the internet. You can learn about or. Maybe the difference between an element and a compound, or even just the definition of the word sucess than is a to @LOCATION1. You can get so much knowledge from the computers/internet. Communication is another huge part of our daily lives. Most people have home phones or call phones, but for the ones who dont they need as meen of communication. On the computer you can use instant @CAPS3 or email; @CAPS4 twitter, or myspace as well. The computer gives people who don't have phones another way to communicate with others. Even if you do have a phone and someone you known is overseas. Instead of wasting money on a long distances just use one of the systems y've mentioned. The same thing goes for our military, they don't have phones to call home so they communicate via the computer. Communicating via computer is just another reason why the computer is so important. So as I conclude my letter to you, the north @CAPS1 courier, I shall restate that I do support technology because they do have positive effects on people. The positive effects that are the most major are @CAPS2 teaches hand-eye coordinating helps people with another source to gain knowledge, and lastly @CAPS2 allows another way to communicate with people. I will tell you once again computers benefits society and do have positive effects.",6,5,1
979,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, Computers can be a great asset to our society, but they are an even, bigger hindrance. People are wasting their days away on the computer. Hardly anyone goes out in exercise, or to enjoy nature. Perhaps the sea west effect is that hardly anyone interacts with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you with their friends and family anymore. @CAPS2 you don't want to surromb to the computers. put down the mouse and go outside! Obesity in @LOCATION1 is at an all time high. Experts agree, that computers and other types of technology are to blame. People who spend a lot of time on the computer hardly ever exercise and that effects them negatively. These people have a shorter lifespan! They might not be around in twenty years to see their grand children grown up. Also, they have many medical problems. @PERSON1, an obesity expert, says, ""I have seen a positive correlation with the obesity rate and that of @CAPS1."" @CAPS1 can kill you! Obesity can also cause heart attacks and infertility! @CAPS2 you can avoid these diseases and health risks by getting off the computer, why wouldn't you? Using the computer is not a good price to pay for you health! Do you have fond childhood memories that involve nature? I know I do. Most people who spend too much time on the computer don't get the chance to make memories like that. Theyre too preoccupied with the computer to care. Many people won't ever see any of our national parks! Drew @PERSON2, a park ranger, says. ""In the past few years. we have had less visitors than ever before."" @CAPS2 people can't tear themselves away from the computer for even a minute to see the splendor of our national, there is obviously something wrong. Get off you computers and go outside! I share everything with my friends and family and try to spend as much time with them as possible. Almost all people who use the computer often say @PERCENT1 of the time, they use it as an excuse not to see friends and family. In reality, they don't want to leave it. As a society, we are becoming too dependent on technology supervisor says. ""I have seen as definite decline in family enrollment. We hardly ever see kids with friends and family hanging around"". She is right. Now is the time to stop using computers! Computers @MONTH1 not be totally to blame for the problems stated above. Maybe it's the people a though computers do contribute to the problem. @CAPS2 we didn't have computers, there would be more people out exercising, and enjoying nature. Memories would be when we hung around with friends and family. Now is the time to turn of the computer, and go outside. Call up a friend and take a stroll, @CAPS3 you do, know you can have fun withour computers.",5,5,1
651,"@ORGANIZATION1, @DATE1, people have been doing less exercise and not enjoying the great outdoors. They're some people that are having less family and friends times. I say its computers!"" This machine is a great resource, but people are starting to get adicted to it. We need to reach a messgae to those people. Yesterday, I went to my local library and found @NUM1 computers in the library. All of the computers were filled with people and, a line with @NUM2 people ready to go on next. I ask those @NUM2 people ""why were they there?"" ""for homework"" said a teenager. Another, ""just to come and paly"". I also ask, ""how do they stay fit?"" ""I don't like @CAPS1 fit"" said beautiful lady. ""@CAPS1 fit isn't esay if your always on the computer"" said the teenager. The response I got from those people, were unbelievable. If we don't stay fit how are we going to survivie from all these dieases and cancer. This reason has pently to do witj not @CAPS1 fit. I don't know about you but I care about my family, I would never spend the rest of my life infront of a computer instead of my love ones. In the of , I was surprise to find out that projects, homework and research can take up half of your time, with your family. Do the computer, you can find some resort for you and your friends and fanily, you can't be doing for more than minutes. The great out doors should be one of the best places to be. because it quit, its amazing and its a large area.

1557,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 tired, lazy people sitting on their computer and wasting their life bacause of it. The issue to with is do you think that people are spending to much time on the computer or not. I strongly believe that people are spending to much time on the computer. And, here are @CAPS2 reasons why, people are spending less time exercising, people not enjoying nature, and less time interacting with family and friends. Without a doubt you probably know that exercising is at least somewhat helpful to life, @CAPS4 if people are sitting home @NUM1 on the computer with no exercise, it is going to cause people to gain an excess amount of wait. Because the more they just sit around. And do nothing except the computer. The more they're going to be and the more lazy they're going to be. So they're not going to want to do anything and really it's just a waist of life. And, in some cases it can cause depression. Just ask a local resident who says "" @CAPS2 mom used to be on the computer all the time and did nothing with her life,"" and @CAPS3 she became depressed. And, soon after, killed herself."" @CAPS3 more and more people are going to become like. I know that a lot of people like to be outside when its a nice sunny day. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 somebody on that day in a room, with their eyes to the computer screen. Because they cant think of anything else to do with their lives. @CAPS4 @CAPS1 if that was someone you loved. Doing that with their life. I'm pretty sure you would try to do something to help them get off that path. Just ask another local resident @PERSON1 who says, ""I remember coming home everyday, and there was @CAPS2 mom, no shades up, pitch block, it was like a dark cave, and she would sit there for hours on the computer wasting her life, and I remember asking her how long has it been since you've gone outside, she answered, its been almost two months."" @CAPS4 I know from @CAPS2 family that there was a family member of mine who was a ""computer junkie"" And, I remember at a family get together @CAPS2 aunt was the only one who could never come.

1687,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers have really made an impact on society. Some people, think they have made a good impact while others think the opposite. I believe that they are a good thing in our lives and have made a drastic, but great impact. Some reasons that support my opinion are that computers are basically what helps us keep in touch with people, they make it very easy to find needed information and they make our school lives faster and much simpler. First of all, computers are pretty much how people keep in touch. There are many ways you can keep in touch over computers. Tere is video-chatting, e-mail and chat websites such as @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 etc. There are many people that really enjoy having the ability to keep in touch this way. It is a step up from talking on the phone. On the computer if you are web-chatting, you can not only talk to them, but you can see them! When it comes to chatting websites such as @CAPS2, there are millions of people who belong to this incredible website and love it. Kids and adults really enjoy having access to something like this. For me, since I moved to @STATE1 and had to leave all my friends behind, the computers has saved some of my relationships that I thought I would lose but didn't want to. I can e-mail my friends, and even see what they look like and how much they have changed on @CAPS2. Computers are a very helpful piece of technology that have helped me, and so many other people keep in touch. Another important reason computers are a wonderful technology item is because they make it so easy to find needed information. From what a word means, to the directions to get to @LOCATION1, the computer can help with all of this. I talked to my mom and she said. ""Computers just make @CAPS6 all of the information I need to knew about your brother's diabetes so easy."" @CAPS6 information in books can take so long. You have to go to the library or a bookstore, find the book you need with the correct information, and then you have to read through the whole book to find the information needed. On a computer, you can just google what you need to find, and read the article or map, etc. Computers have made @CAPS6 information a breeze and everyone loves how simple it is! The last reason that supports my opinion is that computers make our school lives faster and much simpler to deal with. In school, there are times when we need to write a very lengthy composition, and it will take forever to write. With a computer, typing up the composition would probably take around half the time of writing the composition. I took a survey of three kids that typed a composition and three kids that wrote it. I asked each of the kids how long it took them. The kids that wrote the paper said it took them around two hours. The kids that typed the composition said it took them around an hour. Also, when things are typed, they are usually easier to read which makes it easier for teachers to grade, and won't take as long. Computers make school easier for students and teachers. The opinion that computers are not a benefit to society just doesn't make sense. Yes, I know that there can be some disadvantages. But think of all the advantages compared to the disadvantages. There are a lot more good than bad things. Without computers, people would be incredibly stressed, and have a hard time making life easier. Computers are an amazing benefit to society. Everyone should agree with this because people stayin touch because of computers, computers make it very easy to find information that needed, and they make our school lives aint easier and faster for students and teachers. Computers have made an extremely large impact and changed our ways of life for the better!",5,5,1
934,"Dear @CAPS1, I strongly believe computers have positive effects on people and the society. My reasons are you can learn and find new information on anything, you are able to talk to people faraway and computers teach skills to use in the future. I will now like to elaborate my reasons further. First of all, going on the internet and search sites help you learn and find information on anything you want. On the internet you can even ask questions, and they will probably be answered. You my even use information on the computer for a report statistics show @PERCENT1 of people who do reports, find their facts on the internet. Google, yahoo, and other search sites have helped children become more intrested in learning. Also, using a computer ables you to talk to other people from faraway places or friends you have not seen in a while. You can even webcam with people. I remember a few weeks ago, my best friend moved to florida, and now we webchat everyday! Talking online will even lower your telephone bills. Chatting online doesn't lost anything, where as the telephone charges for out of country calls cost . Computers will let you talk with your best buddy and save money. Last but not least, computers teach skills that can be applied later in life. Today many jobs in due using a computer, and technology is getting mom advanced. Before you know it will have to know how to work a computer. Also, you probably will need a computer in college. Proffesor @CAPS2 even stated, ""every single kid in my courses have some sort of computer."" In college you will take notes and do assignments. Using computers will help you do this and make your life easier. As you can see i believe computers help people and society greatly. My reasons are you can learn and find information on anything, you are able to talk to other people who are faraway, and computer skills will help you in life. Technology is advancing and were going to have to use a computer sooner or later.",4,4,0
74,"I believe that computers have good effects on people. Computers allow people to stay in touch with long distance friends or family. Computers have games for kids that help them learn, and, also, people learn new things, too. My first reason is that, computers allow people to stay in touch. If someone in their family live long distance then they could always use e-mails to talk. That way they wont lose each other. Also, sometimes, friends move away and you always want to keep in touch. Another thing is that, if they want to send photos to each other, they can use e-mail. Also, because, thru an mail takes forever. Please, let the people stay in touch! My second reason is that, computers has games kids play. The games kids play could help them learn more. Sometimes watching t.v. don't help. If they acutually play the game and see what their doing, then they will got smarter. That's what we want for our kids, right? Also, kids have fun playing these games. Do you really want to take the learning experience away? My third reason is, computers help people learn new things. Like, they could go on the computer and learn what's happening in the world. People can learn new words they never knew about. Also, pictures on the computer help, too. For example, if someone is traveling somewhere, and they don't know how the price. They can get on the computer and check it out, right? So, in conclusion, I believe that computers are good use. They help people stay in touch, help kids learn by playing games and help people learn new things about the world and more. So, I'm saying, please, keep the computers. They are not a waste of our time. Turst me!",4,3,0

Computer make @CAPS14 easier to learn about area that are hard to research like @PERSON1 and cliff of the @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1, @CAPS6 to learn about history of an area or cities of ancient @CAPS7 like @ORGANIZATION1 in @LOCATION2 of @CAPS5.

I think they are very good to have because you can use them for emailing, jobs, and schoolwork. This is why I think having a computer is a good things what do you think? As I was say computers are good for emailing, even I.ming. lets say you play baseball and you forgot what time your game is. You can just push that power button and tree to your coach asking what time you need to be at the feild. Also theres I.Ming, its wen you can talk to your friends online its a great way to comunicate and meet new people. Emailing is great, its so hi-tect you can email one of your family members who live thousand miles away from you. I once did that my aunt's lisa was in florida and i asked her to send me pictures of the water and the beaches and she did, they were eye catching. Next reason why computers are good to have is for jobs. In todays world everything is ran by computers for example each registers. A.T.M. and car are ran off of computers. So having it for a job is great. Lets your tells you to fax over a copy can do it the computer within a minute i know my dads job requires of he keeps it all to his witch on his desktop on his laptop. This is why most jobs have computers. Do you are one? Lastly, school was computers . For example my teacher on his computer atendence, homework and . If he didn't have that, he would be lost. Its also good for the kids too. Every week in social studies we have to look up the presidents and i use my laptop for that. Did you know is a program were you can look at your grades and missing assignments? It's call power school. Computers are great for school. I think every one should have one. So what do you think about them? Are they amazing or what? I think are very helpful because you can use them for emailing, working, and school work. If it wasn't for computers we would really know as much as we do now. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1.T have them. Computers are gonna help you through life alot, welcome to the real world.",5,4,1
513,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing this letter on behalf of all the busy people in our country. We have come to the conclusion that we need, not want, but need computers in our life. First, we need them to communicate to other people. Second, we need computers to do research for school and work. Lastly, us kids need computers to type essays, prompts, or papers for each class. Communication is very important in everyday life. For instance, I have a grandma that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see her once or twice a year in person. Throughout the entire year, I video chat with her through @CAPS3 computer because it is a whole lot easier than flying there. Without computers to video chat with @CAPS3 grandma, I have no communication with her they one or two times a year. Using a computer for communication is extremly helpful it allows you to do so many things without travelling for, like video chatting. Another reason why computers are a neccessity in our is because reseach for and easier. Many kids nowadays have so much homework and spend on the internet. For I myself, that I. The internet is a quick way to get the reseach. Plus, the research I have found is just as accurate as a book from a library. Computers are absolutly needed when kids have a load of homework and projects that need to be researched. Thinks when the time a to, kids have to type up essays and prompts that its unimaginable. Just in the @DATE1 I had to type on english, essay and a fluently paragraph. Final grade @CAPS2 I did not type it, on a computer. Typing things on the computer cames out of school also, whole @CAPS3 dad is frequently typing up and he is also typing up essays for his company. Many things nowadays in order to be perfect, have to be written up on the computer or you will not get the result you were hoping for. In conclusion, computers are modern devices and you are going to have to live with it. Computers provide great communication with everyone around or even across the country. Also, they make research for school become a lot more efficent. Finally, computers type papers and essays up faster. Computers are a neccessity for living.",4,4,0
1495,"Dear @CAPS1, I agree with the experts that people spend to much time on the computer, people should be exercising, reading, or spending time with friends and family. But people are so lazy and would rather be sitting and doing something on the computer and if they dont start doing other things instead of being online they could become overweight. My first reason why people should spend less time online is because people need to exercize. Seriously people should be taking walks around the block or going to the gym or even playing a sport instead of playing on the computer all day and doing nothing and without exercising you will become overweight and lazy. My second reason why I think people should spend less time online is because you should be spending time with your friends and family not ignoring them because your doing something on the computer. Thats just rude, so why dont you go and have a family game night or go out to eat with your family and you could also watch a movie, go skating, or even go to the park with your friends because thats a lot more fun than being online all day. My last reason why people should spend less time online is because everyone should have time to just read a good book honestly just walk down to your local library and check out a book because reading is way better for your brain than doing stupid stuff on the computer. So in conclusion, in my opinion I think people should spend less time online is because if you dont get enough exercize you can become over weight and lazy, and not spending a lot of time with your friends and family is just rude and reading is very good for you unlike staying on the computer, well that is all I have to say for now.",4,4,0

Each day new discoverys are benefiting our society however they are only being made possible by the help of computers. Without computers some for dieseases would have never been discovered and more people. Would have died. Secondly, computers have also increased medical care and have been the cave between life or death. Finnaly, computers help speed up production rates of cars household neccessitys, and many more objects. Have you ever been bored at home and looking for something to do on that dark, rainy, chilly night? Yes, exactly what I thought well the new technology advances in social-networking can even help the most bored and lonelyest people and give them something to do. Even if your just looking to talk to someone you can easily do that on the internet. So you people out there looking for that special someone will always be able to look somewhere. With all the social networks like twitter, myspace, facebook, and youtube you will always have something to do. During this economic recestion it seems that finding a job is so hard, however the internet comes to the rescue yet again. The internet can help you find a job twice if not three times as fast. Many people also speed up their word by using the computer. With microsoft things are lot easier to do work that you need to make up I hope that everyone can understand how much the computer help you, rather then hurt you. @CAPS1 of the newspaper, I hope you and the rest of the community can see that computer help you more that they hurt you.

The more time spent has on a computer, the less time a person has to do something active, like exercising @PERCENT1 of people spend more than @NUM1 @NUM2 hours on the computer per day, if @NUM3 or so hours were used to exercise or play a sport that number would decrease to @PERCENT2 according to a recent study.

If we want to become a healthier country, we should state @CAPS5 writing time spent on computers. Also kids now stay up later on computers and lower then grades @CAPS5 doing so.

If a family member spends all their time on the computer, the other family members will have less of a relationship with them because they don't talk or do anything together an dwill likely not know what is going on i their life or if something is wrong. As you can tell, computers also have a negative effect on relationships with family and friends. The overuse of computers does nnot benefit society. They affect a persons activity level, students grades and most importantly a persons realtionships with family and friends. In oredr to ake our country a better and healthier place, we must the time spent on computers.""",6,6,1
263,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 minute of the day - millions of computer users around the world hop onto their laptops or desktops, but is it always a good thing? The question has been raised if people spending alot of time on computers is a bad thing. Computers are a bad thing because people spend too much time on them and lose quility time with friends and family. The dangers of online interaction, and the risk of having your information stolen. Countless people around the world face these problems everyday and computer usage should be lessened. Whether teens, kids, or adults are gaming, on websites or typing essays people around the world spend way too much time on their computers. For example, of the @PERCENT1 of people who have computers with online access @PERCENT2 of them spend @NUM1 hours a day on them. This is about @NUM2 billion hours of computer usage around the world. Children and adults alike have lost face time or interraction with other human beings face to face. Before computers kids played outside running and playing around. While in present day less than @PERCENT3 of all children get at least one hour of time outside. Computers are not a bad thing, but its is when they are over used they become hurtful to kids health. These facts have not just contributed, but they are almost the cause of obesity in the world. Computer usage needs to be cut down to size if we are to solve these problems. The additon of online chat to computers has not only increased computer usage but doubled it. The invention of @CAPS2, and instant messaging was never meant to be a bad thing, but it sure did turn into one. Online chat allows people to send hatefull and vulgar messages to their enemys without showing their face. In some cases some teens were harrased online so bad they committed suicide. Another bad thing about @CAPS2, or @CAPS3 is that dangerous criminals can hide behind their computers and lure children or teens to a meeting place where they can be kidnapped. @NUM3 out of @NUM4 users of online chat was lured by a criminal to a "" meeting place"" and was kidnapped and never seen against last year. Most of these victims do not return or are found. Although the invention of chat online was meant as quick easy communication it became a horror crime in most cases. Millions even billions of dollars have been stolen by internet hackers. These hackers break the security codes and buy things online using other peoples money. Four out five people admit to having multiple sites with personal information on them and @NUM5 out of those four people have had at least one account hacked. This problem continues to grow and hackers feed off of weak sites. If this problem continues to grow the whole world will be bankrupt. These hackers know who you are, your family, your personal information, and where you live. Internet usage needs to be cut down to sites. If we do not then usage will increase, there will be no chat problems and peoples money will get stolen.",5,5,1
1362,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1't you agree that computers should be limited or often not used? Recently, it has been brought to my attention that computers have a negative effect on society. Without a doubt, I firmly believe that computers should be a hobby not an addiction. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising and interacting with family and friends. Most teenagers are involved with cyber-bullying which takes place on computers. People spend to much time on their computers and less time exercising. I can remember when my step mom @PERSON1 was a size six in the waist. @PERSON1 would exercise everyday after work for two hours. This all changed when my dad bought her a lime green, @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 laptop for her birthday. @PERSON1 quickly became addicted to @CAPS3 (computer game) and began to cut down on her exercising routines. Six months later, when she went to a doctor's appointment she found out that she gained more than ten pounds. @PERSON1 is now a size fourteen in waist. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of people gain weight because they cut down on exercising so they can have more computer time. Most people spend to much time on their computers and less time interacting with family and friends. This reminds me of my step dad @PERSON4. When @PERSON4 gets home from work he usually goes straight to the computer instead of having a conversation with the rest of the family. He gets angry when @PERSON2 (@NUM1 years old) bothers him because he wants to play. @PERSON4 is usually online. From three o'clock till ten o'clock playing chess with strangers from all over. What he doesn't know is that while he is building relationships with strangers he is breaking the bond between him and his loved ones. @PERCENT2 of teenagers are involved with cyber bullying. This reminds me of my cousin @PERSON3. Last @DATE1, @PERSON3 became a member of @CAPS4 @CAPS2, iTrouble quickly began to find her. In other words, girls from ages thirteen to twenty began to send her threatening messangers. No later than a day when @PERSON3 was walking down the street a gang of girls jumped her. However, she survived the brutal attack and deleted her @CAPS4 account. In conclusion, without a doubt, I firmly believe that people shouldn't spend to much time on computers. My three arguments are cyber-bullying, less exercise and less interaction with family and friends, @CAPS7 take my suggestion seriously and bann computers.",5,4,1

They should only spend a certain amount of time on them and not all day. Many people are spending more than enough time on the computer People ran often stay on the computer for hours and not even relize it, they stay up all @TIME1 doing work, or playing games. @TIME1 a while it will eventually take a toll on the body. Because @CAPS2 you are on the machine all day then you are using little to no energy at all. So then you spend @CAPS1 nights in bed tossing and turning. Then that leeds to feelings horrible in the @TIME2, @CAPS2 you do it @TIME1 it is going to have a bad effect on your body. I believe that people who spend all their time on the computer will eventually get overweight. @CAPS2 you are sitting in a chair all day then you get no exercise what so ever. Then when you eat you don't burn off the calories so that leeds to people gaining wait and becoming over wait from that your body becomes very unhealthy and will most likely leed to health issues. When people are on the computer they end up ignoring nature. They miss out on being in the wonderful warmth of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, or going out and playing in the snow and making @CAPS5, forts, or having a @CAPS6 fight. They even miss out on just going outside and talking a walk the reason is because they are @CAPS7 @CAPS8 inside their house with their fare glued to the computer. Being on the computer takes a lot out on the body. It can cause health problems and even problems in general. So people should just spend a part of their day on the computer. The other part of the day they should be outside, walking around, maybe playing with pets, children or friends.

Im going to explane why within the most few paragraphs. First I would like to start off by saying its good that people are into computers and working with them because that books their learning activities and they learn new thinngs and it will help them be sucessfull in life, people play games, cross word puzzles, riddles, and many more. Same use the internet for ingredence, car parts, ect. Next, useing computers is very helpful to the human race because it will effect students school, parents/guardians/teens. It will effect and lots of schools are useing computers now and exspecialy students to do their. It effects parents, beca use it will sucess them in life and help them find jobs, with their jobs. Finally their getting enuff exercise because their going to bed, their eating, they go to school, work, or do something for the day that involves walking. Nobody just sits home and does nothing those days. Theirs always something to do or a place to go. Well I hope you think about what I told you and take it into consideration.

148,"I belive that computers benifit our society for many reasons. Computers have been around for many years now and everywere you go you usualy see one. That must meen people love then. These are so many uses and fun expeirences you can have with a computer. Computers make people happy and that makes for a better society because it is happier. they make people happy because you can play games like tetris, @CAPS1, and even cards. Compuer games make people happy because when ever they are bored and does nothing going on you can hop on the computer and play a game. Some of the awsome games featured on a computer are @CAPS1, cards, pinball and other great game. The computer makes for a happier home because as soon as kids get home from school they use it for games or chat with freinds. Another reason computers benifit society is because you can now pay bills and buy hings from the internet. When you pay bills or buy things over the internet have is no need to go out and waste money on gas so it makes people very happy when hey save money. It also saves on polution because if a car isn't going out there is less so computers are also saving society as well. My last reason that computers benifit society is they can make you smarter and make you do better in school by learning about often people or cultures. For example on my last research project for social studies I used the computer and got an A. this made me happy so in effect it makes society happy. Now you have my reasons why computers benifit the society. They make us happy, made us smarter, and make us a better society for it. I love computers and everybody else should too.",5,4,1

People say advances in technology believe that computers have an effect on people in such a way of saying. Many people showed on as is say can use the computers but to remember to think about nature what nice things it has in store for us. Im going to saying that experts are right that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Im thinking that in some points many family members and friends see then other relative person on companion so much on the computers it's like if they are thinking maybe they don't care anymore. Caring about nature and your loved ones is such a great thing. @PERCENT1 of my friends agree with me when I say that people should be less on electronic devices because that can effect your brain or maybe your eye sight (eye vision.) @CAPS1 more and more people should lay off it. @PERSON1 of yale university has conducted extensive reaserch and proven that many computers that are being used by people can be damage of using it every time. I strongly agree with him that there should be a time limit on something to let them later on have the spaare time to enjoy and have fun with nature but something different such as to enjoy listening to soft music. I know you will agree with me when I say that maybe people should spend less time effecting themselves.

1472,"Dear @CAPS1, The computers that are being used, do have a positive effect on people. For example, there's better communication with friends and family, you get instant news on any topic, and you get advanced education. Imagine if no important business was trying to be in contact with you by cell phone, but you missed the call. No worries the person no contact you by a simple email. Computers are also a positive effect because if you have a facebook, or other interacting werbsites, you know what's going on in your friends life all the time without having the to by reaching them all the to see how they are doing.

An example to support my reason is that people from all parts of the world have families different places. And they cannot have a good contack with them. But if they go on the internet they could their friends and families and chat with them. This shows that if you live in the @LOCATION2 and you have a friends that live in @LOCATION1 you could have a with I have families that lives and @LOCATION1 and it is hard to them. But when I am on the computer I can chat with them and have a fun time. This shows that you need a computer to catch up with friends and family. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Second of all why you should believe that computers have a positive effect on people is that computers helps you learn more about different parts of the world. An example is that if you don't know anything about a country or a place you could go on the internet a research and learn more about that place. This shows that computers is important to have. Another example is that when I have a project or a essay and I don't know about it. I could go on the computer and look it up. And by doing this it will help me on my project or essay. That's why I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Finally why I believe so is that computers helps you understand and learn more about life. An example is that if you don't know if something is right or wrong you could look it up and it @MONTH1 help you. This shows that computers can give advices. Another example is that computers could give you an idea on what to do. If you are trying a new resipie and you are not sure on @CAPS3 to make it.

There is also websites that can show you how to move yor hands when using a computer. Well when kids come from school always have homework, @CAPS2 you need to do it on the comptuer so if you couldn't use computers it would be hard for kids to do there homework. So when they go to school and the class tells the teacher they dont have computers what are they going to do. So when I get out of school and I had a very long day. I go home do my homework and go on the computer and listen to music to relax. If you guy were to take computers away every one would be grumpy all the time.

I believe computers are good thing, but only if they are used properly. Hopefully when I'm done, you'll see where I'm coming from on this matters. Everyone is on the computer these days. The problem is, many people are on way too much. They say they are working on hand-eye coordination, but in reality they are wasting away their lives on a chair. They do not communicate as much with the rest of the household and that does not make a big, happy family. They say they are getting important information, but in truth, they might just be getting false information and viruses. Bad people are out there, and one might hack into your computer and ruin your day. Things like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 could have people that want to find out all about you so they can hurt you. Yes, being on the computer definitely has a bad side. But there is a good side as well. That is, as long as you are not on too much.

Our society has been around computers so often that some peole will find it hard to even live without them. Computers have become something that people depend on. This, however, is something to take as a concern. when people are dependent on computers too much, they loose valuble skills that the once possesed and they spend less time, outside exercising while also loossing touch with famly and friends. It has become near that computers have become along part of peoples lives. Computers posses the ability to do certain human tasks that seem hard for us to do. Before the computer age, it was a lot more difficult to find information on a topic or place. We used to have to use encyclopedias or find books on those topics. Sometimes we would even have to travel to a place and learn about it. Today, however, people use technology to find this information. You @MONTH1 be thinking, "" @CAPS3, how is this a bad thing?"". The reason it is a problem is because people have begun to loose the ability to use books like encylopedias and atleses or even simmple maps. Once, most of the population could use these tools to help find their way through information or a place. I know from experienc, that I can barley look at a map and find where I am. We have become too dependent on @CAPS4's and computers, which in turn makes us forget valuble information. What would happen if someone got lost and they didn't have a working @CAPS4 or signal on their phones. They would get lost and not know how to read a map. As you can see the human population has because too dependent on computers. Additionally, people all around the world have become addicted to the internet. Facebook, @CAPS6 and even @CAPS7 baseball have become an addicting activity that people consume all of their time with. When people begin to spend hte majority of their time on these websites, they will in turn get less excersise, and become more distant from family and friends. Mostly teenagers have this problem. If you took a survay of the number of students who have a facebook account or @CAPS6, you would probably get the majority. Having an account like this is said to be addicting. Students, parents and everyone in between will find troubles later on because of this. America is one of the leading nations with obesity. Has anyone stopped to think that maybe people spend too much time on these websites to get any excersise? If the internet wasn't such a big thing it is now, I bet you there would be less overweight people. but not only do people become overweight, they will end up more and more distant from family and friends. My own sister spends so much time on her laptop that my parents had to take it away. Once, the only way for us to really talk to her through facebook. As you can see, computers can be a dangerous thing. think of all the people who you know that spend multiple hours on the computer. You can probably thnks of quiet a few. Computers are an addicting thing that can cause less excersising and less communication which is proven to support a healthy life style. Also when people use computers too much, they loose valueble skills. Remember this next time you are someone you know sits down at a computer for a long time. You can help them.",5,6,1

Amny @CAPS5 are becoming to on computers. So in my question I believe computers have a neagtiove on. First of all computers have caused @CAPS5 to not exercise and become unhealthy. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 @CAPS5 have said they are their @CAPS5 are spending to each time on the computer. @CAPS5 need to realize that sitting on a computer @CAPS4 is a danger to their health you don't want you @CAPS5 to have eye problems in the do you? To the to be on the computer to much and just for work, but for playing games I realize enough I need to stop and go out and exercise to keep well-balanced health @PERSON1 says, ""@CAPS4 technology increases the more and more people we have given glasses too."" @CAPS5 need to make changes to what they do during the. So @CAPS4 I somputers because @CAPS5 are not become unhealthy. My people do not spend @CAPS4 much time with family and friends. In the pase my mon used to yell at me. @PERCENT1 of people believe is very important did you know that. Computers keep your divorce could have from computer. People need to within families because it decrease interaction with. My last reason is that people are not. @NUM4 ot of @NUM3 people enjoying nature you a chance to express your thought. Many people need time to think about what is happening in their life and they cannot do this our internet. TO the past stressed because I never had a to just relax and think about things I computer doing something or homework. @PERCENT2 of people who have to much going life believe that they. Do you now see that nature can be helpful? So @CAPS4 you can see computers have a negative effect because people don't get enough time to enjoy nature.

So I strongly you to vote being a negative effect.",5,5,1
1479,"My oponion is computers should be used for many different purpuses. One reason is chating online with friends and family. Another reason is that if you are going far away and you know someone that can give you directions to where you are going then you can chat with them as they give you directions to where them as they give you directions to where your heading. Another reason is if you have family that does not live with you and you can't go an see them then you can chat with them. Another rwson is that of your going somewhere and you don't know the weather for the next day then you can go online and find out what's the weather for that day. Also if people really want to exercise then they can go on there computer and go to youtube and od exercise from there computer. Also if you want to see the @CAPS1 then you can search it on your computer to see what's going on. Lastly if you don't think it's rite for people to have computers then you should try to get one to see how much stuff you can do with it. You will be amazed. This is my reason why people should have computers to enjoy while chating, watching @CAPS1 and many other stuff that you can't probably imagine. Also, maybe kids should not have computers but they can get one when they get older. Also, if kids need to search from school then they can also do that there are many reasons why people should get computers. That my my opinion about why people should have computers.",3,4,0
1532,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In many ways computers have been very useful to the human rare. They can been used to look up information, talk to family and friends music etc. Don't you think people are wasting more time on the computer instead of getting exercise. It's clear that computers can do just about anything want than to do. But why spend your time on the computer when you can spend time with your family. Playing sports, or getting some fresh air. I think computers have a positive effect on people and negative effect one of the positive effects is being able to talk to your friends. i know sometimes we are not able to see them as much in school. In my opinion I think it is a great way so you can catch up on funny times that you can and friends shared. Now here comes the negative effect. Mang kids get bulled and picked by other kids over the internet. This can cause other kids to have a low self esteem, and cause dangerous events in the future. When it comes to computer they have saved many people life. Some of these ways are finding cures to harmful deases. Computers have information when serious weather storms are coming and prepare us for the weather. Wouldn't you agree that computers have played a huge role in our lifes. Sometimes we she take a break from them and enjoy nature. So have fun with technology and don't forget to stay active too.",3,3,0
1050,"Dear @PERSON2 ""@CAPS1, @CAPS1"" I'm sure you all have heard the sound of a mouse or people typing if you have walk into an office, our local library, a doctor's office, or even our districts schools. The reality is that computers and the world-wide-web is seem and used everywhere. Without a computer, how would @CAPS3 be able to access our emails, interact with family memmber across the ocean and finish that research paper out teacher has assigned us? In my opinion, computers hace a phenomenal affect on people and their lives. The computer helps develope hand-eye coordination, learn about specifil subjects and interact with people on the computer. Therefore, with such positive affects, @CAPS3 should keep using this wonderful technology and get our jobs done. Have you ever walked into your schools lab or walked into a office building and all you could hear was the clicking of mouses or the buttons being pressed down on the keyboard? Well, not only is a job being completed, but you are also exercising I remember last month when my class was assigned a five page essay. After the second page, my hands hurt very badly, @CAPS4, not only was i completing my essay, I was also exercising my hands. Not only does computers allow you to exercise, it also helps develops hand-eye coordination. Have you ever played a game where you had to cath fist, or playes a fast-pasle game of pinball? Well, those games require one key thing i hand-eye coordination. Computers are very helpful in todays world. The computer and the world-wide-web is useful in several other ways too. The internet also allows you to learn about certain subject or events you might not have a book for. My bestfriend, @PERSON1, called me one day from the train. On the phone, she was frantic because she was giving a speech and she did not know what the statistic was for type @CAPS5 diabetes. What do you do when you have no book for a specific subject? @PERSON3 went on her laptop and found all the information she she dit not know. this is just another way the quick acces to a computer benefits people. ""You've got mail"" I'm sure you have all heard this before. Besides communicating through letters or on the telephone, the internet has also given us more ways for fast communication. when you need to confirm a meeting place or ask your classmate what problems were assigned homework, what could be a fast mean of communication? Sending a instant message, or e-mail are two ways of course. Not only does computers allow you to communicate quickly but also privately. Both your e-mail account and you instant message account have passwords so that only you can access them. Every four out of five households have a computer avalable for completing assignments, checking, e-mails and learning about the, that happend in @LOCATION1 last week. The computer has put a positive affect on numerous people and their everyday need. In my opinion, the computer has been one of the best technologies in history. This amazing technology has helped students, teachers, doctors, police officers and even you bank aggents serve our community and make it a better one. Thank-you.",6,5,1

Some scientists suggest computers improve your hand-eye coordination, while others think it makes people smarter because they are seeing new things. You, @LOCATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 Newspaper staff, use a computer to type the news. You probally also use it for @CAPS3 of the things stated above.

994,"Dear local newspaper, Have you even been on a computer too long & haven't spent time excersising, or haven't spent any time with your family? Well, that's a big problem here in the @LOCATION1. In my opinion, to make this problem better, people should only be allowed on the computer for a certain amount @ORGANIZATION1 time & after they enjoy themselves with a nice workout, time outside & most importantly with their families. I think this will make the problem better, because you can enjoy yourself a little bit more rather than getting home from school & shooting right to wherever your computer is & being on it for the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the night. I also think this will help the problem because it will also allow you to get better grades. If your on computer all the time & don't have any time to excersise, go outside, and bond with your family then that most likely means you have no time to do homework. By not doing homework, your grades could go lower & you most likely won't understand what you are learning in that class. This one problem ran also affect you so many other ways. The problem with computers & why people, mostly kids are so attached with them is because @ORGANIZATION1 websites such as twitter, facebook, youtube, etc. & kids are @CAPS1 to them. This is part @ORGANIZATION1 the problem because kids can't get off @ORGANIZATION1 them, they like it so much. This problem leads to the main problem because if parents say ""Time to get off... go get some fresh air."" the kid always goes ""one minute"" & the parents let them get away with that, but then that ""one minute"" turns into an hour at most. This is bad because by the time the kid gets off the computer, its dark out and they can't go run around outside. I think this is important because think that facebook & twitter should be limited amount @ORGANIZATION1 time and should log you off after @NUM1 minutes. In conclusion, this problem is a national issue & in my opinion should be a new law, that kids have to play outside, and spend time with their families before going onto any computer. As you can see having all these great websites leads into a problem with kids. Thanks for your time on reading why I think computers are a big problem here in the @ORGANIZATION1.",4,5,0
288,"Dear newspaper, I think that using your computer too much is bad. Some people spend way too much time on the internet. Many people are too focused on the internet and they lack on their normal activities. Also, the computer is bad for people because they will be on the internet all night and get no sleep. This leaves them exausted for the day ahead. Alot of people spend too much time on the internet. Since they are always on the internet, they don't spend alot of time with their families. This causes the internet addicted person to lose relationships with their family and friends. Not exercizing is a result of this addiction also. For example, my stepbrother is always on the internet now. He doesn't talk to anyone because he is so preoccupied with his game. Another problem people encounter with the internet is being too focused. When you are too focused on the internet, you forget there is a whole world out there that needs your help, most people won't do their choires, or make a meal for their family. These people also have no time for their outdoor activities they used to enjoy. Internet addicts usually don't get any sleep. They have no time to study at night because they spend all their extra time on the internet. During the day, they will be very tired in school or work and the internet will be the one to blame. Last month my mom made a facebook. She is constantly on it. When she is on she ignores everything around her. My mom goes to school and she tells me how she never has time to study because she always on the internet. She also stopped reading the bible in her spare time to go on the internet. The internet is a bad thing to get hooked on. You lose relationships with your friends and family because you never get off the computer. People usually don't exercize or do thier chores. This is not a very good addiction to get into.",4,4,0

These is how ever a growing concern about whether it's beneficital or not? People become more lazier because of the many things you could do with it. I think that it benefits us all. We have learned many things from it. The computer shows what man kind is capable of doing. We can learn about many cultures with it. Students use it for studying and making projects look better. I asked @CAPS1 @PERSON3 of @ORGANIZATION1 about the concren. He says that is can expand our knowledge. There is concern about how much paper we lose every year. With computers it makes going green more possible. You can make powerpoints on the computers instead of using so much paper for long essay. We could do tests on computers. I think the future will be based everything on computers. You can email instead of using letters. For example my friend @PERSON2 said her school didn't use paper and uses computers. They saved money and paper because of powerpoints etc. I miss my family over at @LOCATION1. I want to see them. Not just by talking on the phone. I use the computer to talk to them basically have. I asked @NUM1 people if they perfer using computer to talk to there family or use a phone. @NUM2 out of @NUM1 said they perfer computer. I know I'm trying to they are great but they do have there down side. The games are horrible for the computer. People will just play and play all day long.

490,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know someone who lives faraway from you? Or have you ever used @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3? These are only a few of the techniches a computer has. Computers benefitted society greatly. It helps people @CAPS2 things such as allow people to talk to each other, goin skills from playing games, and it has images and it is easier. As I ,mentioned, computers allow us to communicate with other people. This way, we don't have to talk to people in person. it would get annoying if every time we wanted to talk to someone of three things would happen without computers. those would be either getting trouble at school, memorizing a phone number and the dialing it, or talking to than in person. Clearly, computers make it easier to talk to people. Next, computers allow us to talk to faraway friends or family. You could write an e-mail or talk to them in a chat. This helped me because I talk to one of my friends in @LOCATION1 and just recently sent an e-mail to my aunt. Without a doubt, computers make it easier for us to communicate with other people, no matter how far. Secondly, every computer that I have seen is able to play some sort of game, whether it be by a disk or on a website. These games can teach us many skills. The first skill we could learn is typing. just a few days ago, I was playing a game where you had @NUM1 seconds to type as many words as you can, as fast as you can. If you make a mistake one second decreases off of your time. It also gets harder as you go, getting from just three letter words to five letter words to even seven letter words and so on. Also, a class that at @CAPS4. information processing, is about computer. Once we were finished with our assignments, we could play type to learn @NUM2. That is also a typing game. As you can see, some games can teach us how to type. Another type of games where you need guide-thinking to be able to win. This teaches nto be ready for almost anything. Also, it teaches us to process what is around you and decide in a decision. In real-life situations you @MONTH1 only have a few seconds to react. Games such as these help in real-life situations. The last type of game is the tower defense. This shows us teenager to think like our lives depended on it. If we were to evr join the army and become some sort of captain, we would be able to organize our trops in the best mannor we could think of these tower defense games also teach us think and plan ahead. In these types of games, it costs money to bag upgrades buy @LOCATION1 towers. One decision is to either buy a weaker upgrade now or save for a stronger one in a little bit. Tower defense games make us make better decisions. Games @MONTH1 be fun, but they teach us skills too. Lastly, computer make things easier and have images on @ORGANIZATION2.

768,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I strongly sudjest that people should spend more time away from the computer. Instead they should be doing more exercise, doing more outdoor activity's, and most importantly spending more time with family and friend's. I think the best way to get everyone to agree with me is to write a passage to explain why I think that people should spend more time away from the computer. The most important reason why people should stop wasteing time on the computer is so that they could get more exercise. Getting more exercise could help you out in a big way because the less exercise you get means the less healthier you are. More exercise could also be helpful because you could have health preventing you from getting deabetes, and a lot of people get diabetes from body in shape. My last reason why I say that getting more exercise is good for you is because, if you get more exercise then you would not have to worry about all of the deseas and problem's when you are in your elder ages. Another way you could spend your time instead of staying on the computer is by doing outdor activity's. Outdoor activitys could be really good for you because if you are not used to going outside and playing a nice game of football with you friends than it would be very fun for you. I remember one time when I first started going outside I had so much fun. My last reason why I say that more people should spend time doing more outdoor activitys is because of nature. It would be really good for you to go on a walk in a nice @DATE1 day to feel the breeze and smell all the nice scents. My last reason why I say that you should spend more time off of the computer is so that you could spend more time with your family. Spending time with family is way more important then going on the computer with friends. I remember one time when my cousin and I were at his house and we really did not know each other but I got to spend more time with him and now we know a lot about each other. My last reason why I say that you should spend more time with your family is because you could learn a lot about you family. So now you know the three reason's why I say you could be doing more thing's instead of spending time on the computer which are exerciseing, doing outside activity's, and spending time with your family.",4,4,0

They help people to get familiar with looking at a screen and typing letters to form words. Computers are excellent for students that play the piano, like me. It helps you to be able to look at the music and have your fingers know where to play. The computers helps with the piano because they both involve you looking at a screen, or music. While your fingers know what to do. So I think computers helps children and teens to have better hand-eye cordination. Computers are also very helpful to everyone because it is great for researching facts, or even just looking for somewhere to go on vacation. Say you just got home from school, and your teacher had assigned you to write a two page paper on the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. You would not be able to do it by memory, you would need facts. So you should go to the library, but no one can take you. Well if you have a computer, it is a great way to research a topic for school.

Now I only see them about twice a year, it is so quiet without them, especially at my house. If I want to ever talk with my brother, it is great like he is in my home again.

Computers teach teens, and children excellent hand-eye cordination, and helps people like me to play the piano more smoothly and exact.

For instance if you're in a rush to type an amazing long essay you won't have the time to keep looking back at your paper, the keyboard and the screen. So you would need to know where these handy-dandy keys are. However, if would be a lot more trouble if you didn't have any knowledge about computers are where the helpful keys are. Secondly, people would be able to learn about faraway places. If somebody wanted to take a nice, relaxing vacation/honeymoon with their beautiful wife they would need to know the weather forecast so they would know what clothes to bring, and how much money they need to bring to visit all the luscious, freshest restaurants, hottest stores in this enormous populated city. Without a doubt, I would love to take a vacation, but if it's going to cost a fortune I might have to re-consider this amazing trip. Lastly, you can talk online with other people.

When your at a young age, anything can happen, while your on the computer, even worse things can happen. You could do bad things over the internet, won't exercise, or have time for your family. First of all, what I mean by bad things I mean, your child can go on bad websites, talk to strangers, or get harassed. When a child first gets, for example, a facebook account, most of the times the people who request them as a friend are unregistered child molesters and or sex offenders. They would probably act friendly to get the kid comfortable then they would end up kidnapping them. Also you could harass people or get harrassed yourself. And you can go on inapropriate websites. Secondly, you act enough generation child I go outside basically, it all kids. Lastly, your child won't have family time. Now with more technology coming out like cellphones, and laptops; kids would rather hang out with their friends and not with the families. I could understand the whole cellphone thing but you need to make more time for your family. The reason I think going on the computers all the times not good because you can do bad things by talking to strangers, harrassment, and you can go on inappropriate websites. you won't get enough exercise and you can suffer from diabetes, high and childhood obesity. Lastly, you won't have enough family times mainly because of all of the new technology that has come out such as cellphones and laptops.",4,5,0
714,"How much of your free time daily to you spend on the computer? It is proven that people too to fifteen years old spend an average of @NUM1 - @NUM2 hours of their free time on a computer. People age sixteen to forty-eight spend @NUM1 - @NUM4 hours of free time daily on their computer. Too much time on the computer can interfere with physical activities, social time, and health issues. Computers have some good advantages here and there but mostly result in a negative effect. In this post decade, the percentage of exercise was gone down and computer bills have gone up. Americans have now spent most of the time web surfing, playing online games, and interacting with online chat rooms. After school, kids go home and turn their computer on instead of going outside running and playing. More people across the country have gained weight due to unhealthy food and no physical exercise. Many local sports have lost teammates due to lack of desire for physical activities because of computers. Many people have stopped going out with friends and family due to going on the computer. The that runs through @CAPS1 minds these days is 'why go out to talk to my friends, when I can talk them online?' I think the opposite. Get out of the gloomy house and go out to see my friends. I don't even go online within every days. I check online for homework and in online shopping twenty minutes. Computers have a major effect on social lives like going out and being confident to meet new people. Lastly, health issues are raising rapidly! The reason we now have shows on @CAPS2 about people with weight and health problems can relate very much so back to the negative effect on people. Like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and the obese have shown how people gain weight. I think at least @PERCENT1 of these people spend to much time on the computer and not exercising. Eating @PERSON1's then goint home to play online games will definately increase health issues like weight, organs being unhealthy, muscles not functioning properly, and eye and brain damage from starring at a mouse and screen nonstop. People should stop spending so much time on the computer and get outside or get active because computer use does have a negative effect. It interferes with social time, health, and physical activities. Get up and prevent the negative effects of computers.",4,5,0
723,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would like to notify your business that computers benefit society. Computers allow people to talk to friends and family, they are important resources for many jobs as well as school work, and they allow people to learn and store information. Computers are one of the biggest advances we have in technology. First and foremost, computers allow people to talk to friends and family. I like to go on the computer, mostly because I'm able to speak with my friends. Computers are a good way to talk to friends that you @MONTH1 not see often or just to talk at the appropriate time. I have a facebook and I always talk to my friends about events happining in school or school work. For instance, last month I sprained my ankle and I stayed home from school for one day. So I went on facebook at around @TIME1, when everyone was home from school and my friend told me what was for homework that night. So, now because of our computers I could catch up on the work that I missed that day of school. Also, if you have family that lives far away or someone in college you can send them an email to keep in touch. My cousin is in college right now and I always talk to him on the computer to see how he is doing. For example, we always talk about sports we are involved with during that time of year. As you can see, computers are a great way to keep in touch with family and talk to friends. Secondly, computers are a big part of many peoples lives because many jobs involve computers; as well as school. Computers are a very useful piece of technology because people use computers for paying bills, jobs and more. For example, my dad tests computer programs as a job. The programs are constructed, then corrected and revised, then finally sent out all over the world. If people weren't allowed to use computers then many people would lose their jobs and many families would be in huge debt. Also, children do a lot of school work on the computer. For example, I take spanish and I earn culture points for my class by answering a question on the computer. Studies show that over @PERCENT1 of children use computers for some sort of school work. Computers are a big part of the working society today. Finally, computers allow people to learn about different places around the world. The computer holds a lot of valuble information. There is facts and fasinating pictures about different countries. It also shows people around the world the culture, style, language and many more facts about places around the world. For instance, my uncle was on the computer one day and he was looking at places in @LOCATION1 and after a long hard thinking process him and his family moved there and they still live there to this day. Computers inspire people to learn and see different places and @MONTH1 lead them to something important one day. In conclusion, I feel very strongly about how positive computers are to society today. I know that you will feel the same way because computers have so much to offer.",5,5,1
1081,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I think computers have bad effects on the people in this world. Yea they have their plus' and negatives hut computers are some what dangerous. Some people who use computers use them for the wrong reasons. Some people search porn sites, and hack into servers. I believe computers are supposed to be used for positive things not negative things. Another reason why I'm against computers is the people online are dangerous. A lot of people think they're talking to one person but it's really not that person. It could be anyone. Nowadays, people just give out information to random people. This is how kidnappings and murder happens in our world. @CAPS3-@CAPS2 is also a major problem with computers. (@CAPS3-@CAPS2) - means @CAPS2 someone over the computer. The effect of that is someone getting hurt on a crime not being solved. People also spend way too much time using computers. Instead of getting outside and enjoying nature, they waste time on computers. This is also the cause of a lot of obesity. People become obese due to not gettiing out and excercising. This world uses computers for the wrong reasons. This needs to change.",4,3,0
1476,"Dear Local Newspaper, I am awair that more people use computers everyday. I think that computers does have a positive effect on adults and their children. Computes help us by giving information about things in othe contries, states, and towns. It also can help children with school homework. Last thing is that it helps you communicate with friends and family members that live to far of a distance where you cant see them. Computers gives information about the latest and most recient things that happen in other towns contries, and states. If you needed to find out something that happened about @NUM1 years ago or more you wouldn'@CAPS1 see it on @CAPS1.V., you would be able to find it on the internet. Without the internet you wouldn'@CAPS1 find the things you was looking for. Another thing that computers is very useful for is helping kids with homework and school work. If your work is typed then your work is neater and more understandable. I can understand why some parents wouldnt want their kids on the computer doing homework. They might start doing something else or get answers for something they can do without the computer. But using the computer with homework and school work will make it where you can make sure your work is correct. Last, computers can help you correct with friends and family members. If you have friends and family that you want to reconnect with the computer can help you find information about where they are located. That @MONTH1 not be good for people who are trying to stalk or abuse someone. But in other cases like be unite with family can be very helpful. This can make families keep in touch and friend close. What are some of your feelings about computers. Some people @MONTH1 dislike them but they have good reasons why. More family time can be but I think you can make time for the computer and other things like family time and exercising. Well my time is up here. Hope you liked what I said here and you'll have a passion for computers.",5,4,1
1273,"Dear newspaper, @CAPS1 the fresh air that cools your skin and the wind blowing through your hair while you are running side by side next to your best friend. And you think about the millions of people who spend their time chating on the computer. You also wonder about the amount of exercise those people would have, and would they be able to interact with friends and family members. Just think about your current lifestyle is it occupied with computers or is it free and wild? When you think about chatting to people do you think communicating in person or communicating by aim? I have surveyed friends and resulted with five out of ten go home and chat to friends online. This upset me because this half mainly had kids that did not play sports but yet they were very talkative, so in aim a problem I still have yet to find out. I asked question like ""what do you do at home?"", ""are you a computer geek?"". (@CAPS2 questions were only used to support my survey) The next time you are asked to chat online please decline before you to become obsessed with the computer. The amount of exercise a person gets depends on who it is. There are some who live on their computers like the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 (a comcast commercial) and some who don't know what a computer is (not commenting). I am here to teach about the benifits of exercising and not the un natural ways of a computer. Did you know people can loose weight by exercising? If you just pick up that old curling weight one curl is ten times as better then a click of a computer mouse dont believe me try it. Interacting with people is a big part of our life its how we get , give orders and its a lot faster type of communication then sending a email. Without interacting with one another we can suffer from depression. Depression can make people sick for example, my father, when @CAPS5 was divorsed the depression effected his body and mind. At the age of @NUM1 @CAPS5 got a rip in his small intestine that grew infecte and could have ended his life. I believe this was from lacks of communication and this happens everyday to everyone just open your eyes and relise what a computer can do to a man or woman. (@CAPS5 was remaried to bonnie and now carrys a scars on his belly). This is a movement that should change the opinion of many, do people spend to much time on computers? Just get outside and talk to your neibor see what they think. I relly hope you consider my argument.",5,5,1
1430,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? In my opinion, I would say that computers have negative effects on us. This is because we would get less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends. If your on the computer most of the time at home, how would you get your exercise? You wouldnt because the whole time you would be stuck sitting down at the desktop. This is also a proble because this is how obeseity can occur from no exercies, and just sitting all day. Or people who have heart problems nad need exercise can worsen by being distracted by the computer. Being home on the computer does not let you enjoy nature. Instead of going outside in the warm wheather, having fun people are staying home. This is not good because they should be out having fun, not on the computer all day. Missing time with family and frinds is unexeptable when your on the computer. This is because yar supposed to keep your family and friends company and not daze off on what your doing on the computer. Also you miss family gatherings or leave yar friends lonley. Thats because yar to busy on the camourar nad not paying attention to anyone arand you. This is why I think computers have a negative effect on people. This is because of less exercise, less time to enjoy nature, and interacting with family and friends.",4,4,0
890,"I think that computers have positive effects on peole. People can find out important news online, and you can connect with people you don't see often. Also, you can order anything in the world online. These are three reasons why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Computers inform people about important news. If there is a blizzard people can find out ahead of time and stock up on food. If there is a burglar going around, people can find out, and lock all doors and windows. And by knowing all this information, it helps helps people plan events, like birthday parites. Finding out important news is very helpful, and conveniant. And @PERCENT1 of people, are less to inconveniances, if they know the news. Another way computers have a positive effect on people is by allowing them to connect with people they don't see often. This provides an easy way to share events tha have taken place, and just have some time to talk face to face. With video chat, you can show off new , or newborn baby. You can share you want with people you barely see. Experts say that freindships last longer if you talk to each ohter often. and with computers, this is possible. A third way computers help out is allowing you to order anything in the world online. If you need a japanese doing for someone in ohio, you can order it online. If you're are old, and can't go to the grocery store anymore, you can order then online. I have seen that people who can order everything online, don't have to do a lot of driving, and this saves time, money, and gas. This is also very convendent and is less stressful then waithing in lines to purchase on item. These are just three ways htat computers have had a positive effect on people. the are that you can find out important news, you connect with people you don't see ofte, and you can order anything in the world that's why I believe comptuers have a positive effect on people.",4,4,0
988,"Dear @CAPS1, I think computers aren't good for people because they could spend that time exercising, hanging out with friends and family and reading. The first reason I don't think computers are good for people is because they could spend that time exercising instead of @CAPS2'ing you could ride your bike or even walk the dog, exercising @MONTH1 be hard work but, it's better then staring at your computer screen. Just because you eat well dosen't mean your healthy. You need exercise to stay healthy too. So, run, ing, walk the dog, go to a gym instead of sitting at the computer. Another reason I think computers aren't good for you is because in the time your on the computer you could be hanging out with your friends and family. Lets say your family is going to the beach, you stay home to play games on facebook. Your family comes back talks about all the fun they had, even tho you weren't there. You could have been apart of those memories. Now time to compare with your friends. Its movie night, all your friends are going. But, you stay home to webcam with your aunt. You stayed home both times just to be on the computer. You missed out on a lot. My final reason I think computers are bad is because, instead of computer time it should be reading time. Looking at a computer screen and reading is a lot different then reading a book. Reading books increases your vocabulary, you learn about different types of litature. Over all reading books makes you smarter. When your reading online you just read what people say, basically rumors. READ! In conclusion I think people should spend more time exercising, hanging out with family and friends and reading instead of being on computers.",4,4,0
1163,"Dear Newspaper, I strongly believe that the effects on people caused by computers are positive. Computers can help you connect with far away friends or family members, find great naturistic parks, and help you find local @CAPS8 or exercise equipment. These three reasons will show you that computers are a very important asset to our society in the following passage. To start off, computers can help you connect with faraway friends or family members. According to a recent study, @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 citizens have talked with a friend or family member living across the country via the internet. Another survey done by The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine showed that the computer is the best way to stay connected with a loved one. @CAPS9 best friend @PERSON3 is @CAPS4, and all of his cousins live in @LOCATION4. @CAPS6 told me, ""@CAPS5 the computer was never invented, they would be like ghosts to me."" @CAPS6 relies on the computer to talk to his loved family. Clearly, the computer plays a huge role in reconnecting faraway friends and family members. @CAPS10 would you feel @CAPS5 you loved nature but could never find any amazing parks? @CAPS9 guess is terrible. Luckily, all you have to do is type in ""amazing nature parks"" in a search engine. In about two seconds you should have fantastic results. Many believe that the computer takes away time to enjoy nature, but I believe that @CAPS11 enhances @CAPS11. @CAPS9 sister loves nature, she loves taking pictures of beautiful scenery. However, she lost interest over time. She said, ""I got tired of taking pictures of the same local things everyday."" I typed in nature parks on a search engine, and @CAPS9 sister is back to traveling all over @LOCATION2. Lean @PERSON2, a nature expert says that @PERCENT2 of people who lose interest is because they don't know any new places to go. Also, nature in a @CAPS7 magazine concluded the best way to find nature, is the internet. As you can see, @CAPS5 @CAPS11 wasn't for the internet, barely any one would have the love and passion as most people do today for nature. Who needs excersize? Everyone. Currently, @LOCATION3 is extremely overweight. We need to enroll more @CAPS8 and create more exercise equipment, but @CAPS10 will people find out? Over the computer. According to @PERSON1, @PERCENT3 or @CAPS8 have a website which can be accessed over the computer. ""The best way to get members,"" @CAPS8 @NUM1 @LOCATION5 magazine stated,"" is to create a website online."" @CAPS9 friends dad recently just joined a brand new gym that opened up three days ago. ""@CAPS10 did you find out about @CAPS11?"" I asked. ""@CAPS11 was simple, I just searched local @CAPS8, and @CAPS11 came up!"" Experts say that the computer restricts time to workout, but in all, truth, the computer is the key to the gym. Connecting old friends and faraway family, finding great nature spots, and finding local @CAPS8 and excersize equipment are three very hard things to do. However, these are three things the computer does very well. @CAPS5 reconnecting with loved ones, loving nature, and exercising are bad effects on society, then what is good?",5,5,1
795,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I think computers have a great effect on people. Computers are useful for homework, it allows you to keep in touch with out of state family, you can also look up direction and information to a place. Computers are good for last minute situations. Computers are very useful for homework because when you type a report it looks more professial. While you type a report you can also research on your project at the same time. In some cases there are people who write very slappy to a paint where he or she cannot read his own writing nor can a teacher. A sloppy writer can use the computer to make his or her paper neat. If a child or parent cannot go to the library for some reason they can use their computer at home. If you are a parent at home busy with kids and need to do work; there's no need to go anywhere stay home and use your computer. If a child is absent from school you can go to the school's website and find out the homework. Do you have out of state family you wish to talk to? If so wouldn't you want to be a able to talk to them without a expensive phonebill? A majority of people would say yes. Using the computer to keep touch with family is not so expensive at all! Some examples are aim, emails, and other networks and they don't cast money at all its free. When there's a day you have nothing to do, don't you just want to go somewhere for fun? Don't you want to do something just to get out of the house? Well if there's a last minute decision or situation the computers there to help. Before you go somewhere and you want know a little more go on the computers. Not only will you get information on the place you can also get directions. Now you can go somewhere instead of staying home bored. In conclusion, computers do have a great effect on people. It can be useful to both adults and children. Teachers can calculate students averages easier and faster and children can do their homework efficiently. You can also keep in touch with friends. Overall computers are useful.",4,4,0
641,"My opinion is that people spend to much time on computers and donÂ’t concentrate on their family. Another reason is that people will not do school work if their to concentrated on the computer. My third reason is people wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. Those are my reasons now let me explain them. First, people will be concentrated on the computer and not their family. They will be focused on the computer way to much and not have fun with there family and friends. People ignore their parents when on computer. I know this because my sister goes on the computer and completely ignores my mom and dad when there talking to her. Please heed my advice or your kids will be ignoring you when you are talking to them. @PERCENT1 of children go on the computer and ignore everything. Now I can advance to the next reason. Second of all, peop concentrate to much on the computer that they dont do homework or any school work. If they dont do homework they could get bad grades on their report cards. If they get bad grades they could fail the marking period and stay back. Please listen or your child could stay back. Now for my third reason. Third, People wont enjoy hanging out with there friends. On the weekends you wouldn't want to be on the computer go out with your friends, enjoy yourself.",4,3,0

Your wasting your time on the computers! Thats what you hear your parents say all the time right. Well, kids dont really wastes their time if they are on the compter because they could be writing up a paper for a class. They might be playing on educational game on the computers. Even if they arent playing a game or writing up a paper. It is still making them learn some thing. Some people might say that computers are useless, but that is not true. When you are writing a paper for an @CAPS1 class. You would want a computer to help. It has a keyborad so it gose faster when you type. Instead of writing the word out. It also has a grammer check. That is to help you spell the words out correctly. This is why a computer is a useful thing to use. Computers dont make things go faster. But yet they do. They help you find information about many things on the internet. Also if you had to look up a person for a school project. I think you would find more things about that person that you would in books. It really close make things go faster. Computers do help you. There not a waste of time. They are useful to every one. They also help things go faster.",4,4,0
1497,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, Are you aware that more than @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 families have ownership to a computer? Maybe so, but, were you informed that at least half of that @PERCENT1 have family issues or such related The issue in bond is if computers have a possitive effect or negetive effect on mankind. In @CAPS4 opinion, I feel that this invention @MONTH1 be is taking a negetive toll on society. I say this because now-a-days there are inappropriate websites that children should veiw, and it takes away time with family. But mainly because of the recent @CAPS3 issue. Without a doubt, youngsters such as are expertly and a website, we'll just do as we were told and on maybe we could find one by an accident. Who knows? All I know is, there too many to count adult websites that children from the ages of @DATE1 log on to everyday. This is unacceptable on a person why we should be prohibited in computers. No responsible parent would be caught dead with a @NUM1 year old on an adult website and computers make it harder such parents to do so. With such experience computers take away time with and when I had @CAPS4 computer, @CAPS4 always now we never spent time with her.

But every we've been together much @CAPS4 now and I feel that computers have a negetive effect on society is because of the recent @CAPS3 I was called to the office one day to be informed that a crew on @CAPS3 com had befriended me and they were using boys and girls for drugs and prostitution. People take advantage of computers and end reading peoples infos. This could have been prevented but it wasnt. Now it's your chance, I hope you will feel the same way as me when it comes to the negetives and positives of computers.

1581,"Some experts are concerned that people are spending to much time on computers, and I believe that they are correct. Most kinds would perfer to be on the computer chatting with friends on line or spending hours on facebook but what is the point of this when there is a whole to explore, they don't enjoy natire like they should, and they spend less time with family and friends. If you are on the computer twenty four hours a day, seven days a week how are you supposed to get enough exersize? Well that's the problem you don't get any exersize. Some might disagree with me but the truth is, moving your hand over the mouse doesn't count! A recent survay has been conduched and @CAPS2 said that out of the @PERCENT1 of kids who own a computer @PERCENT2 are over-weight or indanger of being over-weight. @CAPS2 is sad to think that technology has taken over so much that @CAPS2 is ruining poeples lives. I go in the computer @CAPS1 too, but I am always sure to ride my bike after or go for a hike with my family @CAPS1 of the times I have softball practice so I'm not able to go on the computer anyway. Now what about the beautiful things in nature @CAPS1 of us are missing? The outdoors is one thing most of us take advantage on, some of us have @CAPS3 seen a day-lily are at night and new ones grow the very next day. This a facinating are might @CAPS3 see because they have a computer screen in front of their face. Kids really should learn to balance tecknology and the more important things in life like protecting nature and exercising. Yes, I know, that some will disagree by saying, ""but i am saying the rain forest, or the @LOCATION1, by being a member of this website."" @CAPS2's true you are helping but doing @CAPS2 yourself would feel a whole lot better. For example you could get a group and clean up the streets in your neighborhood or help plant trees in the park. The most important thing in life is family and friends, technology should @CAPS3 get in the way of that. If you loose everything what is the one thing your will always have? Loving family and friends of course! If family is so importand then why would kid want to be on the computer than at a family picnic? Is is because technology is taking over their life and clouding their vision of the more important things life has to offer. Don't you sometimes wish you were a little kid again running bare footed a field with your parents? That could be some what have if you got off the chair you have been sitting in for three hours straight and took a hike with your family. I might not be making much sense but being with family in person is better than instant messaging someone you just meet who lives half way across the world! I know that a ton of people are going to disagree with me when they read this but, I think technology is ruining some peoples lives. If you think about @CAPS2 a computer is like a @CAPS4-@CAPS5 @CAPS6 , @CAPS2 has a sugar sweet coating byt when you get the full force of @CAPS2, @CAPS2 traps you in and won't let go. A computer is ruining lives and experts have a right to be worried about people's health! All of us should get more exersize, spend more time in Nature, and be with family and friends more often than sitting on a chair glued to a computer screen.",5,6,1
1657,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 I believe it is true many people use computers and that many more will use them in the future. Computers are a standard of the buissnes world and are hevily depended on. People are even needing internet access on cellphones to stay up to date on stocks, shipments and important emails. Some computers are also just for at home use and are used to contact family members and find information that you @MONTH1 need instantly or wouldn't be able to find any were. Computers are still developing and are becoming faster and better day after day and most likely will never be put out of use but then does not mean they will permanently restrict you from othere activeties. It is true some people do spend to much time on computer but not everyone does, some people work from home computer and can not help being on it because it is their job. I implore you to consider the resonse computers are used so much and to understand that computers are used to help not hurt people. Computers are very helpfull in simplying things and are very useful for information. I stand strong with the use of computers and strongly disagree that they negatively affect hte way of human life. Computers do th things people would normaly not do for example someone would not go and look up every thing he or she needs to know in a look because there be only certain facts there looking for and it would also be easy to compare and contrast information on a computer rather than reading several diferent books. So if you truly think about it computers save us a tremendus amount of time with the things we do. Once again I say ""computers better owe life not hurt it.""",4,4,0
793,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a very positive effect on people. Now as technology keeps advancing there are many educational options online, you can now interact with people without physically being with them and you can play games that will enrich your lives. Firstly, I believe that computers offer a wide variety of educational options. On the internet alone you can view your school textbook. You can also have extra practice with the many resources that come with the online textbook. Without physically bringing your textbook home you can view the book online. There are tons of extra practice, and practice quizes in the online textbook that are perfect for studying. Also, when you see on the internet you can get real time updates of major events in the world. For example, the other day I logged onto the internet and saw an article about the earthquake in @LOCATION1. I saw nothing of this in the newspaper, but the internet was so up to date that you can stay informed about something that happened only a few minutes ago. But if you choose not to utilize the internet, there are many programs that are very helpful for learning. That are direclly cetered to developing your children's math and reading skills. These programs can give anyone a jumpstart in education. Another opportunity that could be helpful on a computer is the ability to interact with other people. Video chatting, @CAPS2, and using social @CAPS3 sites are very good ways to interact with people. When you video chat you can have a conversation with some on class on video! Even most they are not physically with you talk to. Instan messaging is a less direct, but still useful who talk to someone far away. You can share the news or just have a conversation with anyone you know. Lastly, social @CAPS3 sites such as facebook, and twitter are a valuable way to communicate with people. You can past messages, play games or simply talk to someone on these websites. They certainly take the best parts of online interaction and put them together. Finally, there are many online games that are very useful. If you ever wanted to go bowling but you never had the time you could play a game online. Or if you have ever wanted to drive a stock car you could play a game online. These online games are good ways to sire you the opportunity to do something you wont normally do. Also many games help sharpen your reflexes and your quick thinking skills. These could possibly cary over into the situations where you need good reflexes and quick thinking. Games could possibly be very useful when you need to prepare yourself something. Also online games are for and enjoying also. Overall I believe the computer is a valuable resource in advertion, interacting with other people and playing useful games. After all who could pass up the opportunity to better prepare yourself for life?",5,6,1
1643,"To the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, This day in age, computer technology rules the world. It's where we get our news, music, shopping and even enterteinment. Sounds great right? But there are some big downsides to this box of information. Such as, this gadget is taking over peoples lives and keeping them from excersizing. Now a days, people are even loosing human interaction from these marvelous toys. And finally, computers are very expensive electronics, they have much up keep which costs you money ultimately making you depressed. As you can see, although there are some great pros to computers, there are also pretty big downfalls that you havn't thought of yet. As I previously stated, computers are taking away from people excersicing. We're all becoming quite lazy. People rather stay at their computer screens playing grand theft auto or facebook stalking than going outside to play a game of soccer with your friends at the empty field down the street. @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 goes without physical domain for at least a @DATE1 and a half. @PERCENT2 of those people rather just tay at home on their computers. This is a disgrace! We cannot let this continue. We must change the way we live and get rid of this unhealthy appliance we call a computer. Of all my reason that computers are bed, this is by far the most disturbing. People are having less, and less human interactions as computers become more popular. Now you, can d everything from your computer. Soon people will be marrying them. Oh wait, that's already happened. Just yesterday, I read in the newest issue of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 that a man married a character in his computer game. There was a priest present and everything. They just recently got back from their honeymoon. This is sad! Look at what our world has become. People rather marry a computer character than actually communicate with real people. We must act quick, I don't know what will happen next. Finally, computer cost a lot of money. You pay @MONEY1 for the computer outright, but then you have all the up keep and there is lots of up keep. Computers are very troublesome. You just keep pouring money into it, which is just depressing. It will just break again soon or freeze and cause you to loose a report you've worked on all night. For example, @DATE1 my dad had to pay @MONEY2 in order to get my @DATE1 computer unbugged. He was so reluctant to even pay it and afterwards he was annoyed all week for even-paying it. It got even worse when it froze up a week later. He was freaking out. Thats all you get from computers, more and more frustration. I just don't think it's worth it.",6,5,1
312,"Dear, @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 I think the use of computers are good, here are some reasons why? My first reason is you can find stuff online. My second reason is you can have fun. My last reason is you can make @LOCATION1 friends. I will write @NUM1 paragrahs explaining my reasons. Going back to my introduction my first reason was you can find stuff online. If you can't find a job you can go online and find some. If you want to go to college but you have no time you can take classes online. Those are my details to support my reason. My second reason was the computers are so fun. To me they are fun because when you are bored you can play games. If you are not a game person you can play servays. Or you can find out facts. That how I can back up my second reason. My third reason was you can meet @LOCATION1 people. You can meet @LOCATION1 people be search them up if you are trying to find a old friend. Or there is social networking such as myspace, facebooks, twitter etc which you can meet @LOCATION1 people. Mostly everyone would like to meet @LOCATION1 people. To end this story my @NUM2 reason was yo can find stuff online, my second reason was you can have fun. My last reason was you can meet @LOCATION1 people.",3,4,0

The article stated ""more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society."" I think people should not use computers. Also technolgy needs to slow down, it's getting to advanced. My first reason why people need to stop spending time on computers is, you don't want to always say to your on your honeymoon ""we could to @LOCATION1 from our computer. And your life will go by fast and you want notice it, your all fat and old. Also @PERCENT1 of people who use computers are over weight because they don't exercis.

269,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, yes, I do believe that for too many people are 'addicted' to the computer, and spread more than enough time on the computer everyday! Not only teenagers but the children and youth have fall into trap of the computer. As I grew up in my younger years I hated the computer all I wanted to do was go outside and play. As I became older I used the computer way more often than I did before I now believe the computer takes time away from family time to get the sitting down to read a good book and hanging out with friends. Insteed of all those fun interacting activities people decide to go on facebook, myspace, twitter, youtube, addicting games, and whatever else they could find. I do not agree with that being sluck to the computer like is to chese. No! If there was our thing in the world that would keep parents and children together, it isn't the computer. Computers distracts kids and teenagers from doing other things in life, also it doesn't follow families to be a family. Before computers were made all people bad was their family. Coming home from school saying ""@CAPS3 dad, home from school. What t go play see catch""? Instead of that kids come home from school to see if @CAPS4 replied to your facebook message. Computers also cutt off interacting time that families always and to have. @DATE1 @TIME1 instead of talking to @CAPS5 myspace, why don't you grab and plays family board game! Or go out to on restaurant, talk about your next vacation and what you'd be interseted doing go to the same field have a game, or to your local base ball field and play kickball, instead of sitting there mesmerized by the computer screen! Okay, I @MONTH1 understand that some people just @MONTH1 not like to go out and play or engage in physical exercise and that is totally understandable that is still no excuse for sitting at the computer and a book. Reading is yet fun but it is also , with out being in school! As you read your brain to inner works, you or your so you can show off to you friends out family on words that you . It is shown that @PERCENT1 of strints who read . Not the @PERCENT2 who sit at the computer all day writing reply .",5,4,1
957,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I am deligted to write this letter to you. It has come to my attention that the people who support advances in tecnology believe that computers have a positive efffect on people. I agree with those people. I agree with them because one: you can communicate with your family and friends via email, via @CAPS2, via @CAPS3 ets. Number two: you can use a computer for research, and number three: it can tell you directions or give you info. on a resteraunt or place you want to go. I will now get into more detail on these three topics. You can communicate with your family or friends via computer. For example my friend amor, when we were best freinds and we were in third grade, he had to move to @LOCATION1. I cried the first day he moved. then the next week or so I got an email from him and so now we can keep in touch with each other. He comes & to @LOCATION2 every @DATE2 and we hangout with each other. Maybe one day, I will like to go visit him now In @LOCATION3 becasue he moved again, but I will have to do some research on @LOCATION3 first. With a computer you can research alot of things like this year our language @CAPS4 class read a book called ""my brother @CAPS5 is dead"" and it was a true story. Se we had to some research on the book and I found out that without computers how would I be able to research anything on the website it shared where everything , a description of the thing, and how to get there (diretions). Directions are very important. The show you how to get to a certain destination. You can get directions off a computer. I remember one year I had to go to my friends birthday party and we didn't know how to get there. So I went online on @DATE1 and we got the directions from there and we printed them out and we found the place in @NUM1 minutes. Without a computer we would have been able to find the house easily. You @MONTH1 disagree with me on this because a computer can have bad websites and can also became very addicting to some people, but I think I am right. Thank you for reading this letter, once again computers are good for the study!",4,5,0
48,"Have you ever had the time completely fly by while you're on the computer? You go on at @TIME1pm and all of a sudden it's seven at night. People should spend less time on the computer because they should be outside, it takes away time with your family, and there are other ways to look up information. You should be outside, enjoying the fresh air and playing sports, not stuck inside all day with your eyes glued to a screen. When you're on the computer all day, you're just sitting there. You're not moving around at all. Seventy-two percent of kids who spend all their time on the computer are over weight. Being on the computer on a beautiful is like blocking out the birds' songs on the first day of @DATE1. Nature is amazing, and you should be outside enjoying it, not cooped up in a stuffy room leaning over a man-made machine. People should spend a lot less time on their computer. When you're on the computer, time really flies by. You lose your whole day to it, and wouldn't you rather be doing something more fun? You can be alone on the computer in a dark room. You should be with your family and and friends. Computers are going to be around for a long time, and when they die down it will only be because something better came along. Your baby brother won't be a baby forever and your grandparents might not even be there tomorrow. Don't you want to spend as much time as you can with them? You're changing too, so you @MONTH1 be off to college or have to move far away for buissness. ""They grow up so fast. They're adults in a blink of an eye."" my grandma said to my mom. Almost @PERCENT1 of parents feel that same way. So, don't spend all your time alone with a machine, be with your loving family and chairish each moment. People should spend less time on the computer because there are other ways to look up information and learn about new places. There are so many books in the world, about any topic you can imagine. Using books to look up information is better than typing in the word into google because it's important to learn how to use an index and find the book on the shelf. A trip to the library @MONTH1 not be your cup of sunshine, so if you want to learn about a place, why don't you go to that place? If you're doing a report on @LOCATION2 for school it would be a lot of fun to go to @LOCATION2 for a few days to learn about it. And you can take pictures with your own camera, not just a picture you found online. It would be a really fun family trip. Even if you're doing your report on a place as boring as @LOCATION1, you could still probably have a lot of fun, hanging out with your family together. In conclusion, people should spend less time on the computer and more time being outside, with family, and at really fun places. Why would you want to stare at a screen all day when you could be having this much fun?",6,5,1

People will talk to eachother more, building more relationships and better conversational skills. Over @NUM3 of the sites used by teens are based on @CAPS8 networking. To be able to easily have a conversation with someone miles away is a sign of tremendous advancement. @ORGANIZATION1 is a multi-million dollar company. @PERSON1, a for @ORGANIZATION1, says that sites like @ORGANIZATION1 have skyrocketed in popularity over the @DATE1. More and more people are putting down their @PERSON2 dictionary to type the word into @LOCATION1, where it is accompanied by a pronunciation and found more easily. Students use computers for information on school reports in @CAPS7, @CAPS8 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, or @CAPS11. Information can be found in any subject. There was a survey taken to see which is used more often, books with a specific subject or computers for information or various subjects. Computers are used overwhelmingly more often. They're quicker than books and it's easier to search for a of resource an the @CAPS6. And say sight of particular interest or exceptionally usefull can be added to your favorites. Computers are more practical than books. Pictures of scientific laboratories where space shuttles are sent to the moon have @NUM4 main component computers. Adds from @ORGANIZATION3 show that they're computers are getting smaller and smaller. There's a laptop that will fit in an envelope and a handheld touch screen computer that can almost fit in your pocket. You can type papers and assignments so they're more ledgible. Computers can even score tests. Advancement is centered around computers. Before computers, so many things we do now would seem impossible. But computers open up a realm of possibilities. Typing is faster then hand-writing in some cases and papers can be saved electronically. If our country keeps advancing at the rate, than it is possible to have computers that do maindain chores such as taking out the trash or washing the dishes. There can be computers that talk bark to you like a real conversation. People can learn more and more information and personally advance in intelligence. I look at a computer and think of progress. There are points of computers that are not ideal, but overall, computers are benefitial to society. In a computer, you have access to friends old and new and information from millions of sources.

1774,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2 (our local newspaper), @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people have begun to use computers. This is a great advancement in our society! Computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. @ORGANIZATION1, computers are making a great impact! Firstly, computers have a positive impact on people because they teach hand-eye coordination. This is useful in daly life all the time! Statistics show that sports players who own computers are @PERCENT1 more talented at things requiring their hands (like baseball or basket ball) than those who do not own computers. Owning a computer improves the way you use your hands in other activities too. Something as simple as driving a car doing the dishes is made easier thanks to the improvement in hand-eye coordination computers bring. This is a fantastic effect that computers have on people. In addition to the hand-eye coordination computers teach, they also help you learn about faraway places and people. This splendid information is easier to aquire thanks to the technowlogy of computers.

Books take so long and I learned so much about my topic from my computer!"" @CAPS2 you are going on vacation, You can easily research your destination's location and culture with this advanced search engine. Why wouldn't you use a computer when you learn so much from them? Finally, computers have a positive effect on people because they help them communicate with each other. They have lots of ways to video chat, @CAPS6 message, and even speak aloud to the person you want to communicate with. ""I had to move away from my best friend last @DATE1,"" says @PERSON3, resident of @LOCATION1, ""With my computer we can still talk to each other and stay friends."" computers are definatly a great way to communicate with friends and family.

Computers make this a reality for us, but that isn't the only benefit they offer. Computers help society by providing us with search engines and educational resources allowing us to connect easily with friends and family, helping us communicate importances and plan things and a lot more. First, computers have become a vital part of education and research a like. Students at schools, elementary through college, are able to connect with much more information than without computers. You can even earn a college degree on the computer! That's right online universities are beginning to form. This is great for moms who want to get a degree but have to stay home with their children. Also, computer technology has been applied to research in science and hospitals. New discoveries have advanced with the help of computers that will actually help people's lives! Computers are used to search for a cure to cancer disasters such as earthquakes, and even help see a disease someone has before its symptoms even begin to occur! Computers have helped save lives and benefit lives in ways people never could have imagined sixty years ago. Secondly, computers allow people to connect and reconnect with other people around the @CAPS2. I recently got a facebook account, and within a few days I had found and to three friends of mine that had moved away a distant cousin who had moved to @LOCATION1 that i haven't seen since we was little and even my great grandmother! The possibilities are endless. Email has also been very beneficial to society as well, as @CAPS5 helps people communicate and plan events, which brings me to my next topic. Lastly, computers help the @CAPS2 communicate with one another. the internet is filled with websites made to benefit our @CAPS2, one being @ORGANIZATION2; @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4. If not for computers this program wouldn't have been as succesful and beneficial as @CAPS5 has become.

When i am bored i sometimes go on, and so for i have filled over thirty bowls of @ORGANIZATION1, while learning at the same time! To conlude, computers have proven to benefit the @CAPS2 and all in @CAPS5, not only people but the environment, too.

Mach people have more coordinion first, they get used to typeing then, they start typeins fast last when they type fast @CAPS1 give them more hand-eye coordinion.

1736,"@ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 you imagine the kids in schools that you yourself run not being able to research on computers? Would you be okay with kids not having the option @ORGANIZATION3 typing their homework? Do you think the adolescence @ORGANIZATION3 @LOCATION2 would want to waste paper because @ORGANIZATION3 their messy handwriting and mistakes? I would hate to live like that, and I hate to live like that, and I know my peers would agree. This is just one @ORGANIZATION3 many reasons why computers have a positive effect on people. Other reaasons include, citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world need an easier way to communicate with each other, and some people have to work at home. I know you as a @ORGANIZATION3 would not want to upset as many people as taking away computers would. First @ORGANIZATION3 all, think about the schools that the @ORGANIZATION1 runs. Now picture this; kids turning in eight page essays to their teachers, when typing it would have taken three. Imagine those kids the night before, scribbling words away with their cramped hands, typing to write as quickly as possible. These children have no computers, and therefore their teacher will have to take the time to try and comprehend the illegibal students' handwriting. I @CAPS1 almost see the kids screaming, their eyes darting around as they struggle to finish their high priority papers. If there were no computers, then this is what would happen to children. Also, students use computers for research; learning about different parts @ORGANIZATION3 the world. As a @ORGANIZATION1, I doubt you @CAPS1 say that research is a negative affect on school kids. I mean, unless you didn't want them to learn. Secondly, I want you to close your eyes. Think @ORGANIZATION3 yourself calling your best friend who lives in @LOCATION1. He does not pick up, so you walk to your clean, shiny black computer. You hear the clickety-clack @ORGANIZATION3 the keys as you write him a message, and the wooshing sound that your moniter maes when you press send. It is kind @ORGANIZATION3 amazing how advanced our technology is, how @CAPS1 you send a message from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 in a matter @ORGANIZATION3 seconds. You couldn't possibly say that all the hard work put in to makng computers did not have a positive effect, could you? I know that I talk to my friends in @LOCATION3 all the time, but not on the telephoone. You see, my family does not have long distance calling, so if I didn't have a computer, I would never be able to talk to her. I know a lot @ORGANIZATION3 my friends have the same issue, and if not then the time difference between locatiions makes it hard to call people. Have you ever had this problem? Would you want the effect to be that you couldn't talk to some @ORGANIZATION3 your friends anymore? Most importantly, I would like to tell you a story. When @CAPS2 five, my daddy used to tuck me into bed every night. It was my favorite part @ORGANIZATION3 everyday. But then, when I was six, my dad got a job that required him to work late every night. He stopped coming home and tucking me in, and I didn't understand why, being as young as I was. I cried every night for three weeks. After those three weeks, my dad's boss told him that he could work from home... if he had a computer. His work gave him a computer, and he was back to tucking me in every night, and he still does now. If that wasn't a possible effect, then I don't know what is. Many people are able to work from home with computers, which is just another reason why computers are helpful to all citizens @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I'm you, a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION3, needs a computer to work. Although I @CAPS1 see why some people @MONTH1 oppose to computer, I completely and utterly disagree. Computers help people with working, learning, and even communication! People @MONTH1 think computers @MONTH1 cost too much, but you @CAPS1 find them for they almost any price range. I do agree that citizens should not spend too much time on the computer, but it still has a totally positive effect on people @ORGANIZATION3 the world. I know that a @ORGANIZATION3 @ORGANIZATION3 the @ORGANIZATION1 should agree.",6,5,1

Thing about! Dont you think so? How would you feel if your teenager is always on the phone with friends! Do you ever time to chat with your friends or buisness partner about things. Well now - there's a new way to chat the computer, theirs plenty of sites on the internet to do so: @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, facebook, myspace ect. Just think now while your setting up meeting with your boss on the computer, your teenager is having fun on the phone not rushing to get off cause you want to use it. How did you learn about other countrys/states outside of yours? Well I have by computer/internet, it's a new way to learn about what going on in our time! You might think your child spends a lot of time on the computer, but ask them so question about the economy, sea floor spreading or even about the @DATE1's you'll be surprise at how much he/she knows. Believe it or not the computer is much interesting then in class all day reading out of books. If your child is home on your computer or at a local library, it's better than being out with friends being fresh, or being perpressured to doing something they know isnt right. You might not know where your child is, @CAPS2 forbidde in a hospital bed because of a drive-by. Rather than your child on the computer learning, chatting or just playing games, safe and sound in your home or community place.

My mom use to go on and on about how my dad spents to much time on @CAPS1, when he would only go one @NUM1 minutes a day to talk to family members.

He also mentioned to my sister how much exersize @CAPS2 was loosing all because @CAPS2 wanted to play online. In alot of ways, computers are pointless! Do you know how dangerous some websites can be? I once watched a television show at my aunts house, and an old creepy guy started a website were the teens had to video tape themselfs choking themselfs and who ever did it the longest won. About a hundred students died from playing the deadly game. There's also a website, ""blogtv.com."" were teens go online and go live on a webcam were anyone can watch them. I remember their was a week when my cousin, denise, and her best friend wanted to see who can get more veiwers. The two girls did unaproprient things on the webshows such as, flashing, dirty dancing, and showing body parts. The two girls were then banned from the website, but this was after people had screen shoted them and posted pictures of the girls. This should not be allowd for anyone to do, it's disterbing!

1745,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 years computers didn't exist, but now many people are having internet in their homes. But to some, the effect its giving on the people is negative. However, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people in many ways. Such as, the internet allows people to keep in touch, gives them technology skills to prepare them @CAPS1 more hi-tech jobs; and allows them to find and learn about new things. Dont you think computers help society? People live in all parts of the world, and those that are lucky get to meet a lot of people from different places in the country. But, you can't talk on the phone due to long-distance calls; so with a computer people don't have to lose touch! Its quite easy @CAPS1 people to talk with others from anywhere without having to actually see them. Computers are an easy way to stay in touch with family, too. Therefore, people can talk to their distant relatives from all over when you don't even have to go visit them. Having a computer helps people to keep distant friends and family close in touch. Lets face it, the world is relying more and more on technology and computers. But, if young people start using computers sooner then in life it will make it easier to get a better job. Lots of jobs ask @CAPS1 technological skills in order to be hired; so having a computer when younger automatically prepares young adults @CAPS1 life. Besides that, there is a computer injust about every work place that is up-to-date; restaurants, hotels, retail stores. and even in construction business. Nevertheless, computer skills aren't just a good skill to have; they are a necessary skill. Last, Computers are a faster and easier way to find new things and learn more about different topics. Instead of looking through various books and encyclopedias @CAPS1 researching, why not search the topic? Although, the computer and internet shouldn't completely replace books, it is a valuable researching tool. Someone that has never been to the pyramids could easily just research the pyramids and see amazing pictures, ancient history on them, and learn so much. Computers can help you learn so much about the world without having to leave your house. Now is the time to make your decision on whether or not you think computers are giving a positive effect on people. @CAPS1 the reasons of keeping intouch, giving",5,5,1
251,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 I have learned that some experts say that people spend too much time on computers when they could be excercising or with friends and family. I, on the other hand, think otherwise. Computers are a great way to learn and communicate with others, here's why: @CAPS3 of all, I would like to say how much computers help us in school. Most students use them every day. We can study for tests by looking for websites with lots of information and we can also research topics that we don't understand. For example, if you want to find out how planets form, you can just type it into a search engine and a list of websites will pop up. Another way we use computers in school is when we have to make projects. We can use different tools to set up a slide show while also looking up information on the internet. Lastly, the internet is also a way for teachers to communicate with their students. If the teacher sets up a blog, students can always see what the class is doing, what the homework is, and find cool links that will help them understand certain topics better. Another point I would like to mention is that the experts say that computers deprive us of time with family and friends when the truth is, its the opposite, computers actually take communication to a whole new level. For example, if you wanted to have a chat with an old friend, you could log right on to msn or aim and find out what's new in their lives. A second way to communicate with friend is by @ORGANIZATION1, a cheap and easy way to contact friends outside the country. Next, you could go a bit more old fashioned and just write an e-mail. It will take longer to get a reply but its still worth the wait in the end. Lastly for parents who kids live far away, video chat is also a good way to communicate because you will be able to see them and hear their voice as well. Lastly, I would like to tell you about just how much we can learn by using a computer. You could just go to a search engine and search any topic in the world and you're bound to finds hundreds of results. It doesn't matter what your interests are because you'll always find great information. The internet also allows you to catch up on recent news such as weather. Next, there are websites that allows you to ask questions and get answers just as fast. You might have to check your sources to make sure they're reliable, but I believe it's still worth it. Lastly, if you are getting ready to go on a trip, you can check flight information with the click of a button. Or maybe you need to find out what the weather will be like, there are many websites for that. There are also websites that can help you learn about the place you'll be staying at as well. Next time, think twice about what you hear about computers because they really aren't all that bad for you. Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better to go outside and play but computers do help you learn and communicate with others which are just as important.",5,4,1
914,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am against that computers benefit society in anyway. Yes computers are a great way to learn about things all over the world, but people have to worry about what is right in front of them. Being on the computer all the time gives less time of exercising, no sight of enjoying nature, and gives less time of interacting with family and friends. Computers don't benefit everyone because it gives less time of exercising. When people don't exercise because they are busy always doing something else less important, then you would always be tired. You won't want to do anything but just sit around & do nothing which calls for laziness you would go weak without exercise. You wouldnt have the strength to eat or lift anything which calls for your bone to go weak and you wouldn't get the calories & calcium & vitamins that your body needs to be strong. You would gain weight which calls for you being out of shape. Since your body has no exercise the weight & fat just stays. Being on the computer doesn't help you enjoy nature the way that you are supposed to. You will never see the world for what it is. You will always miss out on fun activities, then when people start talking about how much fun they had you're going to wish you were there. And you will always be stuck in the house which is going to get boring & there's nothing fun to do. If you're always on the computer cell the time you will never interact with family & friends. That is mostly & always more important than computers because they are always always going to be there for you. You will miss out on fun important occasions with your family because you're so addicted to the computer. And your friends will stop being with you because you're not hanging out with them. Computers really don't benefit everyday people because you miss out on the greater things of life. You will miss out on exercising, nature and especially family and friends. Then you are going to wish that you had spent time with them instead of the computer because you are going to see they had a great time & you would want a great time too!",5,4,1
1173,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are benefitual to society. This because computers do tasks such as helps research, communicating with others, and has fun games and websites. Computers are really great sources for whatever you trying to do. Honestly, a @CAPS2 without computers I wouldn't know what to do. Computers are like digital encyclopedias, which has just about all the information your looking for. Computers have databases or websites design to have with research just as the do. Say that you have a essay due tommorrow and you need quick and valid information you can simple go to @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which is a computer database. Your end up with saild facts to help with your final draft. So, you wouldn't have to go that far to research. Communicating is something else the computer helps with. For example email and @ORGANIZATION1 is a way to communicate. Email is where you can send a message and a wait a reply while on the other hand @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 is where you get @ORGANIZATION1 replys. The latest thing in the communicating @CAPS2 is video chating. This where the person your chatting with can hear and see exactly what your doing. This is useful for families who life a good distance from each other. Computers play many roles and being used for fun is one. the @CAPS5 has many fun gaming websites such as @CAPS6.com miniclips.com, and @LOCATION1. This websites help take your mind off a bad day. You can also buy computer games for your computer. A very popular game is The @CAPS7. This game is base around your charater and the life you chose for it to live this game can take you to mother place where all your stress just fade away. So, computers betters society in many different ways. A few include research, communication, and to have fun. The computer is a very enhanced tool to enrich ones life. Computers take on difficult tasks and usually succed. So, computers are truely one thing we need.",4,4,0
1172,"More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I feel that those people that think computers do not benefit society, are right. I feel this way because people need to start exercising it more, and interact with family and friends. Also, should enjoy life. Please read on to read in detail, as to why I feel this way. Firstly, those who are always on the computer need to exercise more, they need to exercise to stay healthy and strong. If they don't, they will most likely eat more and gain a lot of unwanted fat. Also, some of them don't even exercise at all. Secondly, they don't interact with their family and friends as much. Those people tend to probably argue with their family because they had to get off of computer. When you fight with people you want to gey away from it so you go back to the computer. It's not healthy to be on the computer for long periods at a time. Lastly, they should enjoy life. See the world through their own eyes. Party with friends and family. Go to college and do something with their lives. They need to enjoy things how they originally were without any computers, ipods, or even cellphones. In conclusion, the reasons I feel this why are because people need to exercise more, and interact with family and friends. Also, they need to enjoy life. I hope you understand as to why I feel this way.",3,4,0
1435,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A recent survey said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors think the advances we have made with technology and computers is helping us rather than hurting us. I agree that computers are having a positive impact on us. Advances in technology are helping us become more efficiant. Computers also give us the ability to research places and things we @MONTH1 never get the opportunity to see in person. We are also able to talk online with other people who we might have not met otherwise. The most important, though, is our advances in technology. Recently on the news I saw a segment of how at @ORGANIZATION2 they are using robots to make surgery more efficient. This also means that there are smaller incisions being made, so that means a faster recovery. Another part of society that has been advancing is crime solving. Before there were computers, there was no blood testing, no fingerprinting, and most likely no x-rays. Computers made these things much easier for people to accomplish. Computers are also useful for lending us the ability to research far away places or other topics that they @MONTH1 just have. Some people @MONTH1 never have the opportunity to go to places like @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION3, but with the computers it's almost like they have been there. Or maybe is in @CAPS1, but @CAPS1 isn't a very popular sport in @LOCATION2. And then they go on there computer and see that there is a ragby @LOCATION1. Then their problem is solved. When you go to a new country, you also get the opportunity to meet new people. But with computers and online sights like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or you can talk to virtually anyone in the world. I could be sitting in a chair at my home in @LOCATION2, and be having a conversation with someone across the country, or maybe even across the ocean! Or possibly you could be talking to some of your really close friends who live just across town. Either way, the computer is a convinient place to go and talk to someone. I believe that computers are doing us more good than their harm. Our advances in technology have helped us emensly with things like games and robotic surgery. They also give us the ability to search topics we want to know more about or a faraway place we've never been to. Finally, we are able to talk online with people that @MONTH1 just be across town or across the ocean. I hope that my reasoning helps you understand my point of view.",5,5,1

People need to relize computers are one of the greatest inventions we have in our time, but in my opinion people take that as an advantage and misuse them for purposes that they should not be used. Computers are not meant to be for playing games, or constently instent messaging. They are meant for learning purposes and for work or school. Why do people use computars for things that they dont need? People use computers for fun! They instant message, listen to music, go on @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or @CAPS3. People also use @CAPS4 and play games on unknown websites. Computers are not ment to be for that, they are for school and work. @ORGANIZATION2, word, @ORGANIZATION2, and powerpoint, if computers were used for those purposes people wouldnt be the way they are today. In the @LOCATION1 the computer is very popular people aboulutly love it! But these people are the people who are unfriendly, mean and sad. They also are incredibly out of shape. I know so many people who use computers instead of doing homework and getting fresh air. They are so independent they do when they go home from school is eat and play on the computer. I have a hard time understanding why they do that but I guess they feel they have nothing else better to do. I also know people who use the computer the right way and they are very happy people. They also have so much knowledge and there is never a dull conversationthem. Those people use the computer everyday but they use it correctly only for and they are just well are very smart and get good grades in school! Basically, what I am trying to say is that people who use the computer suceed in anything they do because they know how to use and understand the computer, but people who use it in the wrong ways will just be miserable because they dont know to much, they had average grades and they are unhealthey.",4,4,0

Millions of @CAPS2 spend countless hours with their eyes glued to '@ORGANIZATION2, @ORGANIZATION3 and @CAPS3 monitor screens. Spending that much time sitting in one space isn't healthy, not only do people not get enough exercise but they don't get the chance to apperiate the natural world around them that is ever changing. Teens and even small children get lost in cyberworld and don't use their after school time wisely to study or do homework. The internet is also a dangerous place and the growing computer use with maximize the problem. To begin, the obesity rate in @LOCATION1 is growing rapidly, a recent study done by the @LOCATION2. goverment shows that @NUM1 people are over weight and @NUM2 people are on the of obesity. We @CAPS4 could decrease the obesity rate and be healthier and happier by exersicing and getting out more. Spending all your time glued to a computer screen will only increase your chances of becoming over weight. Secondly, the more time you spend cooped up inside the less time you get to enjoy nature. The natural world is ever changing, and you will miss out on a lot of amazing opportunities if you hardly ever step foot outside your front door. Execive comouter use will wear them out quicker than normal, where does your old word out computer go when you get the @ORGANIZATION2? A landfill! The more your use your computer the faster you will trash it. If every @CAPS5 threwout one computer a year their would be over @NUM3 million discarded dells, gateways, macs, we would be living in trash. @CAPS1 exesive computer use ruins the environment, and hurts your health! What are you waiting for? Go run outside! Ride a bike! Give your computer a break.

Instead of using you could go to the park to play basketball or baseball. There are so many fun thing's you can do outside. You should go to your school and tryout for any sport that your good at. That way when you get bored there is always something to do, instead of being home all day. The last reason why I perfer nature over computers is learning on how to do something.

I believe that a computer can be used by finding things out from far distances, it can also give hand - eye coordination, I also believe that it is ok to use a computer if you are just using it for reasearch or other needed actions. When useing a computer it gives you the advantages of researching and studying far away places. This is good because some people have intrest in places around the world. Also, @CAPS2 need computers now adays, thier teachers give the write up typed assignments, or power point presentations. Also, parents you computers for work or maybe to get away from work to take a vacation they need took book it some how. Also, some say using a computer can give you Hand eye coordination. Well, it does in fact when you type. Some @MONTH1 not know this hut typing is a skill, some people type fast some type slow and some are average typers. Also, to teach little kids maybe even some adults, people have created a typing game on the computer it will teach kids how to type. Also, some people who type super fast go to get test to see how fast they type the test gives numbers like seventy words a minute. People naturally type about thirty words a minute. I believe that people should be able to go on computers for needed actions such as research. Many kids have learned about these other websites such as facebook, I tunes, youtube, and twitter. Some become addictted so they never got off. Also, being on all of these websites and more try to give you things. that my give you a virus. Viruses can come in many strengths some can crash your computer some just send boat loads of pop-ups to your monitor. I feel that it is ok to go on the computer to do research or bok vacations. If you are addicted to other websites stop because you will crash you computer with one click of your mouse. Over all I believe computers are a great source to get information off of but should not be addicted so called toy. Computer have a positive effect on people. Just dont be addicted and got outside... and have exercise with friends and family too.",4,4,0
439,"What I am going to tell you could change the way you think about computer in general. People might say that computers are great to be on its fast and you get what you need but I think computers are not good they become addicting and make your bills every high, computers can lead to your child sending less time with you and your family, also computers can be very danerous for teens and children of all ages. I say that computers are addicting this is a fact @PERCENT1 of students spend most of there time on the computer. Why are computers so addicting well they have instant message you can talk to people around the world. Now I know it might not sound bad but this can be bad for your pocket @PERSON1 who works with electrion bills says that because children spend more time on the computer the bills in house have grown up almost @PERCENT2 and the harder it is for people to pay there bills. Computers are what they say now a days are one of the main reason children spend less time with there family. This is true in most familys like mine because pof computers me and my sisters spend more time on then computer than with each other this can cause argueing and fughting between familys. Statics show that @NUM1 people would rather spend more time on the computer talking to people or listening to music than spend time with there own children or parents. Is this what you want for your you and your children to be separated by tecongly? Computers aren't always safe for teens and children of all ages. There are many reasons why computers can sometimes not be safe for your children or teens. I say this because sometimes we are worried about are kids safty and when your child is on the computer you have no idea who they are talking to or what they are talking about. Teens are most/likely going to met other people online and there are stalkers, posers, and other people out there that are pretending to be soomeone they are not and your child can be one of those peoples who fall for it and it can lead to meeting someone they might not know and they can be kiddnapped, rapped anyting can happen. Children can be always get hurt by verbal abuse they can be threatened by others and hurt and that can cause emotional damage so be careful and monitor your child. These are just very few things that can happen. These are my reason computers aren't the really benefiting are society.",5,5,1
543,"@CITY1 @CAPS1: I believe that computers (for now) are a good thing for our society. They allow you to see places. If you have a long distance relationship you can talk to them and they have many good excessories. What if you were looking for a new home? You could use google to search of selling homes in a certain location. Then finding some one to move your stuff for a fair price. Computers have many websites that you can go to when looking for that special place. The computer is also handy when you are going on vacation. You can look up the weather for that time. If you are going somewhere for, you can use the computer to find a plane. Computers are helpful when it comes to places! The excessories on the computer are endless. One big excessory that people like to do is games. Games are great to get your mind going. Practically all of the grades require hand-eye coordination. For example, @ORGANIZATION1. You need to remove all the tiles before the time runs out! If you are bored, games are very fun. I think that games are a great excessory. Some people have long distance relationships right? Well, if you have a computer you can have an online. This relieves many people when they know your not there. If you have an email, you can talk"" to your friends that you dont see at school. This gives you a chance to connect with them. Myspace and facebook are very similar. These are what you can use to talk to your friends at school. Computers are very useful. As you can see, I have stated many good reasons. Excessories, ""talking"" to people. Also, places. Many people use computers in their every day life. Computers are awsome!""",4,4,0
1636,"It has come to my attention that there is an argument about whetehe or not computers have a positive effect on people. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because with computers people can get needed information that could be used to help them, it lets poeple talk to friends and family around the world and also computers tecah people new things. Therefore, computers have a positive efefct on people. students whether it be at college oer elementary schoools almost always go to a computer when they have to fo projects for thier classe without computers students wouldn't be able to get the information that they need and could cayse them to get a bad grade on the project which could result in grades geting worse and worse. Adults use computers often for work and planning, so if there weren't any computers then it would mean thousands of people would lose their jobs and could forget sceduled plans that could be important and could result in causing families to lose money, not enough money to pay bills and could result in losing their homes causing them to live on the streets. Evry person has at least two or more friends or relatives that live in a different place in the wrold that is not easy to stay in contact with so it could result in having to use long distance calling which could waste alot of money. However, with computers people can talk to freinds and realtives from around the world without having to psend any extra money on phone calls to their friends and fmaily members from around the world. Also if something happens to a family member of somewhere around where a realtive lives we could use the internet to check in with them to see if everything is ok. Many parents are using computers to help teach their kids at a nearly age so they are ready for when they go to school for the first time. Also computers are used at schools mainly to teach the students about things that they need to know for the future, as a result computers become very usefull to people when they are trying to learn how to do something wheather its for school. college or a job computers are of tun used daily for important things that we need to learn for our lives in the future sow e won't need any extra help tyring to learn how to do something. Also we would be bale to help people when they neede help if we already knew what to do. As you cna see computers do have a positive effecton peopel because people can use computers to help them gain the information they need for school or work, it lets you check in with friends and family from aorund the world and finally computers help teach us very important life lessons. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people and it could save a person from losing things that are.important to themselves or others. ",5,5,1

Computer's today help us with everyday tools, such as cars, cellphones and your everday television! Computer's also make work easier, and you interact with people! I for one think computers benefit society today, and those people who think otherwise should look into it one move step. Cellphones, cars, telephones want! There all made by mankind, but with a bit of technology. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of cars have computers biult in em?

Oh i remember when my history teacher told me that it took @NUM1 hours to make a baseball bat by a human from scratch. Now it takes like @NUM2 minutes with the help of comuters. If this isn't enough to tell you that computers benefit us, then what will?! Experts say people who use computers a lot don't get outside often to interact with family, but that's false I say! Cellphones are a everyday tool, we use them to talk with each other of long distant calls pay? Well then chat online on your own personal labtop!

1302,"Dear Newspaper, I believe that computers have both possitive and @CAPS12 effects on people. However, I believe that there are more positive effects than @CAPS12. Some of these positive effects would be that they are essential for education, a very usful place to communicate, and they can be fun. My first reason for supporting computers would be that they are very eduactional. For example, you can research almost anything. If you are doing your homework and you forgot an answer. An other reason why @CAPS1 is educational is because you can type your paper on @CAPS1 so your teacher can actually read your handwriting. If @CAPS1 is messy. On the subject, you can work from home if you are sick or on vacation. But how do you get @CAPS1 to your boss? Email of course! wich brings me to my next subject; @CAPS2. Another resoursful thing about computers is @CAPS2. There are so many different ways to communicate; @CAPS1's unbeleivable. Take I @CAPS4 for an example. You can @CAPS5 to peoples cellphones. You can @CAPS5 to other people that are @CAPS7 or you can just @CAPS5 on some websites such as @CAPS9, @CAPS10, and tons more. You can also vidio chat with people on things like and @ORGANIZATION1. Those are just a few ways of communicating on the computer. Finally, I would like to tell you about the fun things you can do on computers. First, you can buy games from a store and download them onto your computer. Personally, The sim are my favorite. I understand that computer games can be a negitive thing because they are addictiing, but if you don't go on for hours and hours, then I don't see what the problem is. Also, they have educational games so learning can be both fun and educational. Another thing you could do is play free games or download the game from the internet do your computer so they are both fast and easy. To @CAPS11, Computers can be both @CAPS12 and positive but I chose to look at things through a positive eye and I think you should too. After all, computers can be educational, a social networks and fun. Son @CAPS13 my positive eye... You wont be sorry.",5,5,1

Sometimes when I'm doing homework I let the computer do it for me so it is eaiser for me to do and I look for website's on it they give you really good website's that is why mostly everyone use's the computer they mostly use the comptuer to look for job's, car's, or a house that is what they mainly use the computer for most people do not like useing the internet because they think it's cheating to use the computer.",3,3,0
1742,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern; I am writing this to let you know how I feel about the effects computers have on people. My opinion on this topic is; I think that both statements are true, yes they give people the ability to learn about faraway places & people & also allow people to talk on line with others. If we did not have computers I would not have finfished many of my school process and homeworks. But the experts who are spending too much time on thier computers & less time exercising enjoying nature & interacting with family and friends. I know this is true because I know some peopel who have gotten addicted to online video games & wouldn't leave the computer for hours & I know I myself have found new website & want to learn all about it so I'll be on the computer instead of exercising. But even with both statement being true; I do not think computers efefcet on people. Because without computers alot more students would be failing classes & getting zeros// @CAPS1's on projects; class asignments & homework. Becayse they dont have a quick way to look up all their information. Also most families or friends will lose contact because they lost a fun way to communicate. i think computers have a positive effect. Don't you?",3,3,0

People are spending way to much time on computers because there addicted to them, over weight, and not getting any exercise. I am telling you we need to address this matter. People have become addicted to computers. @PERSON1 says that in @DATE1 there were @NUM1 people useing computers, and it @DATE2 there are nearly @NUM2 million people using computers, thatÂ’s a big increase in the last copple of years.

With all these hours wasted in the virtual world, people are lacking in exercise, leading to many problems. They are also avoiding nature outside, and losing contact with family and friends. I think that computers are causing way too many problems and peerhaps, with some consideration @ORGANIZATION1 my evidence, you could come to think the same. Statistically, the @ORGANIZATION1 is the most overweight country. One @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons? Hours @ORGANIZATION1 sitting at the computer replaces healthy exercise @CAPS3 are all spending our lives on the computer, and sitting and clicking is not exercise. The great lack @ORGANIZATION1 exercise is causing health problems. Not exercising can lead to abesity, which damages joints terribly. Then, diabetes developes, taking away from the quality @ORGANIZATION1 your life. Finally, there is heart disease, a top killer in our country. All this from spending time on the computer? you @MONTH1 ask @CAPS4 the amount @ORGANIZATION1 time @CAPS3 spend on computers is much more damaging than this.

What happens when @CAPS3 are forced out into the real world and cant really do anything? Everyone loves having friends and family, so @CAPS2 doesn't make sense why @CAPS3 would rather email them with trivial things instead @ORGANIZATION1 talking. Instant messaging doesn't really bond people, as conversations are planned out you have time to think, so the person doesn't know what the real you would say.

1225,"Dear local Newspaper. I think we should keep improving technolgy on computers. Some people think that people spend too much time on the computer and not enough time outside. I personally think that the computer is important, if people don't use it none stop. There are many reasons wht the computer is inportant. First of all there are many places in the world that not everyone can go to. The internet is a good way to find out about a place. Also if you are going on vacation and you would like to know alittle about the vacation spot you can just look it up on the computer. Another reason is the computer can help you study a place too. Also if you are writing a research paper for school then you would probably want to find your information on the computer. If you are disagrreing with someone than you can find quick and easy information. All you do is look up something and you can find it. And you can learn new things that you have no clue about. Most of the time the internet is very helpful. One more reason is communication. On the computer there are many ways you can communicate with other people. If you have friends or family far away then you can keep in touch with them without leaving your house. Also if you are not sure about homework or something like that you can just ask a friend to find out. And you can send pictures or videos to people in order to keep in touch. Sometimes people use that feature for bad or inapropriate things. But you can do something about it so you don't get those bad things. The internet can help you alot in your every day life. You can learn about new places, you can do research, and you can communicate with friends or fumily. If we keep improving technology you will be able to do alot more than you can do now. The internet will be able to help you alot more in your every day life. Now you can see that the internet can help people and its not just keeping people inside that is why I think we should keep improving technology.",4,4,0

I left her a voicemail and called her house phone instead, the same thing bad happened. Luckily, I had my other friends numbers I could use. The next day, I asked her why she didn't pick her cell and house phone. She told me ""I'm sorry, I guess I was to busy on the computer e-mailing other people."" @CAPS1 I think of people being on the computer too much, I think they don't get enought exercise, don't enjoy nature, and spend less time with family and friends. First @CAPS1 people spend too much time on the computer, they spend less time excersising. About @PERCENT1 of people do this and it's not healthy. @CAPS2 people do this too often, then they will not get enough excercise and without excersise then they won't be healthy @CAPS1 they get older. @CAPS3 @PERSON1 said ""@CAPS2 adults spend too much time on the computer, maybe @NUM1 hours a day or more while eating junk food like chips and soda, they are not setting a good example for their kids. @CAPS2 adults get into this bad habit, so will their kids and it's to early for kids to be unhealthy."" I also agree with @CAPS3 @PERSON1, she is right about how people spend too much time on the computer. Second, @CAPS1 people are on their computer, its like their face is glued to the screen and they don't care about nature, @CAPS1 people do this, I can't stand it. Its like they don't care about anything else. What I don't get is why can't they go outside and do something for at least a half hour, then go back to the computer and waste their time then? Going outside and enjoying nature is peaceful on a nice sunny clay. You could have a picnic, take a hike, or even hang out with friends instead of playing on the computer. I understand @CAPS2 its a bad day like @CAPS2 its snowing or a thunderstorm and you can't do anything outside, then you go on the computer. I think that at least @PERCENT2 of people would try this. Third, @CAPS2 people are too busy on the computer then they won't be able to hung out with friends or family. @CAPS2 your friends want to hang out with you and they want to go to the mall. But you can't because your on the computer, she would be furious at you. You picked the computer over your friends to go to the mall. There's probably a @PERCENT1 chance she won't ever talk to ou again. and I don't blame her. People who spend to much time on the computer, would barely understand whats going on. @CAPS2 someone tells you something, it goes in one ear and out the other. @CAPS1 people do this, its really dissappointing because you dont hang out as much as with your friends and family. As you can see, people are spending too much time on the computer than excersing, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. @CAPS2 you ask me, I don't play on the computer as much which is a good thing.",5,6,1
1769,"Dear editor, I think people are using computers to much and are not benifiting as much as loosing from it people are getting less exercise, not seeing nature, and not spending no much quality time with their family and friends. Read on to find ou more. First of all, people are not getting enough exersize. Especialy children, They spend to much time on computers and are becomeing over weight. America is in a crisis with child obesety. So computer have chipped into that. Many adults are over weight because they sit at computers and work as play games all day. I reason that computers are more unhealthy for us. Secondly, people are not going on hikes or trips to see the beauties of nature. Earth has many things to offer, new things to explore and discover. People can be discovering many great wonders. Finding new species, is something you need to explore nature for: animals, fish, plants, there are many out there waiting to be discovered. Reason @NUM1 why computers are not benifiting us. Thirdly, family and friends are not spending as much quality time together as they should. Realitives you talk to over computers, why not talk to them in real life. friends chatting online on facebook, aim, things like that, why not talk to each other in person and have fun memories with each other? More kids are spending time on the computer than sitting down eating a family meal together and expreriensing what a family should talk about. Reason @NUM2 on why computers are not benifitting us.

678,"Dear local newspaper, I think people are spending to much time on the compture an these are my reasons, Less time exercising, an enjoying nature and interacting with friends an family. My reason is less time exercising people are to busy on the computer playing games an talking to other ones. Dont you think you should be outside doing some exercising like running around or playing sports instead of being in your house on the comptuer doing nothing. People should at lest get @NUM1 of exercising. You could be on the comptuer for a little while but not on it @NUM2. Take a break from the comptuer an go outside for a little bit injoy the weather an being outside. People just cant take @NUM1 away from there comptuer time I find that really hard to belive that people cant. Its like the comptuer took over there brains an all they want to do is be on it an never get off. My second reason is enjoying the nature go outside for a little bit an see whats going on there go take a walk outside in the woods an look for the animals or look for animal tracks. There are a lot of fun things you can do outside like climb a tree or going fruit picking. You dont have to be inside all day an stare at the computer playing games an talking to friends. You could be outside injoying the nice weather you are getting. Peopl need to learn that there is better things to do with there time. My third reason is that interacting with friends an family. It inportant you spend time with them an see how they been an what they been up to. But instead people are always to busy to talk to there family members becuse they are always on the comptuer doing stuff they dont need to being doing. There are a lot more inportant things in life an people need to understand that. Family is way more inportant then being on the computer but people these days they put family second because they never want to talk to them or see them because they are always so busy waisting there time on the comptuer. Like checking there email is fine but waisting your time on these chat things like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 its just a waist of your time people can hang out an do things they dont have to be on the computer asking there friends that they should just call them an ask. Dont get me wrong I have a @CAPS2 to an it takes away from your hanging with family an things but I make time for I can hang out with friends an family an enjoy the natuer an I do exercis. So I dont see why its so hard for people to do that. So in conclusion I think that people do waist there time on the comptuer to much like I said there are more inportants things in life an things you can be doing like exercising, Enjoying natuer an hanging with friends an family.

First of all computers can teach you all about the world without you having to go to a library appart for a book free sites like wikapedia provide fast knowledge and most anything, you can use @CAPS2 sites for essay, trip planning and just to satisfy your curiousity some people believe that computers @CAPS13 people from excersizing and enjoying nature however computers promote exercise and going out to look at nature computers provide quick and easy access to travel agencies, as well as information on popular tourist areas, in any reason, They also bring advertising sites for gyms and ideas on excersizing at home, Computers don't hinder workouts and nature walks, they make @CAPS6 easier to do them. But computers make other things easier as well, @CAPS3 can be much easier with the use of computers, @CAPS4 of dragging around heavy books, @CAPS5 can carry a small laptop; @CAPS5 also can @CAPS13 worrying about keeping track of papers. Everything can be saved to a laptop. Computers organized files so even a messy student can keep organized, another advantage is that anything typed on a computer is neat and easy to understand @CAPS9 some handwriting, @ORGANIZATION2 in @ORGANIZATION1 is an example of how schools can be simplified with laptops. Each @CAPS5 is given one to use @CAPS4 of books, ""@CAPS6 is so much easier"" said one student. @CAPS3 is very difficult for some kinds. Computers can make @CAPS6 simplier. My last argument is that people can talk to anyone using chat sites. if someone has a cousin distance country they can still keep in touch @CAPS6's the sam for a friends who moved. @CAPS10-mail is a lot faster than @CAPS7 @CAPS8 mail carriers taking a @CAPS10-mail from one person to another is almost instantanious @CAPS6 is also more private, @CAPS9 mail that is just sealed with give, @CAPS10-mails are pass word protected, there are also other sites that are for socializing, @CAPS11 messages also for People talk with one another, This can help people learn about culture in other cities, @CAPS12 and sometimes even Different countries, @CAPS2 sites can help close the gap between cultures, They can help get video racism they can help make the world more ideal. Computers make our comunity better, They let us learn about faraway places, make @CAPS6 easier to enjoy @CAPS3, and enable us to talk to other people from almost anywhere, so, @CAPS13 anything about, You'll realize computers @CAPS14 are benificial to our society.",5,5,1
1743,"Dear local newspaper, I beileve that using computers is a good idea and will help people. So many people all over the world have computers. Computers are good because they help kids learn, communicate with others, and help teach responsibility. Please just listen to what I have to say. First, I beileve that computers help kids learn. If you buy computer games like a cooking game you can learn how to cook. Even if you buy the @PERSON1 you are still learning by taking care of them. There are so many good websites that you can go on like @ORGANIZATION1. People learn through playing new things and why not play with your favorite characters. Also, you can go on google and type in anything you want and it will give you the answer. You use a keyboard for all this so you also learn how to type. If your teacher gives you a homework assingment why not type it so you learn that skill. This is why computers are good for hearg kids learn. Secondly, you can communicate with others from around the word or just your friends. There is a thing called @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION2. You use a webcam and talk to anyone you want. There are also websites you can go on too communicate with people from all around the world. It is pretty cool because you don't have to travel there to talk to them. All of this stuff teaches you how people are different and no one person is the same. Peoples language could be different or there personality. So many communicating things make computers even better. Lastly, using computers helps teach responsibility. Kids who use internet know that poeple need privacy and that comes with responsibility because you should know that. If someone dosen't want to be bothered then don't bother them that has to do with privacy. Also, you learn to be nice on computers. If you video chatted you should definitely know to be nice and not be rude. That is how you get kicked off of these things. Another thing is people learn to take care of things a computer is worth a lot of money. Not everyone has one so you should be thankful for what you have. Don't brag, but just know you are privleged for a computer. These things are the reasons computers are good. So if you ever consider getting a computer the answer is yes because computers help kids learn, you can communicate with others, and you learn responsibility. Now you know computers are really good for kids not that bad.",4,5,0
26,"Do you think that computers are useless? Or do you think they could be useful in many ways? I remember @CAPS4 my older sister had to do some research on @CAPS1, the computer gave her all of the information she needed. The issue to grapple with is, more and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly think that @CAPS2 does benifit society in many ways! Heres why, the computer allows you to get in touch with friends, research people, places or things, and relax and enjoy playing on a fun, entertaining website! My first reason is that @CAPS2 allows you to talk to family or friends so you all get back in touch if a friend of yours moved to a diffrent state, then you can easily get back in touch straight from the computer. ""@CAPS2's nice to send emails or pictures to friends, but if you do @CAPS2 from the computer then @CAPS2 gets done so much faster!"" @CAPS3 @PERSON1, one of my neighbors. My next reason is that you can research anything you want like people, places or things and all refferances will come up. @CAPS2 is good to research for any projects, or school assignments you @MONTH1 have. I remember @CAPS4 my brother was working on his project. Everything he had trouble with, he found directly on the computer! My final reason is that there are alot of fun and exciting websites that you can relax and play on! These websites can keep you busy, and you wont be bored while playing! ""@CAPS4 im bored I go on the computer and play games, that I find on @CAPS5.com,"" @CAPS3 my younger cousin, @PERSON2. Computers @MONTH1 make people become adicted to them. Yes but, you will be learning some interesting things on how the internet works. More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I strongly beleive that they do benefit society, heres why you can get in touch with people, you can research, and play fun games! @CAPS2's now or never to decide what you think! Call me and we will talk this through.",5,4,1
88,"Dear Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 no!' I forgot the deffinition to this homework problem and I donÂ’t have my notes. Now, in this situation a computer would be very helpful to just type in the word and get a whole bunch of results. This is why I believe having access to a computer at all times is very helpfull because you can find information that you've been needing. You can get in touch with a friend if you need to or just to talk to lostly if you are just sitting around and having nothing to do you can just go on the computer and discover things you @MONTH1 not have known. Having access to a computer is a real and very helpfull because if your just having a conversation with someone and you forget a name of an important fact you want to tell them, you can always just look it up. For me, a lot of the times I just need information about maybe a sports player of facts about a famous event. Since our technology is so up to date the computer is right there sitting with many of the helpfull facts we would like to know. Friends are a big part of my life and I love just to talk to them and see how they are doing. Again, our technology is so advanced now that there is a bunch of websites where we can talk and see how we are doing. A big reason why being able to talk to friends and family is helpful is for taking to people that are very far away and the ones you dont normally see. On a computer you can talk to people from not only all over the @CAPS2.S.A but even in other countrys! Finally, the times I find having a computer around me most helpfull is when I am just bored with nothing to do! I can just visit a whole bunch of educational websites on things I @MONTH1 have learned in school or wanted to learn. On the internet there are many things to keep you occupied like games or ou can even watch movies from your home onto the computer! If you have a computer around your house you should not be bored because there is many things you can be doing or even learning! Having a computer around your house is so helpfull, you can have fun but your even learning how to be good with technology at the same time. Computers are the future and its a good one. So I suggest you pick one up and just have a blast, you wont be sorry.",4,5,0
825,"Dear local @CAPS1, I think that computers are good for people to have. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. My second reason is kid might have to look important things up. My third reason is kids might have e-mails. My first reason is kids might have to write an eassy for school. Teachers mostly perfor to have the kids typ their eassys. When kids write eassy's they have to get information on what they are looking. My seocnd reason is kids might have to look important things on. They @MONTH1 have to fill out an alpaction out online when kids get older they want to look up schools they @MONTH1 want to go to. Kids in high school look up collages to get into when they are in like @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade. My third reason is kids migth have e-mails.

959,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the affects of computers is that while there are good benefits that come out or them, I believe more strongly that negative issues and situation arise from computers and that they affect people with greater impact in a not so good way. @CAPS1 three main reason as to why I think there are more negative impacts than positive and constructive impacts from computers are @CAPS2-bullying is a very big issue. Also there are many 'scams' and 'cons' out there on the @CAPS9. Lastly there is a lot of mis-leading or wrong information online. Going back to @CAPS1 first reason, ""@CAPS2-bullying."" @CAPS2-bullying can be derined as rude or nasty teasing over the @CAPS9. On social networking websites such as @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and so on. '@CAPS2-bullying' can include teasing, hurtful comments horrible name-calling and fowl language. It is much more effective than regular bullying, such as ""Give me your lunch money"", because once you put words out on the @CAPS9, you can never take them back, no matter how hard you try. '@CAPS2-bullying' is the new generation of mean. Secondly, scamming and cons come out of the @CAPS9/computers. When purchasing items online, you never really know what your going to get. @CAPS1 father was scammed, or connect on the @CAPS9. He was looking on what seemed like a very official site to purchase a big boat. He drove all the way to @LOCATION1 to get it. He took it out on the water in @LOCATION2, at our @DATE1 home, and the engine and motor were broken. That is what can happen when buying something off of the @CAPS9. Lastly, mis-information can be another negative impact from computers. When researching a topic, you should stick to the library, it @MONTH1 sound old-fashioned and slow, but when you research on the @CAPS9, you need to remember anybody can put or post anything, even mis-leading or untrue statements and 'information' online. Researching topics is not the only way to get false information. People can pretend to be who they are not in real-life, which is why ananymous chat-rooms and instant messaging are dangerous and un-reliable. As a conclusion, the @CAPS9 basically has stronger negative impacts and consequences than positive ones. Because @CAPS2 bullying, scamming or conning and mis-information are all negative factors of the @CAPS9, and out-wiegh the positives.",5,4,1
1352,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 the years, the streets have become less crowded with people interacting exercising, and enjoying nature. Is this good or bad? Technology has advanced so far that it might be better to stay home and on the computer than taking a walk in the park. Computers do have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage exercise, advertisements that encourage travel and enjoying nature, and computers allow people to interact from anywhere in the world. Firstly, computers are full of great advertisements. Some advertisements talk about joining a gym and exercising. Studys show that <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of kids without computers do not get enough exercise, whereas only @PERCENT1 of kids with computers do not get enough exercise. These statistics show that computers are better for people's health than they are thought to be. Next, computers have even more advertisements that encourage people to travel around the world. By doing this, people's intellegence will increase because they will learn new facts about new places. Also, people will be happier because they enjoy travel. Lastly, people's jobs will benefit it they're business depends on the advertisements they post on the internet. Finally, the technology used in computers today allows people to talk to friends from nearly anywhere in the world on a computer. Social sites such as facebook alow people to see pictures from where their friends have traveled. Webcams allow people to talk face to face up close about the new gym they joined. <@PERCENT1@NUM2> of people say they have a better social life online then out in the open when their friends might not be there to talk. I conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people because they have advertisements that encourage people to exercise, encourage travel, and computers allow people to talk from anywhere in the world. Technology is there to make the world a happier , healthier, and more social place. That is why computers have a very positive effect on people around the world.",4,4,0
1022,"Dear Local Newspaper: Are computers possitively affecting society? As technology advances, humans are relying on them more and more; most people use them daily. I believe computers effect people possitively because they help write papers, are a social tool, and are a big help with research. After reading this letter there will be no doubt that computers have a possitive effect on people in society. My first reason why computers have a possitive effect on people is they help with writing papers. Whether it is writing a resume, a science report, or a spreadsheet, none of these are ever seen nowadays done by hand. Everyone expects to see the flawlessly inked letters on the printer paper in whatever piece of writing it is. This helps the people writing the paper because writing takes many drafts to get the piece perfect; it is a pain to write each draft by hand. In additio, it is easier to read someone's writing @CAPS1 its typed, especially @CAPS1 the writer has hand writing. However, computers help in more than just writing papers. My second reason why computers passitively effect people is by being a social tool. Many websites online these days have social networks such as youtube, facebook, twitter, and myspace. In the listed websites above and many others as well, people can meet other people through other friends and games. The nice thing about meeting them online is that you don't have to plan a time to meet the person, @CAPS1 you are both online you guys can begin chatting. The chatting also helps @CAPS1 people have long-distance relationships, whether friends, mates, or family. Online chatting help people stay in-touch with someone they might not see everyday. That is a big help with everyone's social life, keeping then us ""the "" @CAPS2, online sites like eharmony or match.com take people with little time to worry about love and match them with their perfect mate. This also helps people who are shy get married and start a family. This helps people live happier lives, another possitive effect. Finally, computers possitively effect people by making research much easier. My dad always says ""You kids got it easy. @CAPS1 I was growing up, we'd to go to the library and spend hours researching before we could write our papers."" @CAPS3, its simple. Using the internet and a search engine, all you have to do is type a topic and you can get all the latest articles in just seconds. Libraries might not have the most recent books, or someone might've checked out your topic's book. Then what can you do? The internet is also an extremely useful help @CAPS1 the research topic is very specific, if its a certain becteria or species that a book @MONTH1 only briefly mention. The internet has a much broader range of articles, so it is much easier to find information for any topic. With research, taking less time to understand, people can spend more time enjoying the day, like playing outside, than in the library stressing because they cannot find a book on their topic. This is a strong reason why computers should not be seen as a negative effect on society. To conclude, computers have a possitive effect on society, because they help write papers, they are a social tool, and are a big help with research. Where would we be if we had to handwrite everything? Think about how many fewer friends or maybe even relationships we would have without social websites. What about how hours of research are @CAPS3 two clicks away? Computers have changed our lives for the better, and we should appreciate all the do for us.",6,5,1
1282,"Dear newspaper editor, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 have and use computers everyday. Computers are killing us as a nation. We need to put a stop to this abuse of computers. Millions of parents and kids spend at least @NUM1 minutes a day on the computer. They are either working or playing. There are many @CAPS2 games and other types of games out on the internet. Kids use these as entertainment. But having an @NUM2 year old child playing a game with guns is certainly unnacceptable. Kids often get so caught up in playing these addictive games that they don't even think of playing sports or going outside. Therefore, the child loses much needed exercise and fresh air. This can lead to obesity or other weight issues. @PERCENT2 of @CAPS1 are already obese, so why keep these horrid games out there? The last thing @LOCATION1 needs is more kids becoming fat!! There are two ways to use a computer for good and for bad ways to use them for good can be for planning a vacation, or working at a job, or even to look at a child's grades online. But many kids and parents don't use computers for these reasons. Kids have been caught looking at porn, buying illegal drugs, hacking into systems and other criminal type things. The computer is a way to do things that you shouldn't, while keeping your identity hidden. For example, whever I sign-up for a website subscription so I can play a game, it asks me for personal information. It askes for my name, my address, my phone number and other things. So what my mother has taught me to do is to use false info. So a computer hacker or a fraud site can't steal my personal info. And who are we to know that people don't do this with illegal programs? Computers are dangerous to @LOCATION1's well-being. On top of obesity, there have been reported cases of a child or parent having a seizure, having the picture of a game implanted in their eyes because they don't take their eyes of the game. There has even been a case of where a chid went mad and killed his/her parents in rage. Computers turn kids and parents into wild beasts. Parents commonly try to get their children to stop playing certain games. In some cases, the parent destroys an account on a website or takes a computer away for a certain ammount of time. These actions from parents have caused kids to go mentally insane! Cases have been reported of smashing computers, doing bad in school, killing parents as I said earlier and in some cases suicide. So in conclusion, computers are a source of health issues, action issues and mental issues. If we want @LOCATION1 to be restored to the @LOCATION1 we all love, then we the people, must put a stop to this computer addiction!",5,5,1
426,"Dear, @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2 has come to my concern that many people are debating on whether computers benefit our society or not. Some people think computers are the lives of many people, but I have to disagree with those who say that. I think that computers benefits our society in there ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. One way that computers help us is that they bring people together by using the internet. Many families do not live close to other relatives, making hard to see them. But with the internet, people can use social networking sites such as facebook or myspace to keep in touch with one another. Distant relatives can talk and share picture with one another to keep in touch. Also, the internet can help bring couple together and potentially lead to marriages. How @MONTH1 times have you seen those @CAPS3 harmony commercial that claim to have brought two singles together to make a happy couple? Another way that computers help today's society is that they offer many places to conduct research on a certain topic. There are so many search engines on the internet that lead you to numerous websites to help you find out what you need to know. Also, researching a topic on the computer is so much easier compared to going to the library and reading books. When using books, to research a topic, you need to find the right book, read the whole thing or at least most of @CAPS2, and find what you're looking for. But with the internet, you just type in what you're looking for, click, and go. Lastly, computers let you shop online and lead to a better shopping experience. By shopping online, you skip the long lines at retail stores which means less time walking to get your product. For example, many people rush to stores early in the @TIME1 for huge sales on ""@CAPS4 @DATE1."" A person could be left waiting in line for hours to get a product. Why wait outside for so long when you could just buy the product in the comfort of your own home and get the product delivered right to your house? Also, many websites offer special deals for shopping online so you can even money. In conclusion, I think that computers benefit our society in three ways, they bring people together, they offer many websites to research a topic, and they let people shop at home. A world without computers would be so much different than the world we live in today.",5,4,1
1708,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, Computers: well computers are a big thing now a days, you can look up information, learn new things, and it, keep you busy. It brings a whole package.

Looking up info, learn now it's entertainment, are some or laptop they bring",4,3,0
128,"@ORGANIZATION1, In my opinion computers can be entertaining and educational, but should not replace everyday living. Therefore I think that computers harm people and effect them in ways they do not realize. Three reasons that support my decision are the difference between reality and fantacy, family and friends, and your health. Many children and young adults are vulnerable to the assumtion that everything you see on the computer is true. Well, as some find out it is everything but that. The addictive games and electronic features lead you to believe that the people or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you see are real life situations and activities. Computers are showing kids the wrong mind frame they need to be in. It affects school work and how they behave. They need to be in the right state of mind and get back to reality. Your family and friends have always been there for you. By your side even through your worst. Unfourtunetly, this addiction to the computer has brought you farther away from them. They are not happy with the way you treat them. They want a change so you can enjoy life again. Interact with a human being, not some graphic designed computer picture. That's all it is anyway, and that picture isn't going to be there for you. Your family and friends last longer than that. Your body is special and your health is important. A computer @MONTH1 suggest exercise but you are not going to really do it. You know that and the people who make computer sites know that. Your going to stay there and burn your eyes out from looking at a screen all day. It is not healthy for you or anyone else. Moving you fingers and pushing buttons is not exercise. Your already sitting anyway, so you are not doing anything helpful to yourself. You need to go outside and breathe in air and be in nature. Run around or play a bill game, but not on the computer. In conclusion, you can see how a computer can effect a person. Not only do they mistake fantacy and reality as the same thing, but you lose interaction with your friends and loved ones. Your health is also at risk when you spend hours staring and not moving anything but maybe two fingers. Please consider the risks and believe the facts because honestly, we are losing the chance to live and enjoy the world.",5,4,1
739,"Dear @CAPS1, I'm writing to you today about computers I believe that computers can teach you things such as, hand-eye coordination and how that, can open job doors for you. Also you can socialize as well as study with this device. My first reason being socialization. i think that this is a good way to socialize due to the many options. one example would be facebook. This is a social website that is used to connect or reconnect with friends. in a recent poll @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers had made them more social. Lastly, computers are a good way to socialize because of the range it can travel. You can talk to people without the long distance fees of . This can range from the @CAPS2.S to hungary in seconds. My second reason would be that computers are useful in studies. I would say this because even though books are good they use hard to find. With the computer you can access multiple sites. This being you can from wikipedia all the way to the infamous google in just . Another reason I believe computers are good for studies in that you have endless. you will get a the . The lost . My third and final reason is computer give you exceptional hand-eye coordination can because I know accountant. i asked him, ""@CAPS3 did you take that accounting job?"", and he answered, ""They only took me because I have good hand-eye coordination."" @CAPS4 thats one job exemple, another would be real state. Due to computers multiple options you can look up because in the your client. With good hand-eye, however, you can be more efficiecnt with your work. This could help you lead competition, thus, making you more money. This then ends my essay. Stating with socialization, skipping down to studies and ending right on jobs and and bye's front steps. These are only @NUM3 of the many bountiful things that a computer can do. @CAPS1 I hope you read this with my regards.",5,4,1
1329,"Dear local newspaper, I believe computers doesn't benefit society. I feel this way being that lack of email skills, no exercising, and its addicting. Read on for further explaing. Firstly, spending hours and hars on the computer gives you no social skills what on ever. You could think before you reply and most people online talk or write way differently there then in person. People could act like someone else. Online you could erase what you wrote but in person you can't. Thats way you simply can't gain social skills sending all this time talking online. Next, you get no exercises. On a nice beautiful @DATE1 you'll be inside on the computer when you could be getting exercise. Being on line sitting down doing nothing just talking makes you lazy. When you're older you'll have to be writing. You can't just good all these long house on the computer. Furthermore, you should have your time for on the computer and exercising. Finally, its addicting some people could good hours and hours on the computer looking up all these videos. Seven out of ten teenagers rather be inside in the computer talking to people rather then meeting new people elsewhere. I think parents should restrict their children's time to be on computers. All this time with this fun could be spent doing studying or something to help you out in the future. In conclusion, i believe computers doesn't benefit society. I feel this way being lack of social skills, no exercise, and addicting. I think some people shold limit their time another computer and expand their time doing something important.",4,3,0

But people abuse it like ther @CAPS2 games and their dont even go outside they don't talk to there friends or even see ther friends its mostly not haven a life. And people dont feel like going to school because their over and there tired and ther just want to use the computer all day with not stopping. And so i think that people are just to addicted to compulers they dont use it for the fright reasons. Had then people get sick they could get hoadaks or they feel like puking. And they dont get to see that of things like go to the @CAPS1, @CAPS2 football, soccer, @CAPS3, valleyball or even take there own dog for a walk at the @CAPS1. @CAPS4 of people buy computers for games and @CAPS4 or muture people buy computer for there work and find were places are so the computer helps @CAPS4 but it addicted @CAPS4 of people.

25,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 off, I beileve that computers are very helpfull to many people by looking up information, or talking to friends. Although many kids should be spending their time outside, the computer is a well-occupied environment that helps kids learn and interact with others. I believe kids should have the right to stay on the computer as long as they desire. Although, they should always make time go outside, hang out with friends, ect. The computer @MONTH1 be fun but its always important to get outside and enjoy nature. Another reason why students should not spend all their time on the computer is because of their health.

Although, I believe children should have the right on the computer, it's always important to spend time outside enjoying nature.

The computer is a non-stop generation of intelligence based to help people learn, play and discover. Many people have dream to one day build a computer or make new programs. All students should have the right to spend time on the computer but also to save time to spend outside and with friends.

Other websites like this are @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 @PERCENT1 of people in @LOCATION1 have an account on one of these websites. One other way to speak to others, more for business reason, is @CAPS6. Multiple servers proud @CAPS6. such as @ORGANIZATION3, @ORGANIZATION2, or @CAPS8. ""@ORGANIZATION3 is my personal favorite' says @PERSON2 @CAPS9 of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS10 newspaper, ""@CAPS11 has helped me endlessly if need to contact someone on short notice."" That is one reason why I support the use of computers. Another reason I support the use of computers is because <@PERCENT1@NUM1> of all students rely on the @CAPS1 for research papers and other assignments. ""Even though I still use books,"" college student, @PERSON1 said.""The @CAPS1 is so much faster and the articles are more up to date. Search @CAPS13 are most popularly used, such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS14.com @NUM2, of all computer users with @CAPS1 access have @ORGANIZATION1 at some paint. Another handy program provided by all computer companies is @CAPS15 @CAPS16. This program is used from everything to research papers to. This program also has a spell check, a punctuation check, and a check for mistakes. The main reason I am writing this paper is because experts have been complain that people have been spending too much time on the computer and @CAPS11 has been distracting them from the important things in life. Such as friends, family, and nature. However, from the examples explained in this paper, I have shown that the @CAPS1 increases conversation and curiosity of how the world looks and operates. As for exersise, @CAPS11 is commonsense to spend as little as one hour working on personal fitness.",5,4,1

The computer can help you with all of this but is @CAPS1 bad for you too? In my opion kids and adults should use the computer. When people are on the computer they can learn about interesting far away lands. When your on the computer you can look up some of the natural disasters. For example people could google each quakes and learn all about the people that has lost their life's. The people that they will donate some money to the poor. Children living on their own. They can also learn about all the wonderful beautiful lands that are out their waiting to be explored. Everyone I know likes to the beutiful birds and animal. In their the world, They will be able to do this on computer. The might be so more this lands. Having a computer will also let you talk to people that are not easy to get. With having a computer people will be able to talk to their family that live in other states then them. I have a uncle that lives in @LOCATION1. I only get to see him because a lot of money to come. Somewhere on the computer, @CAPS1 is easy to just send him a message that say how I'm doing. With computer you will be able to talk to your friends cant talk on the phone. For example, what if your friend and did not. She can not talk phone because so what do you do you. This help you her. The last reason why we should have computer. If you let @MONTH1 periods of time then @CAPS1 will help you with hand eye coordination. This will help the kids that play baseball. They will know where the ball is at all times is they will most likely cauch the ball more often so playing a a little bit of video games is not bad for unless one. Using the computer is @CAPS1 good to do or not using the computer helps people be able to interact wild people that so easy to talk to. So @CAPS1 you are compleatly agenst using computer the get up and use @CAPS1 right now.",5,4,1
1748,"Dear local newspaper: I strongly feel that computer technology has a neagtive affect on the people of our society. People of our society are spending to much time on computers, and not enough time exersizing and interacting with family and friends. By starting now we can make a difference in the lives of thousands. First off I would like to say that it is imporitive that we exersize daily. If we don't fit exersizing into our day to day schedual, we are potentally putting our health on the line. Activities such as taking a dog for a walk, riding a bike, or taking a nice jog through the park are just a few ways to help your physical fitness. Also taking part in extracuricular activities can play a major part in exersize. This not only helps physically, but it helps mentally too. Finnally another method of exersizing is to play a part in your local community service projects. Exersizing every day is just one way to keep you active and off the computer. Lastly, interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. Playing games is one way that can help you stay connected with your family. This can bring you closer to the people you love, and help them get to know you a little better. Furthermore you can play with your friends, and in the process develops social skills. Who knows developing social skills could help you in the future. Plus, by interacting with family and friends you can learn to be relaxed and let your life take its natural source. This is another helpful technique that can improve the quality of your life and keep you from the temptation of being on the computer. In conclusion techniques like exersizing and interacting with family and friends can help you stay off the computer. By working together and trying these methods, the computer can be eliminated from our daily rutines.",4,5,0

Computers are our sourse @CAPS5 infromation, and time @CAPS5 liesure these days, but we are fogetting that there is a life away from them as well such as having family time, and taking walks in the beautiful, nature. To much use @ORGANIZATION2 a computer is leading to aweful health.

Computers are like mind, and body eaters the slowly take away from you and let you cry, and weap @CAPS5 the rest @ORGANIZATION2 your life, @CAPS2't you agree? Do you know the @ORGANIZATION2 says that the second biggest leading cause @ORGANIZATION2 obisity is computer? Yes that is true! I have experinced problem. While growing up. When I was @NUM1 I was adictied to the computer. Day and night my eyes were guled to the computer screen. I had nothing on my mind except @CAPS5 computer, my mom got mad at me and yelled at me to get away from it, but I didn't. Slowly, slowly I started to put on heavy, awful faton myself, and later I found out I was over weight @CAPS5 my age. To this day I have not lost the weight I put on from using the computer, and I am sure others are to. Obesity just doesn't happen from eating to much. It also happens from not doing any cardio activities, which the computer stps us from doing. So basically the computer is unhealth. As said by @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 people from the state @ORGANIZATION2 @LOCATION1. Time consuming computers, are taking away family time from many family these days. Do you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 families aren't getting to spend the time with each other as the wish, reason being computers? Kids are on the computer playing games, moms finding a resipe online to make @CAPS5 dinner, and dad is buying another stock online.

If anyone ever wants to see nature they should come to @LOCATION1, but the sad thing is that the people @ORGANIZATION2 @LOCATION1 aren't appriating nature themselves because they are do busy with things such as computers. I know one time we went to a comp out, and we were ready @CAPS5 nature and this boy brings his computer, and wouldn't you know it the whole got people forgot about nature and played with the boys computer. So many people missed out on the nature and the beautiful animals seen one the such as yellow @CAPS3 through that time was amazing and it is very unfortunet that many people missed out on that event. People these days are once again not apricating nature, which one day they will regret, because @ORGANIZATION2 the fact the one day you @MONTH1 not be around to enjoy this got given @CAPS2't let the computer tell you what to do lets be the boss and @CAPS5 ourself. It is now or never the decision is in your hand, make the right decision and say no to computers. Go out their enjoy nature, spend time with you family, and get healthy.

83,"Dear Newspaper Computers have been a great learning source and i think it's time we give them some cridit insted of worrying over them. I will be telling you about how I think computers are great. One reason they are vary helpful is that books dont always have all of the information. So if you need to know a fact or need more information for a project you can go on the computer and it's all right there and you will have known more facts then when you started. The second reason is that you can be almost anywhere and half acess to a computer and you might not have a phone but you can talk or send a message. Not everyone has a phone but computers are a secondary way to have a conversation with someone. Another reason, is its not always sunny outside and when it is a rainy day you have a fun way to play and learn without having to be outside. The computer dosnt replace the outdores or exercising it is just a passtime when you dont have the oppertunity to be outside. I hope you liked and understod my reasons and will take them in to concideration when going over the topic.",3,4,0
489,"Dear The @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 I can see both sides of your argument, on wether computers are important. However, computers have revelotivizied they way we live our lives. Just for a moment, think what would the world be like without computers. I feel the computers one or important aspect of our lives. Computers are espicially important to students and teachers. For instance if a student needed to do a report on @LOCATION1, he could look up facts and other things on @LOCATION1, then he could condence the facts into a paragraph on a word document, and if he had a question he could email his teachers. Finaly he, could print out the finished report. All that, without having to get up and bother his parrents to go to the bookstore and pay @NUM1 on a book that he will probably read one time. Also if he had a question there would be no comunication outside of school. Anothe example of students using computers is online textbooks, which spares them of logging heavy texbooks home. Because I know computers have helped me in school and more work much easier. Secondly, @PERCENT1 of busnesses say that they use computer daily, and some agree that without computer, their busnesses would fail. Computer make busnes much easier, espically with the busness monoging and file keeping programs that are oidible. On a computer, busnesses can store customer information, comppare income, and keep stock of inventary without having a cluttered pile or file cobinet. Computers can also saave buseness money because that con cut out jobs such as record keeper. Also busnesses con save time of having meeting via web cams instead of having people drive from state to state for one meeting then do it next monet and the month after; and they coud emall impertant things such as sales projections and other things as well. Computers are also important and helpful in the home. People can do grocery shopping from the home they can order pizza online and they can go shopping online. Also, people can pay their bills online which saves paper. Lets say this, a moter, has a child! who is sick and she wants to know the to heal him, what to feel him, and what medicine to give hime. She can look all this up on the computer and bookmail the websites for next time. Then her other child comes provide, and she wants to find a health snork. She can feed him which she ca do online. Next she ways to make chicken fried rice,out she wnet know how, she can look up the recipe online. Finaly after dinner she need to cleen a stain on the carpet but it wont come out so she buys a carpet cleener from the web. Computers have just moderthy mothers day so much easier. Without computers our lives would be much harder. If we didnt have computers if the person who a report on @LOCATION1 would have failed, the sick child would have not, the hungry child would have been fed unhealthy food, and @MONTH1 would fail. coputers are an important afect of our lives.",4,5,0
1191,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you think that children spend to much time on the computer. The issue that is going around is @CAPS2 computers have good effects on people or bad ones. I strongly believe that they have bad effects on people. I believe this because people spend more time on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. Another reason is that people argue it teaches hand eye coordination, well so does sports and just playing. My last reason is that people argue that it is some thing that helps you learn about people and far away places, but books @CAPS2 the same thing. I know alot of people feel that computer have good effects but the truth is they have bad ones. First, people spend more to on the computer than they @CAPS2 exerciseing. People rather stay inside and play games on the internet then go outside and play tag or any sport. On a talk it was said that, ""In @LOCATION1 people are alot over wieght"", and it was also said that the number of over wieght people in the world was the of @LOCATION2"". So I believe that people should get of the computer and exercise. Secondly, people think that it teaches hand eye coordination but so @CAPS2 sports. Instead of being on the computer learning hand eye. You could be out side learning hand eye coordination. Again instead of just sitting at the computer your outside running around haveing fun while you learn hand eye coordination. My last reason is, that people argue that people use it to learn about far away places and people, but they have books for that too. People rather look stuff up on the computer but as soon as they're finsh the start playing games or the computer. Also some of the information might not even be true. Because people hack sights all the time and change things but you can't hack a book. The only thing you can @CAPS2 to change it is to rip out pages and that only waste your money to a new book. So I believe that books are more reliable. Now is the time to make your disicion. @CAPS2 computers have good or bad effects. I believe that computers have bad effect on people. Other things could teach you remarkable hand eye coordination and other great sources to about other place then the computer. Most importantly people should spend more time exerciseing the they @CAPS2 on the computer. Now it time for you to go ahead and put this on the front page of your newspaper and let the whole world know. ",4,4,0

The computer is common life everybody needs it or uses it in some way of form. People need it because they look a news when they could not catch it on @CAPS1 so they go to the amazing technoliga. We have witch is the @CAPS2.C of laptops or phone with internet. This just is a natural thing in are lifestyle now the computer does not stop you from going outside and playing other things its you say no I love this tecnoligy do much that I want to stay on it. So does the computer mess up someones life in anyway or is it just you. The beautiful things a @CAPS2.C can do for you. A computer can do lots of things for you wont want to leave it and go do other things, like you have lots of home work and a project that you need I @CAPS4 for so you go do your work and you can also listen to music and type your project and doing things even though your not outside playing and being active doesn't mean that your not doing somethings better for your life like typing faster for a job when you get older and nowing how to use a @CAPS2.C good and not being out of touch with family there is cameal. @CAPS2.C's have been around for a long time and eversince this world has had them we have been smarter more talented in most ways and kids and adults are in touch with wats going around us and how the world is acting technology has helped many people when they needed something done in a rush or for mostly everything they have been around for things the @NUM1 year old people can still go. Research things that they have never known. And find out billions of aplications for it. Although most people stay on for long periods of time but they cant stay on all day without say hi to family and talking to them. So has been around for a long time and still is being used everyday and always will be.

1372,"Dear @CAPS1 Local newspaper, I heard that you were concerd about people and how they use the computer to much. I think that computers are a good thing to have because many people use computers for school, work ect. I think that computers are good use, many people use it for research and resources. It is easier to use them, when you are going on vaction because you can check out how much hotels are, where resteraunts are, and what interesting places are there, instead of calling/driving around. Computers are good for school because I think books are harder/longer to use than computers. Also for questions you can go to one of the websites an you ask the question and many other people might answer the question your looking for. There also useful for work most people use computers for work. They can put there taxes/documents on there computers. Computers can be used just for fun too. There are chat; facebook games. I think that computers are useful for many things, but I also think that some people spend too much time on them too. Computers are great, but you should also use other things too like maps, book, ect. Many can spend @NUM1 hours on the computer facebooking and gaming. I think that it's important for people to go outside and hang out with friends. Alot of people spend there time on the computer during @DATE1 because its cold and sometimes snowing. I don't think that they should spend there whole time on the computer though because you dont just want to depend on electrictronics everytime. I think that computers should be used not alot in the @DATE2 because I think hanging out with friends and family are important and also the weather nice. I think that computers can be very useful with directions, work, school work but you shouldn't spend alot of time on them. Electronics arent everything in life.

741,"Dear @CAPS1, Technology such as computer is proven to have a positive effect on people. Computers teach you hand eye coordination, they give you the ability to learn about far away places, and allow you to communicate with others online. Technology is continuing to grow, and it is becoming to impact our lives more and more each day. One way that computers benifit society is that they teach you hand-eye coordination. For example, as a person becomes firmiliar with their computer they are soon able to type on the keyboard with out even looking down to see what letter or number they are touching with their fingers. Although the person isn't developing hand-eye coordination @CAPS2 playing a sport such as baseball, they have still developed this coordination. Computers also benifit our society because they give others the ability to learn about far away places. Instead of walking or driving to the library to find a book about @LOCATION1; they can simply go online and type in @LOCATION1 under a search engine. Within seconds, thousands of sources appear right before your eyes, and you didnt even have to leave your chair! That is another reason why computers benifit our society. Lastly, computers and technology benifit our society becaus' they allow you to communicate with others, reconnect with old friend or family, or simply share the latest drama from your art class. I know when ever I'm at my computer my instant messanger is always open. It is something I utilize everyday in order to communicate with my friends and distant realitive. In conclusion, computers do benifit society, and they are proven to have a positive affect on people.

731,"Dear Readers, I believe that Computers do good in our country and have a positive affect too people. This is because it saves paper sending emails and you save money too, also you can learn new things about different countrys like @LOCATION1, and lastly you can iteract with people you know and talk to them and use technowlogy to your advantage. These are a few reasons why computers have positive affect on society and the wayore live. First off computers help save the environment and they do this by leting us not cut down trees and make paper out of them. Do you know how many trees are cut down a day around @NUM1 trees and they are all not imeditly taken to the mills to be turned into paper. But thet stopin piles at loging sites and are leftrotting there not be my put to good work or what they should be. I feel that trees have feelings like us but can't talk with out a mouth. So when you cut down a tree its like robing. Using computers we save trees and stop all that from happening. She one reason why think computers are a positive impact on love and society. Secondly learning you can learn a lot on a computer all you have to do is look for it. I learn many things each day at school because of the help of computers and I feel that is computers are use it can excellour learning and @MONTH1 been a lot more in a lot shorter time then we would have my to find a book or the subject what youre looking for. Computers have made things a lot impact on children but we all new things I when we use computers. So computers are a good thing and a bad thing. Finaly you can talk and interact with friends. techknowlogy has advanced so much that we don't see the world in prospective like take a cell phone for example what do you see mostly likly a phone. But if you open it up what to do you find? You will find a micro computer thats capable of surfing inter playing music just smaller size then before. computers revolutronized the way we look at the world and techknowlogy we can talk and play games usiing this techknowlogy most of what we see every day used with techknowlogy hike, a game station or even a car rardo. adn all of it is used to help using ract with one on toher. So I veiw techknowlygy a so good thing. In conclusion techknowlogy has a positive and negative impact by more positive than negative influence. Techknowlogy help us in our everyday lives and helps save the environment by letting us talk and save paper just by button. Techknowlogy has revolunoized the wat mankind lives and how they veiw society but it us all a good thing in the end. And so I concluded that techknowlogy/computers have a positive and negative impact on socuoty.",4,4,0
16,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, The computer blinked to life and an image of a blonde haired girl filled the screen. It was easy to find out how life was in @LOCATION2, thanks to the actual @CAPS1 girl explaining it. Going to the library wouldn't have filled one with this priceless information and human interection. Computers are a nessessity of life if soceity wishes to grow and expand. They should be supported because they teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk to others online. Firstly, computers help teach hand eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is a useful ability that is usod to excel in sports. In a recent survey, @PERCENT1 of kids felt their hand eye coordination improves after computer use. Even a simple thing like tying can build up this skill. Famous neurologist @CAPS2 @PERSON1 stated in an article last week that, ""@CAPS3 and computer strength the @CAPS2. When on the computer, you automatically process what the eyes see into a command for your hands."" @CAPS4 hand eye coordination can improve people in sports such as baseball and basketball. If someone wan't to become better in these sports, all they'd need to do was turn on the computer. Once people become better at sports, they're more likely to play them and become more healthy. In reality, computers can help with exercising instead of decreasing it. Additionaly, computers allow people to access information about faraway places and people. If someone wanted to reasearch @LOCATION1, all they'd need to do was type in a search would be presented to them in it would link forever to search through countless things. Also, having the ability to learn about cultures can make peole peole and their cultures, they understand others something. Increase tolerance people are. Computers are a resourceful tool that they can help people in every different aspect of life. Lastly, computer and in technology can allow people to chat. Computer chat and video chat can help the all different nations. Bring on good terms places other than can help us understand story comes out about something that happend in @LOCATION3, people can just go on their computer and ask an actual @LOCATION3 citizen their take on the matter. Also, video chat and online conversation can cut down on expensive phone bills. No one wants to pay more than they have to in this economy. Another good point is that you can acess family members you scaresly visit. It can help you connect within your own family more. Oviously, computers are a useful aid in todays era. their advancements push the world foreward to a better place. Computers can help people because they help teach handeye coordination, give people the bility to learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with others. Think of a world with no computers or technologicall advancements. The world would be sectored and unified, contact between people scare, and information even. The internet is like thousands or librarys put together. Nobody would know much about other nations and news would travel slower. Is that the kind of palce you want people to live in?",6,6,1

Computers are usefull when trying to explore @CAPS1 places. One can book a flight anywhere in a matter of minits on a computer. How else would it be possible to travel somplace far away without booking a flight on a computer. Next, computers help learn about different coltures. Once one has booked reservations to a certain travel spot on thier computer, they will learn much about the unfamiliar land they have went to. My family has gone to many different areas around the world. The trips would not have been possible without help researching and making flights with the computers. The computer makes it possible to experience to territorys. It is a key item when someone is looking to travel. A computer is emensly important when trying to communicate with friends. People can meet and make friends very simply using websites such as facebook on the computer. Facebook creats friendship very easily. I recently waited to get to know a students better. I looked him up on facebook and now we are aqetances. Next, programs on the computers such as A.I.M. help people communicate about anything such as homework to other personal topics. Lastly, if one wants to get to know another better he or she can look at thier blog. They @MONTH1 start to talk and become good friends. Computers are usfull when trying to comunicate or find friends. Computers not only help with travel and friends but it also helps with ones hand eye cordination. Typing letters while looking at a screen is using the hand eye coordination. This action can help with sports. For example in baseball one must have a good hand eye cordination to help catch and hit the ball. Secondly, with hand eye cordination getting better with the computer. it helps kids fit in. If one has good hand eye cordination they can play sports are make friends. If one becomes good with hand eye cordination and typeing they will be able to get a job writing for a newspaper or a book. Hand eye cordination and typing with computers can lead to a succesfull life. Computers in an @CAPS5 life can help in the long run. It will help with travel plans, friends, and hand eye cordination.",5,5,1

Computers have a positive effect because you can communicate with other people around the world. This is good because instead of calling people you can go on computer and talk to them for free. Long distance phone calls cost a lot. But if you can just go on your computer and talk to them there's going to be no charge. Being able to talk to other people over the internet is very useful and fun. If there wasnt a computer people would be talking to as much people and there social life would be bad making there life not as exciting. This is one reason why I think that computer have a positive effect on people. Another reason why computers give a positive effect in people if you have a lot of paperwork that is just lieing around is in the way. Well if you have a computer there are featers that your able to store thing and because much more organized. Being more organized there is less stress one you start to feel better about lossing things and being able to find them. This is why I think that computers are very great and useful. The last reason why I think that computers have a positive effect on people is that people can use it for entertainment. Computers can do many things like play game, listen to music, watch videos, and chat with your friends. Being able to play games for free on your computer is awesome. If you cant aford to get a game system them you are able to go on your computer and play pretty much what ever game or close to the game that you want to play. A computer can also play music. You can have @CAPS1 and download musics to something or go to web sites that have musical on them. Also you can do video chats with your friends if they live far away.

Being able to play games, store thing, and chat with other people is pretty amazing.",5,4,1

I believe this because we can talk to people in different countries in a quarter of a second, we can send e-mails to other people, and finally we can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. First, we can talk to people in different countries. Did you ever have a relative go on vacation in a foreigh country and have no way of calling them to see if everything is okay? Lets say for instance that they brought their laptops but for at their cellphones. Then, the only way we can contact them is by e-mail. Even if your just happens in you can keep in touch through email. You can even a computer so you can video chat, and not have to wait to get your reply. Next, we can send e-mails to other people. Have you ever set somebody a letter by mail and had to wait two to three days for a reply? Sometimes, your letter is even lost, and these is no way of finding out. Well with e-mail, the wait time of your reply depends on how fast the person whom you are talking to types and most people I know can type a reply in @NUM1 to @NUM2 seconds. I believe that is a from two to three cars. With e-mail those is an eghty three percent chance that your email will not be lost. If for some reason it is lost, there will be a message sent to you telling you that your message was lost and that you need to sent a new message. But most likely chances are that your message wil reach its destination. can go to @LOCATION1, ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. Were you ever wondering about something and the answer was on the tip of your tongue but you just cant think of it? If so you probably would be smart to go to @LOCATION1. You can ask @CAPS1 question and get an instant reply. And I mean @CAPS1 question you can ask questions from wat the price of is in @LOCATION2, to what an is. If you wanted to you could ask math questions as well, such as what is the square root of pi, and what is @NUM3. From @LOCATION1 to myspace the internet is full of information that can have a positive effect on people. This is why I think that the has a positive effect on people, we can talk to people different countries we can send e-mails, and we can ask all sorts of questions.",5,5,1
1440,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, it has come to my attention that more and more people use computer, but not everyone agrees that this benefits the society. I strongly believe that computers do benefit society for three reasons. First, computers are a great source to do school work on. Computers let you learn more information. In addition, computers are a great way to keep in touch with friends and family. Clearly you can see why computers have positive effects on people and society. My first reason why I believe computers benefit society is because computers are a great source to use do school work with. An example of this would be if a science teacher gave their class an assainnment to do that had to be typed. Its impossible to type an essay without a computer. Further more, if the project or assignment needs to have information looked up and their is no time in your day to go to a library, the computer is a great source. Now doesn't that make sense? Computers don't just help you with homework, but many people go to college online also. My parents don't have enough money to afford me to go to college, ""says @NUM1-year old @PERSON1,"" so I take free course online and they work great! ""@CAPS1 it obvious that computers have a good effect on people? In addition to schoolwork, computers are a great place to look when you need information. For example, you have just bought a new house and want to know more about that area. The computer is an great place to look at updated pictures, and learn about your new hometown. Sixty-nine percent of people use information from the computer to buy a home. People @MONTH1 also want to learn basic information about bears or bees is my belief that the computer is a great source to do learn infromation obviously, computers have a great effect on people and it benefit society. Lastly, computers are helpful ways to keep in touch with family and friends. ""I have my whole mom's side of the family living in @LOCATION1. When I get to use the computer to keep in touch with them. I feel closer and part to keep in touch with them. i feel closer and part of one big happy family,"" @PERSON2 of @STATE1, @NUM2, says. People who have family living in other states, countries and even other countries, don't get to see eachother every day of the year @CAPS2 is why computers can help, the people keep in touch. Another example would be if your mom or dad went away for a few days, weeks or months and you wanted to talk to them of ten. A good way to do that would be using email or instant messaging. Therefore, i strongly believe that computers are great for people and do benefit the society. to sum it all up, computers benefits society and have possitive effects on people. Computers are great sources to do school work, they give you information your looking for, and are great ways to keep in touch with family and friends. Clearly you can see why I strongly believe that computers have a strong and possitive effect on people and benefit the society. Thank you!",5,5,1
1140,"Computers are the future. Computers are the best technology we've created. They allow us to improve our hand-eye coordination, learn about faraway people and places and what with our friends. Computers improve our hand-eye coordinations typing is a good way to improve this vital skill by not looking and knowing which buttons are where. Using a mouse is also a good to improve by moving the digital mouse with the one in your hand. This can improve foster writing, because you are moving the friend in your hand the same way you would move a mouse or type. This can also help driving, because you can't look at the wheel, you have to keep your eyes on the word, and in order to do that you most know how you're moving the wheel. Computers can help hand-eye coordination which can help with writing and driving, with typing and and moving a mouse. Computers can increase our knowledge about faraway places, and people. Cultures come in a variety we can learn about all of them from the comfort of our own home. We can also learn about nature from our home. Learning about different cultures can teach us many things. Like what kind of clothes they wore, food they ate, place the, lived in. This allows us to change our own culture by getting inspired from others. Learning about new places can help broaden the mind about other spots in the world that can lead to a vacation. Lastly, computers allow us to internet with friends from our chairs. Chatting, and e-mailing and video chatting are all great ways to interact. With a webcam you can even see the other person as if you here face-to-face with them. You can also e-mail important files, such as pictures, docucuments, and even videos. This can help with someone's job. In conclusion, computers can teach us hand-eye coordination, can teach us about faraway places and people, and lets us interact and share with friends. Computers are a very important part of my life.",4,5,0
486,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 much do computers affect our life? I have always thought of that question. Technology is getting up to the roof and it makes our life more easier, but have you ever thought that maybe technology might take people's work? In everyday of our live we see something new that comes out and becomes an easy tool for us. But what about us? Since technology come out people has become not the same; for example cars, by having them people doesn't walk and not even exersice, they don't spend too much time with their family and friends and lastly people miss thousands of wonderful things that happend outside. I just think that technology like computers take a whole quater of our life by mostly doing the work for us. First, have you ever, notice that people get obiese so fast? I know the answer to that question. The obesitity in @LOCATION1 is getting worst, people are getting fattier by just been in a cautch and sitting with a computer and eating, what exersise are they doing there? People doesn't exersise anymore, instead of them playing games like, soccer, volley-ball, baseball or even running, @CAPS3!! They are at the computer playing games that doesn't do anything good. I have asked people about what they think about this and this is what a woman answer, "" I htink that people doesn't think about their health, they just think to make life easier"". I agree with her; obisitty could bring you to the hospital and you don't want that. Second, have you ever asked your self about @CAPS2 much time you ever spend with friends and family? Well think of that. Maybe you got a computer because you were spending too much time outside bu not with your family, but you can see that you're probably most of the time at home since you bought your computer, but not with your family. Spending time with your family is so important because you might miss so many wonderful things. For example family parties, or just watching a show on the t.v. I just think that spending time with your family is important. Lastly, if you are a parent and you are too much in a computer, won't you feel bad if something happend with your son/daughter? In everyway we always miss wonderful things, and sometimes we loose it because of technology, you don't want that right? Imagen you are at the computer and your daughter said her first word won't you feel bad if you missed that? I would. Always give time to life because maybe one day you might hate your self for missing so many wonderful things. In conclusion, so many people have become addicted to computers, they just can't lieve it alone. Imagen that you become one of them. You becoming obise, not spending time with family and missing wonderful things that the world provides us. I hope you understand that technology is not everything in life.",4,5,0

Computers are growing into the human lifesyle. Computers help you re-connect with people. My mom uses facebook and she found friends she hasn't seen since the early @NUM1's!

1142,"Dear @PERSON1, @CAPS1 you know that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 spend to much time on their computers. I belive people should spend more time outside with their family. This can certainly lead to brain problems, hard time seeing and the biggest thing is death. First of all there are people with brain problems because they are on the computer to much. When they are out with their family they think of their computer. People stay on their computer for a non-stop amount of time. In a resent survey it showed that teenagers stay on the computers the most. Most people don't have a life outside their computer room. Most of all eye doctors have been getting call from parents. They are worried that their child/children have a hard time seeing. I interviewed an eye doctor and this is what he had to say, ""I had one child come into @CAPS3 office and he had the hardest time seeing"". He asked the kids mother why is he having a hard time seeing and she said, ""@CAPS3 son spends on average of three and a half hours on the computer."" The child had to get a pair of special glasses so that he could see better. These glasses aare really expensive. I have read about children and adults deing from using the computer to much. They have fried their brain from using the computer to much. Their brain tells them to do things that are illegal. For example: breaking in homes, killing people, and high sacking cars. I heard one kid used the computer to much that he started to kill people and got shot by a cop. The more people die from using the computer to much the higher the death toll will be. It is now or never @CAPS3 friends out there to work together on cutting down on how much we use the computer. I'm sure that no one wants to be part of the death toll until we really have to. It is time to go outside and have fun with your family. They miss spending time with you. So get off your butt and go outside. But wait, make sure you trun your computer off so that you are not temted to go back on it.",4,4,0
1011,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home? Right now, more than @PERCENT1 of the people have at least one or more computers at home. Computers are common by now, but people argue rather they are really needed on our society. Computers give negative effects on people, for example, lose eye sight, interacting with strangers online and lack of outdoor exercise. One out of five people wear glasses or contacts, these days. the rate of people wearing glasses are increasing rapidly as well. Children and adults are spending too much time on the computer, which causes to lose eye sight. When people use too much computers, their eyes start to hurt and lead to a headaches as well. These are sign of spending too much time, but people tend to ignore it because they want to get work done, or simply addicted to the online video games. this shows that computers give terrible effects on society. When a person is on the internet, there is no limitation to him or her. Once a person is online, there are endless amounts of site to access on that are not always trusted. Online, where anyone can go on, there are millions of people that are not connected or related. In other words, strangers, interacting with people they don't know is very dangerous. They can have devastating influence, no supremacy, what so ever unless they are a teacher of same sort. Unfortunatly, people can not trust anyone online because they don't know who it exactly is. For example facebook. People think they are private, but everything that is uploaded or posted is public. Also others will be able to view your profile even they are not friends with that person. this is not safe in any way. The rate of people getting addicted on the internet is increasing as well. These people tend to not go outside at all and stay home. These people get not enough exercises, which are very unhealthy they tend to get their meals done at fast foods which are unhealthy as well. For the reason, people on the computers get fat from the unbalanced meal and never interact with people outside and nature outside. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on society because, they increase the number of people wearing glasses and losing eye sight. Second, they are creating a unsafe environment. last it makes people have unbalanced meals and lose track of their diet. ",4,4,0
1129,"Dear local Newspaper, This eara are all about computers. Computers @CAPS1 a benefit to have. It increase the hand-eye coordination, talking skills and easy knolage. My first paragraph @CAPS1 about hand-eye coordination. This @CAPS1 a important skill because it helps with physical movements, using your hands for example. Studys have shown that @NUM1 out of the @NUM2 have improved hand-eye coordination. Also it help kids @CAPS1 that it stimulates the nerves in the hands and brain for kids that have had sergery on there hands. Last years study has shown that @PERCENT1 of kids have improved hand movement faster than regular therpy. Secondly. The importance of computers have been commucation like email or aim. This @CAPS1 great for penpals because it saves time for responses from mail and money because there @CAPS1 no mailing to places and when you email them there will be a fast responce. Also this will help people that are shy around people. A study has shown that @PERCENT2 of shy kids have increased the talkative skills in school. Also most talkative skills will help kids today with there confidence. Finaly, the computer @CAPS1 a helpful knolage tool to use. Most book will be more chalanging to find because there @CAPS1 allways extra information that @CAPS1 not needed and will take longer to find. With a computer all you need to do @CAPS1 to type in what info your looking up. ""@CAPS1 an easy sensation"" said time magazine. That was one great comment from time. In school however there are helpful tips that are making it eager and easyer to find with bookmarks that you can find that are faster because all there @CAPS1 to do @CAPS1 go up to bookmarks and find the websight and click and thats it.

1319,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effect of computers are that, it depends on how much you use the computer. But I think the computer has a possitive effect on people. Why because it has made us kids homework easier to do, and fun sites you can check out. Even for adults when they need to look up something important they can automatically find it in the computer. First reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is because it makes @CAPS1 homework easier, instead of getting it from a book I can get it from @CAPS1 computer. Trust me it's much easier than reading all those types of books when you have a computer. Then you can just type in what you want and it would automatically pop up for you. For example, when you have an essay to right about @PERSON1 @LOCATION1. All you have to to is go to @CAPS2.com and all types of past @CAPS2 would show up. Then you go to search and put in @LOCATION1 then all this @CAPS2 of him comes out. So you get the right information that's an easy A+ for you. Second reason why I think the computer has a positive effect on people is all the sites you can go on and play games or go on youtube, or myspace. It's alot of things you can do on a computer to have some fun. For, example, say you don'@CAPS3 want to play your game or watch @CAPS3.V, or go outside. What do you do, get on your computer. So you can check your myspace page or watch funny videos or maybe talk to some of your friends online. Think about it, you can'@CAPS3 do none of those things on your @CAPS3.V or your game and especially not outside so that's why I think a computer has a positive effect on people. Lastly, I think the computer has a positive effect on people because even adults like to get on computers. Half of every adults job has an computer that they have to use either to cash a check on a computer or teachers to put in grades and scientist to look up different experiments. For example a teacher alway's have to use their computer to put in grades or see what us kids need help on or how far we got and how far behind we are. So it makes it easy on adults as well. In conclusion, those were the reasons why I think computers has a positive effect on people.",5,4,1
1700,"What is technology? Technology is defined as anything that helps enhance our way of living. Technology is all around us. Our beds, houses, televisions and even chairs are all forms of technology. There is one form of technology however, in my opinion, has revolutionized modern day living as we know it. This form of technology is called the computer. My outlook on the effect the computer has had on our society is quite positive. Just think of all of the things we rely on this device to do. There is one thing, however that really sticks out in my mind; @CAPS1. The computer is perhaps the greatest form of @CAPS1 the world has ever seen. E-mail is basically sending a letter to a friend without the hassle of mailing it out where it might get lost or stolen. E-mailing is two simple steps: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. Not only does it lower the risk of the letter not getting there, but it is also much quicker. You hit the ""sen"" button and before you know it, a new letter is sitting in you friends inbox. Another method of computerized @CAPS1 is my personal favorite, instant messaging. Instant messaging allows you to have a conversation with someone that could be miles away. And it's okay if you decide to go get a soda while you are instant messaing because unlike a real conversation, that isn't rude. These are just two methods of @CAPS1 that the computer enables us to have. Tehre is a variety of other that, much like these two, enhance our way of life. I believe that the main reason the computer has enhanced our life so much is because of one giant thing: the internet. The internet makes everything we do on the computer possible. If i want to gon on the computer and do research on a topic, the internet takes me where i want to go. With millions of different websites, the internet has endless possibilities. If I'm interested in arcade games, I can go on the internet and play them. If i have to write a science report, then i can go on the internet and collect research. If i want to listen to music, tehn i can go on the computer, look up a song, and listen to it. And guess what? If i'm looking for a funny video just for a good laugh, then the internet can find me one! The internet is perhaps one of the greatest things ever invented. It's just another reason to love the computer.",4,5,0
373,"To whom it @MONTH1 @CAPS1, I have recently heard about your argument on the effects that modern day computers have on society. Some people feel they have a positive effect, such as learning new information, and interacting or chatting with other people. Others feel that society is devoting to much time to computers, they feel that these people are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and with their family. I feel that people are devoting themselves to the computer. People think that all things on the internet are true, they're not, @PERCENT1 of all teens across the country are addicted to the computer. First, things posted on the internet are not always true. They can be posted by anyone, whether it's true or not. My friend found a website with very detailed information for an essay. She turned it in, and the teacher gave it back the following day. In big red letters it said ""false information"" @CAPS2 she had gotten the information from a book. she pobably would've gotten an ""A+"". Second, @PERCENT1 of teens living in the @LOCATION1 have become addicted to using the computer. My friend was obsessed with facebook from @NUM1 until @NUM2 she was on, daily. She began failing classes. She didn't do homework, didn't study for tests! She failed the @NUM3 grade. This all happened because she was addicted to a website. This is why I agree with the statement that experts are concerned with people spending to much time on the computer @CAPS2 you want to continue a healthy lifestyle, and avoid becoming to addicted to the computer, limit yourself. Make the smart choice.",4,4,0
1071,"Dear local newspaper, I think that using a computer can benifit people and have a negative on people. Benifits could be, gaining knowledge, and meeting new people, bad effects could be, weight gain, and having a lack of social skills to talk with friends over phone etc. First, gaining knowledge is really essential. The I think that is because when your computer crashes or breaks you would most likely know what to do to fix it. I dont think you would want to have to pay money to get anti software that probubly doesn't work. Anothe reason why I think that gaining using computer is good because what if you want become a computer enginere, all that time you've spent on the computer could really benifit you later on in life. Secondly I think that computers could help you meet new people from foreign countries and other states. Not you have to meet them in person you could just have a friendly consversation online. The thrid and last reason why sometimes computers can be bad for you is weight gain. Most are probably so much time on the computer that there not getting enough physical activities. All they do is sit down eat on unhealthy snack and play games, and videos. That's really bad for your health. I conclusion using a computer moderately is a lot better then using a lot. It could help gain knowledge, meet new people or make you gain weight and have a lack of social skills.",4,4,0
1688,"Dear Local newspaper, I have concerned because lately a lot of people have been using computers alot. My concern is that they haven't been exercising much, they arent enjoy nature and they aren't spending much time with their family. This is not a posiitve way for their life. In my opinion excercising is a very, very, very important thing to do. This is because you need to mantain a healthy diet to stay healthy and you need to excersise. Some people I know don't exercise and they are either overweight or not healthy. People are ""busy"", as they say, uisng the computer to do all there work because they just don't like using the old fashion way, which is going to your job and doing your work. Everything is different now and people have become lazyier than ever before. Would people be lazy, if computers weren't around? Of course they wouldn't be. They would have a happy healthy life. Now-a-days, people don't go out and explore the world much they just go online and nthey search a place up on a google. They don't see the real thing though. they see pictures and everybody knows that seeing the real thing is way, way better than looking at a picture. But i guess everyone forgot about that. Computers have everything online, no wonder poeple don't want to leave their homes and if they do leave, don""t worry they have a laptop with them. Computers are even portable go wherever they go their still going to go online. Poeple have also spent less time with family because they could talk to them online in a s chat room. This isn't a good thing because what if you were talking to your ""mother"", well at least you think is your mother but is someone else and your talking about your, I didn't know, something private and that person on the other computer, ""your mother"", will know about that and can cause problems with you. You know waht I mean? Like if you were talking about your credit card and that person asked you for your credit card number and you gave it to them then they could cause problems. Online isn;t a safe place, thats why you should talk in person not on a chat room. Well I hope that you put my letter in the newspaper for people could exercise, see the nature and be with family, like they were when they didn't have computers around.",4,4,0
1381,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have a negative effect on people. One reason I think this is because people need exercis. They shouldn't be sitting at a desk all day playing games on the computer. Especially kids should be outside playing and exercising. More and more people will become obess if all they do is sit at a computer all day and eat junk food. If more people execis more people will start eating the right food and many people will be much healthier and live healthier and happier lives. My second reason on why I think computers are negative is some kids @MONTH1 get cyberbullied. This is when someone gets bullied online. Kids do this so they don't have to say it in person and they could say anything they want and the other person @MONTH1 not even know who it is. Another thing is kids @MONTH1 meet someone they don't know and think is nice but you don't know who he really is. He could make you, by tricking you, do stuff that normally you wouldn't do cause you think he's your age or he likes you. Many girls have gotten taken because of this. My last reason is people could miss out on fun activities, with family or friends like going swimming in the @DATE1 or sleding in the winter. If your home at the computer you can't do fun activities outside and exercis while doing it. Theses are my reasons I think computers have a negative effect on people.",4,4,0
278,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers effect people in a positive way. Computers increases our knowlage, lets us communicate with our friends and family, teaches us hand-eye coordination, and lets us see our news faster. Computers are enjoyable, great pieces of technology. Even though sitting down looking at your computer screen is not very interactive, computers increase our knowlage. Computers have all these websites that are full of great information. You can look up anything you would like to learn about and find exactly what you want. Going to the library for a book on your report would consume extra time. Instead you can look up the facts you need online. Computers also let us communicate with family and friends. Calling someone or sending a letter costs money, but sending on email to someone does not. Many people have family and friends that live far away from them. Through computers they can talk to them as long as they want at no expense. You can also see each other through a webcam. Which you can attach to your computer if it has not have in one allready. Another reason why computers are useful is because they help with hand-eye coordination. Computers require you to type, which is a great skill. While working out an essay by hand is tiring and boring you can type up the essay on you computer. Typing takes to get good at but is very helpful. Finally Computers help us get our news foster. When major things happen, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 it was all over the internet before the news.

People get on and never get off, you never no who it is your chating with online, and they can cause tons @MONEY1 stress. Let me explain why computers can ruin lives. When the computer was invented I'm sure this wasn't the purpose. To stay on playing mindless games, or randomly searching the web.

Also it is just flat out a waste @MONEY1 time when you could be outside playing a @CAPS3 game. My second reason is that when you are ""chatting"" or ""@CAPS4'ing"" someone, who is it really?

When your on @CAPS6 or @CAPS7, nasty fueds between friends can occur that affect you and your school work, inflicting damge to your grades. For every @NUM2 people when join a social page, @NUM1 get worse grades do to this issue. Also when your parents are online for a long time, the next morning they must rush to get ready for work and are tired, afffecting their quality @MONEY1 work.

Even simple things like a virus or a slow upload could and will cause stress, in fact @PERCENT2 @MONEY1 @LOCATION1 have a stress issue due to computers. I've told you today why computers are bad. They get sucked in stressed out and stalked. Now computers aren't all bad, just use them right. These are the reasons I think computers can be bad.",6,5,1
1083,I think that using computer is fine. Reason why I think you have family from far away. Instead of talking hearing voice on the phone. They can talk to each other but most of all see each other. Show cool thing you have that are new. When you have a love one you can see them when there a way for a trip. Computer are helpful when your car is broken down or when you have no car. You can buy stuff at store by the comfort of your home. Almost everything you can get stuff out of store because they have online store to mail to you. Also now you can buy food on internet and lots more. Saving money computer tell you where to get good prices to save money. Lots of dating sites to meet diffent people to go out and give your commets. Texting on facebook can let you save money by texting for free. Playing free online games with your friends. You can make website and you can watch movie and show online. There just a lot of thing you can do on a computer. I know lots of people don't go outside exercise but I agree with some expert. Lot of people need to lose weight or need to go outside more to the real world. This techology people are big they don't go out more. They eat lots of food. But computer are very helpful in lots of way and its so fun. Those are my reason why I think that computer are great and sould be used more.,3,4,0
544,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people, are that computers are used for the wrong reasons. Teens should be outside playing sports or hanging out with friends and family. But instead they are addicted to the world wide web and games and websites throughout it. Therefore, the computer and the concept of surfing the web is bad because it consumes childrens much and because educationally computers can give the wrong information. Until the late @DATE1's, @ORGANIZATION3 laptops and desktop @CAPS2 did not exist in @CAPS1 opinion, this would have been better. For example. children teens and even adults use the computer more than they should nowadays. At this age middle schoolers and high-schoolers should be focused on their grades and their . But instead, they get too addicted to @CAPS3, @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 that they forget about their school work and their priorities, and their grades start to slip. Even sudlts have this problem. For instance, buisness people, accountants and assistants will consistently be checking their emails. Also, people who work at a desk or in a cudical all day are almost always on the computer. In other words, I believe that jobs should cut dwn on how many workers they have on a computer, and family homes should cut down on the amount of time each member spends online. Another reason I think computers effect people in a bad way is because educationally computers can give false information. For example, people could insect their own perspective of an idea on websites such as wikipedia and @ORGANIZATION2. If a student was doing a project or just homework and decided to surf the web for some @ORGANIZATION2 or information they dont know if their information is correct. I believe this means that the internet and the web don't beat books or history. In conclusion, computers have a bad effect on people for the reasons of it consumes children and teen's minds, people use the internet too much and because educationally computers can sometimes give false information.",4,4,0
611,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have @NUM1 reasons why computers effects have on people. First, computers are not good for your eyes. Second, the reason why people get on computers a lot. Third, there are so much games and places to go like myspace, facebook and even twitter and much more. Keep on reading so I could tell you all about my three reasons. First of all, computers are not good for your eyes because computers are like @CAPS3's is the something but not really because computer as more information and @CAPS3 dont really got so much information you could browse for. My second reason is that the more people be on computers the more blind they could get just for being on the computers for a hour or more. Third, some people dont even dare if they be on ocmputer they wont they might think that just becaus ethey wear gasses they wont get blinder but they are wrong they will get more blinder. As you reading you will find out my second reason fro being to much in the computer. My second reason, is that why people get in computers alot well peopel get on computers just to their or do their taxes but that is not good because just because your doing your bills or your taxes you  to alot of information that people in other countries or state could get without you knowing , second is that people or get on computers to pay their bills or do their taxes they also get on the computer to maybe order something or buy a ticket to fly to a place they want to go like a vacation place or a business trip. my third reason is that they not only buy or order things but thet get in websites that will make their lives better like meeting soembody special or something else. As you keep reading you will find out my third reason for being to much and so long in the computers. My third reason, is that their are alot of activities to do in the computer for a example myspace, facebook and twitter are the most popular website that people get in just to meet new people and talk to old friends. In conclusion, people should not be on computer too much because of their health and their privacy and also to be sure not to meet strange people. ",4,5,0
337,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 well @CAPS1 many others, i believe computers are not only good, but beneficial. Computers are advanced our world little by little every day. We all use them for communication, entertainment, and knowledge. Computers are like people with fun to do and things to learn. Computers are beneficial to everyone worldwide. Computers gradually advance communication more and more everyday. It used to be old letters by mail, then it became e-mails, twitter, and facebook. These websites upgrage communication today. Long distance friends can view photos, information, videos, and chat from far away. Some site like @ORGANIZATION2 allow you to instant message your friends. Lastly, video chatting is a new improved way to see a live video of the other person. According to @ORGANIZATION1 @NUM1 more user signed up for web-cams since the beggining of @DATE1. Communication is positively affected by computers. I know you @MONTH1 have fun with sports or nature, but sometimes it is great to get great entertainment for yourself instantly. Computer games only cost about @MONEY1 and are instant access. Also, surfing the web for news or funny videos is fun sometimes. Almost everyone who has a @CAPS2 gets a blast surfing the internet. Do you ever wonder how to hear the song you like when it's not on the radio? Itunes stores, organize, and plays music in a virtual library for permanent access. What also happens is youtube allows you to watch music videos or hear songs for free. Now thats why computers are straight entertainment. Finally, computers provide you with so much knowledge and is great for education. Certain websites let you access tons of knowledge. Wikipedia and diccionary.com are great for learning.",5,5,1
908,"Knoleg is one of the greatest quests for mankind, always trying to figure out how and why things happen. @CAPS1 to this natural ciricusity we have made amazing leaps in Technology @NUM1 years ago what seemed to be imposible is now possible. And one of those many thought to be impossible was to find anything you want in only a matter of seconds. I think computers are a great benafate to society becaus, you can learn things around the world in the blink of an eye, allow you to talk to people around the world and @CAPS5 give you better hand eye cordenation. The first reson I think that computers are great modern society, is that we can learn instantly about foren countrys. @NUM1 years ago the only way you could learn about places far away was if you read it in a newspaper, many which didn't tell you about faraway lands. Now with the internet we can learn around the world what is happening ware you want to know.

""@CAPS9 this technology many of the decisions made in @LOCATION1 and @CAPS10 wouldn't be made and many solders would have died as a result."" @CAPS11 final reson that I support this decision is that they help teach you hand eye coordination. One of the ways that computers teach hand eye coordination is throug video games and simulations. In video games people make it @CAPS7 you to react at a movements notes in order to compleat your objective. In the @ORGANIZATION1 computer simulations teach the soldiers how to react to many different situations. Through this situations, many sledres have learn how to servive in combat and save many of their fellow comredes.

819,"Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. I think oposite though. I think this way because you @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer one day. Some jobs you have to apply by computer. Another thing is a computer allows you to talk online with other people. The first reason why I think using a computer is good for people is because you @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer one day. What I mean by this is you might have to look up a job, you might want to get away so you look up vactions that you can take or you might have to pay a bill one day. The second reason why I think using a computer is good is because some jobs you have to apply by computer. Such as stop and shop, price right, and save-alot. To add on to that this is good for are society because if we use paper thats killing more trees. The third reason why I think using a computer is a good because this allows you to talk online with other people. Therefore you @MONTH1 need to contact a family member or even an old friend, meet new people or you might not like to talk on the fone, so you rather talk by computer. Now I told you all the reasons why I think using a computer is good. @MONTH1 have to look up something on the computer, some jobs you have to apply by computer, lastly allows you to talk online with other people.

671,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I felt shoeked to see that there are people that beileve that computers don't benefit society and after hearing that I felt compelled to share my opinions. They help socitey. They help us communicate, do important thing have fun. Computers help us communicate in many ways. We all want to talk to our freinds, but we can not be with our freidns all the time, so there is she internet to help us. We also all have freinds we don't see very often, but we still want to talk to them so with is intenet we can talk to them as long as we went. Computers also help us make new freinds. They can also ehlpo us have fun. Computers are fun for many different reasons. Social networking sites, like facebook or myspace, are fun to be on. There are many fun things to do or the internet including video games, many video games consoles are attatched to the intenet so you can play with your freinds. But computers arent just all fun and games. Computers can transfer very important information including homework after schol activities. Computers also hold all of our governments information, from thingsas insignificant as plans for renovation on a town owned building to the department homeland security to the united states of without computers none of that would be possible.

1580,"Dear @CITY1 @ORGANIZATION1, I am a @ORGANIZATION2 student and I hear that some people think it is good to use computers and others think that its a waist of time. Well I have @NUM1 good reasons as to why computers are good technology. One reason is you can book places that you want to go or the sights you want to see. This is a good way to use the computer because you can track your route you can even print a map and go hiking. (hows that for excersing). Another reason why computers are good to use is because of online chats. Let's say that you have a family member that lives all the way out in @LOCATION1 and they have a computer and you want to talk to them but it costs you to talk, you can e-mail. This is a good way to use the computer because you can stay updated on what is going on with your family members. Another reason is learning. You can learn about many different cultures. You can learn about different people and how they live their life and ther cultures. My last reason is the @CAPS1. This is a great way to use the computer because you can keep updated on the lafest things like the earthquake in hati; or a hurricane or a @CAPS1 breaking story. Or if their is a storm headey your way. In conclusion, using the computer has great ways to be used and sure people, put some bad sights out their but if you use it the right way it is a good source of technology!",4,4,0
1601,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 reading your paper weekly and @CAPS2 up with local events, I was able to retrieve the information of a contreversy dealing with the effects of computers. I for one think that the computer was come to be one of the greatest inventions ever created. It was @CAPS3 changed our Society, and if you ask me, in a very posotive way. My first reason has to do with the knowledge that the computer possesses. You can practically discover anything in the blink of an eye, as opossed to a book or going to the library; which is very time consuming Not only does a computer take for less time to get information, it also holds a much large amount of information than a library can store. Computers hold knowledge on almost everything imaginable, but best of all, its right your fingertips. Another great characteristic of the computer, is it's ability to let people @NUM1 miles apart converse freely. This might just be the greatest thing about the computer. Chatting online completeley erases the hassel of @CAPS4 phone bills and carrying around cell phones, You can speak with friends half way around the world with no cost to you, amazing!!! The one thing that is faulty about the computer is it's overusage by children although this is a significant problem, it is not the computer's fault. Kids should no the limit. There should be @ORGANIZATION1 for both being on the computer and for excersise and fun with friends this problem has most likely influenced many to com to dislike the computer, but you must understand that the time children spend on the computer is entirely up to him/her or the parents. In @CAPS5 I hope I have persuaded you enough to agree with my thoughts and to give the computer a chance, im sure you'll be satisfied.",4,4,0
1109,"Dear Newspaper, Computers benefit society because they teach people. They are also helpful because they solve problem that humans might have trouble with. They can also entertain us when we have nothing to do. They can teach people many things. They can help tourist learn about a location they wish to travel to. Actually @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 tourist research the area there going to on a computer. They help students catch up or fully understand something. One time I was having trouble with fraction, in math. So I decided to look up the way to find the answer and it caught me up with the class again. The computer can explain cultures from any where in the world. According to culture digest.com @PERCENT1 of people visiting a new country. Find out about the culture first. Computers solve problems that some people might not now about.

1653,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever spent more than an hour at once on the computer? Computers have a negative affect on people! You could be damaging your sight, time should be spent playing outside, and it'll make it harder to talk to people in person. Do your eyes tend to hurt when your finally off the computer? Whether or not you playing games or typing articles your eyes @MONTH1 strain to keep up with a small font on a website. I remember the time when I read an online novel and my whole body was ready to go and play. Except for my eyes. Instead of playing sports games on the computer you should get up and play one outside!

1168,"Dear, newspaper writer I think the computer has a posative effect of people because @CAPS1 helps people around the world learn to speak a different language, @CAPS1 helps people talk to their friends around the world and @CAPS1 helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to write a letter and send @CAPS1 out to people they work for or to their bosses that need the report in by the end of the day. Those are the three reason that computers have a posative effect. @CAPS1 helps people learn to speak a different language without spending a lot of money like using rosetta stone you have to spend @NUM1 us dollars but online you dont have to spend a dime. the best part is that @CAPS1 is free. The slogan for rosetta stone is ""I have spent less money than months of formal classes."" I think their new slogan should be is "" we have a better learning company than anyone else."" That is why @CAPS1 helps people learn a different language. @CAPS1 also helps people by making @CAPS1 easier to talk to their friends you can aim, web cast, and ever text to make @CAPS1 easier @CAPS1 talk to friends on the internet. The reason they created that is so people dont have to travel to far away places and spend money to tell a friend important news that is only one thing. So in conclusion you dont have to spend a lot of money to tell a friend something. The third reason that the computer helps people is that people san e mail theor boss that they are faxing their final repoet to the big interview for a new position in the place where they work, @CAPS1 helps your boss by making @CAPS1 easier to read and @CAPS1 better because you could be in japan and your boss could be in florida @CAPS1 will take like @NUM2 minutes to get to your bosses computer. That is why @CAPS1 is easier to send messages to your boss.

And well when it comes to interacting with family the parents should set limits. Also computers are very convient, if you need information on a topic right away. So there far I think computers are not the one's at, in this perdevment. Exercising is somthing a perosn should have the ambition to do. @MONTH1 people don't have this they spend their day on the computer. they claim its not their faut. the computer is a you to play it. I read just last week that someone actolly told her press they it is not fault her over weight. Thats ! So the only person at full. for not getting the the gamer. As us family interaction goes, all up to the parents the use the parents are in control over they child and if they are that their kid doesn't spend enough time. The operator should have the will power to know when enough is enough and lay down the and set limits!. If we didn't have computers at home it would be a. Kids relie on computer them quick, accurate information. With not them the parents should their child to and from the library, and the time. And lets not forget the internet easy.

Things can fly over your head and you might not notice them. Have you ever ben on a computer for an hour. It might have felt you were on for @NUM1 minets. Many people ben on it for a hole day. You could of missed a year of stuff. New things like the new ipod nano with camra be invend and you would of not known. Also, the ipod. You could down load books andd read them on there. There also new things to try like jumping art of a plain or bungy jumpimg. You could be going to new place around the world. Traveling to @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 or even under water. Even going to @LOCATION2 and having a melting, warm, right of the oven tayst cheese pizza. My mouth is grulling for just thinking about it. How many people do you know. What about on facebook or myspace. @CAPS3 not you should go to the park. Meet some people. Just going to a family house, you can be interacting. Everyone should be interacting with someone. Even two year olds need to interact with other two year olds. Thats they learn how to share @CAPS2, your not two anymore but its good to know someone. Learning how others think too. You @MONTH1 think your way in good and the other erson way is not. Thats called interacting talking about it. @CAPS1 you might see on news how many familys have someone in the familys having weight problems. Meny shows like biggest losers @CAPS3 it chanels are trying to help these people lose weight. But what cams this? It could be not eating right, or not excresing right.

Other might rather stay on the computer and gain @NUM4 callories. And some deaths are around by a heart attack. This @MONTH1 caused by plack billed up or weight going. In sted of reaching for an apple many americans reach for that foods. I think we should still use computers but cut down the rtimes we use it and exercise and eat more. You might think after reading this letter. Thinking people wont lisen about excersing and meeting new people or palces. But, the one thing we can do is to at least insire one person. That person can inspire another person. This can go on and on. Little by little we can help people what they can do with out using an computer.",4,5,0
532,"Dear Local newpaper editor, I think computers benefits us in a good way. Weither computers are helping kids with research for homework, projects and essays or building online stocks to help make buisness grow. Computers are now a benificial way of life. We can see what happens on the other side of the world. And learn about new things everyday. What I think people are focusing is what they thikn computers are doing to people, but are really not focusing on how it helps us in so many ways. One way that people say computers effects people is that we don't exercise instead were attached to our computers. I doubt computers do this not everyone likes or wants to exercise. And why would computers stop people from doing that. It's people choice, the computer doesn't forces them to stay in the house. And computers are a great way for you to catch up with friends and family. It could be online chatting and even sharing photos. And I highly doubt people stop seeing their fmailies because of computers it just doesn't make any sense. People who are against computer are giving people in chairs or controlling them, it's just silly. If people acually stopped to take the time and think; theirs a chance that they would see how computers has helped us grow as a nation. And how much they used computers and that it really helped them than just searching through books for a ton of information. As years have gone by I could see that a ton of thinhs are runed by computers and that alot of people use them. And it has impacted our country, in my opinion a good way. And if it wasn't for computers who knows how are nation would be running. And if computers amde such a posotive impact on our country already I can only iamgine the years to come as computers become bigger and better. So as you have read I gave mt reason as how think computers impact our lives. And how I think the years to come it will impact our lives bigger and better. Now I can't force you to be for, or against computers bbut what ever your opinion is just think of a world without computers especially if you grew up with them.",4,4,0

I for one thing that computers are turning our society anti-social, we are becoming obese, and there is alot of cyber bullying that happens via computers. You can learn about all this and more if read on. @CAPS2 a stated earlier computers many problems in @LOCATION1's social lives. You see @CAPS2 much @CAPS2 @PERCENT1 of our population spends at least @NUM1 hours a ween on the computer. When doing this they are typically . watching videos or tweeting a friends. This @MONTH1 all swim like a activity but it is really pulling us away from our social lives. There are many sites that allow you to chat with your friends and leave messages on their ""wall"" but is that really communicating? In a way it is but it is taking away social skills that we will need later on. You can't get a job by instant messaging a person, you have to talk face to face. But how will we be able to do that if we only email and @CAPS3? Plus while so much you will be prone to using in , thus you with, nothing but a bad grade. Now we to problem that we see occuring all over . You the work on the computer. This activity what , they monitor, lets you at , everyday, since he comes home and plays on the computer and more time exercising. Finally we come to my last issue, cyber bullying. Over @PERCENT2 of @CAPS4 teens will be faced with some sort of cyber bullying in their life. When teens sion up for facebook and twitter they are signing up for depression. When a teen starts to get bullied they usually become sad which then leads them grades to go lower due to lack of concentration and that leads them to be more depressed and that could make them either commit suicide or join gangs and/or start making bad . But we can prevent this if we the of time people out @NUM2 spend on computers. And I think benifit that. In conclusion I believe that is we are bad for society. I think them is we the amount of time could be lives. I think that if you look deep down into what it to say how you will understand why we need to do healthier @LOCATION1? ",5,5,1
814,"Dear @CAPS1, I dont think that computers are something that people should be using @NUM1. Computers have something to them where somehow the become addictive. From the people who are gaining weight every day because the sit on the computer and chat all day. Then there are those terrible people on the internet who disguise themselfs so they look like a @NUM2 year old boy when there really a year old man. Lastly, people now a days are using the computer as a sorce of reading instead of books. I just think that computers are ruining the life of many people. For starters, most people today are becoming overweight because they either wacth to much @CAPS2, or they sit on the computer and eat all day. Once you start with the computer you'll never stop. Especially if your multi-tasking where you eat and use the computer. The big problem is people think it's better to be sitting home than out enjoying nature exercising! It really isn't good that people dont get of the computer and start enjoying life. Next not everyone online is who they say they are who make false accounts on like @CAPS3 or @CAPS4. There can be men who say there and really be @NUM3. With all the posting of pictures someone you with it. Just remember to be careful! Lastly, people in todays day in age use the computer to read books instead of going to the library or @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 (or any book store). I think that all those bookstores are going to run out of business because of the technology now a days. When I was younger and I said that I was going to read a book, I was really reading one. I wasn't reading it on the computer. People need to cut down on the electronics. In the end I think that computers are a real waste of time. There is no reason why people should be on the computer instead of exercise. Everyone needs to stay away from the bad people online. Also can we please start using normal books instead of online ones. I think computers need to stop taking over our world and start just being there when we need them.",4,4,0

They help you write reports or reports in general for any subject. Also, there many site that you could go to; to help you with a book.The sites could also bring you to your schools website. That way, if you forgot your home work was you have a place to check. Even if you were absent most papers I questions are on the internet so you could make end to the homework.

I disagree, computers can help keep family members that live far away in touch. You can also see pictures of things that you cant see everyday. Finally, it helps your school work. I know a family that has a son fighting in the @LOCATION1. He brought his laptop with him so he was ask to video chat with his family. It seemed as though he never left. Without it, his family would wonder how he was and be worried. You don't have to have a family member at war to talk to them on the computer. Have you ever wanted to see what @LOCATION2 looks like? You don't have to travel there to find out. All you have to do is search it on your computer! If you live in a city with not a lot of nature in it, you can see what its like outside it with the computer. Seeing those sights @MONTH1 make you to travel, travelling with your family brings you closer. A study shows @PERCENT1 of families that go on vacations have strong relationships. Having a computer is mandatory for school. It is the best thing to research with. @PERCENT2 of students that are failing don't use a computer for homework. There are also websites that you can use for studying. There is a student in my school that failed most of his classes. He never used a computer. His friend suggested using one at home if he was having trouble, which he tries. He used a computer to help study for a test he had the next day. He ended up getting a @PERCENT1 on the test because he used a computer.

65,"Dear Newspaper, People are spending way too much time on the computer and it is not right. They should be excercising, and interacting with friends and family. Having a computer also distracts them from schoolwork. Computers normally have effects like this on the people that use them. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1 people should be out getting exercise. The @LOCATION1 is one of the coubtries with the most overweight people. Many teenagers are inside all @DATE1 at the computer waiting for their friends screename to pop up so they can talk to them. They don't need to be completely gone, but while they're waiting for their friend they could be exercising. All they need to do is put on some fun music and start dancing around, that will get them the excercise they need for the @DATE1. They also could do ten pushups and twenty curlups, or even more if they wanted to. Instead of sitting at the computer all @DATE1 exercise. Having a computer effects the owner because they don't have a lot of face-to-face converstions with friends and family. You can call your friend up and have them come over your house instead. If they can be at home on the computer for hours then they probably can hang out in real life. Instead of videochatting with your cousins in another state, lan for them to come visit you guys one @DATE1. That way you can actually talk to them and see what they're doing to. You could also play board games, hide and seek, etc. It is much more fun to be with someone in real life, then to talk with them online. The last but deffidently not least effect that computers have on peoples lives is it distracts them from school. Once you start talking with one of your friends, it's pretty hard to stop. Many people don't know how to stop so they don't do the homework they were supposed to do, or they didn't study for the big test the @DATE1, therefore they end up failing it. Some kids will do homework and a on the computer at the same time, the homework is probably wrong because they weren't concentrating on it hard enough. Having a computer effects your life in many different ways, some positive and some negative. Some ways are it ""stops"" you from exercising, it doesn't let you have face-to-face interaction with friends and family and it distracts many kids from school.",5,4,1
516,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have recently heard about the debate on whether or not computers are used too often. Computers can be unhealthy, I think that generally they're helpful. They give us many oportunities that wouldn't exist without them. I'll describe more of what I mean in the following letter. First, I'll explain one of the advantages of computers. Studying and school work. Computers can provide people with ways to research things. For students, it @MONTH1 be something like research for a project of essay. For adults it could be information on starting a business. In both of those cases, computers were used to get information in a simpler way then perhaps visiting a library, I, personally, know of a website called @LOCATION1, where teachers can set up online tests for students. This would not be possible without computers. Computer online courses can even taken, where a student can be taugh through the internet, rather than in person. This can be an advantage to someone that can't always get to classes. I would also like to mention that computers provide a popular form of communication. E-mail and I @CAPS3. These methods of communication have become extreamly popular recently, and I myself use both. I think for some people it can be bad because it prevents them from interacting with the real world. But in general I think it's helpful. It also gives parents and teachers another way to communicate. These are just some of the many ways computers are helpful. Lastly, I'd just like to talk about how computers can benefit adults specifically. I know that many people pay their bills online. This is becaus if you think about it, isn't it a hassle to have to mail your bills every month? Computers greatly reduce that hassle. They can also make it easier to buy things you need, look for jobs, and many other things. Without computers, things like looking for jobs would require a lot more work than they do with them. These, again, are only some of the hundreds, if not thousands of ways which computers are helpful. In conclusion, I think I've made my point very clear. Any thing in moderation is okay. People that argue that computers are unhealthy speak of those who use computers too much. Generally this is not the case. Usually computers can do much more good than bad, and can make a persons life much easier. They help very much with education, and even that alone I think should be enough to convince you that computers are helpful. But as I said, I hope I made my point clear, and I hope you agree with me.",4,4,0

However either way they are still fast ways to contact a person far away. Jack from @LOCATION1 said ""@CAPS3 of video chat I was able to talk to and see my cousin from @LOCATION3 who I almost never see. This gos to show that the computer is a positive thing for people.

To prevent not getting enough exercise we should play sports or have family activities to atleast get out of our house. Everybody needs to stop being lazy and get active.

1254,"I do not agree that computers benefits society. There are threes big reason why computers are bad, people are getting to attached and arent spending time with there families. Others are gaining weight because they stay on the computer, and not exercising. Also some people arent getting fresh air not getting out for a walk in a park. Computers are making people shut out their families. When a girl wants to play with her big sister the big sister will just shut out the little sister and continue emailing her friends on the computer. Families need to stick together but when a member of the family from doing a family picnic or other family activities. Computers have addictive games that a person will play and ignore everyone and sometimes a family member can go into depression because he or she is being ignored. Another reason computers are bad is because of health issues. People will get to addicted and be lazy. They will just sit in the computer chair and eat drink bad stuff all day. People would gain weight might ever get dabetes from the weight. If people don't get the exercise they need to stay healthy then they might have heart problems, and many more serious conditions. If your weights gets to extreme then you might not be able to lose weight because your body has gotten tov used to all the weight your heart @MONTH1 not be able to take it. At last but not least people will stop going outside and not go and walk or talk, with friends. People should al least go outside once a day to see nature get air. They should go to the beach relax and relieve all the stress from computer games. Having to much stress is bad for your health you might go into depression. Being on the computer way to much can be bad if you sit in the dark not getting sunlight it can be bad for your eyes. So as you can see there is alot of bad things about computer. Most of the problems or issues all have to do something with someones health. So this is why I think this is bad for the societys benefits. I hope that you will take these reasons to heart.

Although, people are now starting that these handy desktops are bad for your well-being oposing that people strongly think that we dont get enough exercise or outdoor activitys in. Well computers are such a great entertainment system also, have a vast information supplie, and even allow socialization with friends/ family. I don't understand why they say this. So let me express my love for computers to you. Televisions, radios, and @NUM1 payers are no match for the internet and it's great wide spread entertainment system. The computer has all of the faimly fun movies, itunes tracks, and even websites where you could make your own movies. Posting pictures on the @CAPS1 and sending them via email only by a click of your mouse. The internet is the obvious best reason for a faimly movie night. One of the greatest pro about the internet is the vividsorce of information. Google, wikipedia, or even dictionary.com are the greatest information sites of the @DATE1. As much as nature watching and exercise is healthy and fun I would rather learn about a sunny beach of @CAPS2 or the great landscape of @LOCATION1. If your looking up how to tie a tie or even info about your history report the @CAPS3 is a sure easy thing. How could you talk to your friend who is across the world in @LOCATION2 or germany. The answer is simple, skype, fiacebook, myspace and more are all available on your handy @CAPS3. Many sites have a no fee polocy so they cant charge them money for social living with friends. As a personal experience I could now talk to my cousins wqho live in @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION1 due to the great interaction site of facebook. And why would you take the time to run across town to be unsure that thier even there. Obviously internet is a great socializing activity. Now that I have stated my opinion about the wonderful effect of the internet such as the entertainment system, information about the history of the world, and even the socializing with friends. I'm people will open thier eyes see the great uses of the computer.",5,5,1

Also people are getting information off of the computer which is a good thing for important paper that you might have to do or collage essay to get in to that collage. Another reason is that people are truning a bit lazy and not getting to enjoy exerising and getting to get some freish air. To more on I will explain what I mean about being with family and friends. For example let's say that your friends are planing on going to yhis huge beach party that every one is going to. So you tell your friends to pick you up but beofre they come you go on the computer talk to some you know and your friends come to your house to pick you up but you are not  for them they pass on by you don't go go to school next day there talking about you miss the party. SO that is any story , it might seen long so, I'm shorting the next part which is the information on computer. Foe example lets say that you  doing on  paper you  . Just need youre more . You find a place you go on find good write come down yet of of the computer finish paper get grade that is good feel happy the end. So that is the only good end of the reason why computres are good. For some  reason some people went to stay inside on the computer but other go outside on a good warm day. So what is your reason myspace, facebook other its good if you talk to other people bad if all you worried about if your pics are good, what matters is there you need to be haapy. I think  done all I could. So thoses are my reason why computer are good and bad  for reasch bad because of nooding to exericis and need to be with friends ",4,3,0

Oh, how much you want to just relax in the natural free air, but with all the advances in technology you feel it's your job to always be updated. I believe that advances in technology have had a negative affect on people. People aren't exercising interacting with family and friends in person, or having the ability to enjoy nature. Exercising means getting your hear to pound, your body to sweat and me because of endorprimes that ultimately make you feel better. @CAPS2 in front of a @CAPS3 all @CAPS1 does not support you with the natural urge to exercise.

Statistics show that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people say tennis have actually made them more confident. This is because when people are able to have the determination to lose weight and head healthier , they feel they can can over the world. Isn't this the attitude everyone needs? Nature is all over and helps us are even if @CAPS4 don't notice. Like trees, they take in @NUM4) and release oxygen. Oxygen is key to life. Trees also are home to many living organisms.

1669,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that the aspect of computers and their influence on people has been brought up. I personally feel that computers are a marvelous tool to help mankind advance. They provide infinite knowledge, entertainment, and dispite what the opposing side says, allow social interactions for those who don'@CAPS4 like to meet face to face. My first reason why computers benefit humans rather than hurt them is the knowledge they provide. Computers give access to the internet, which has near-infinitr amounte of knowledge stored inside @CAPS2. With a simple click of a button you have thousands of websites dedicated to answering your question. They can provide tons of information normally unobtainable. Take for example two students, one with a conputer are without. Both are given an assignment to write a report on a famous person. The one with the computer logs any searches for the reason, and in seconds has enough information to write numerous reports. He aces the reports, and continues to use this method. He graduates top of the class, goes through college and gets a high paying job right out of the gate. The one without the computer needs to go to the library. After spending an hour walking there, he learns that all the books on thet person are checkedout. He finds a book with a short bit on that person and writes about thet. He fails the test, fails the grade, drops out of school, and works ot a @ORGANIZATION1 his entire life. See how much of a different a computer can make? My second reason is that, even though computers are often thought of as destroying @CAPS2, @CAPS3 can build social lives. Millions of people use the internet everytime and there are places on the web built so that they can talk. Some people @MONTH1 that this is and leads to , but anyone who has basic knowledge knows not to information. The internet also has and those still unsure can use specially sites to talk to people they know in life onlt. @CAPS2 also allows for people to ask questions. Having differently finding specific information? Just post a question on a public site use people with first hand experience will answer @CAPS2 with all the detail you need and more. Say that somebody wants to be a writter, but needs to know how the writing system works, how to set a job in @CAPS2, what the pay is, etc. He searches the internet, but only finds job applications and college ady so he asks the questions on a public site. Someone who has been a write their whole lives checks out the question, and answers @CAPS2 ion great detail. Problem solvely and @CAPS2 someone on the internet. My final reason is the entertainment computer provide you can play games, watch movies or homemade videos, and even talk to friends. Computers allow you to access thousands of free services to benefit you. Sitting in your room, bored? Why not play a game on your computer. Tired of @CAPS4.V movies? Go to the computer and have an infinite wideo library? Go to the computer and have an infinite video library at your dipasle. Lonely? Go to a social website and strike up a conversation. @CAPS2 has infinite entertainment, right at your finger-tips. In conclusion, I believe that compkuters is no limit to what you can do with a computer, as long as you have the imagination. Computers were invented to benefit mankind, not hurting and they are doing a great job.",5,5,1
1648,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers have a positive effect on people. With a computer you could do so many things! They provide plenty of information, communication, and even entertainment. The only reason some find it to be unhealthy or negative is because some people abuse their ""computer-time"". Ever used the popular website ww.google.com? Sites like this, and many more, are great when you need information. Your practically just type in a word and automatically have hundreds or thousands of links, containing information on that word, to choose from! How could so much knowledge be named unhealthy, or have a negative effect on people? Computers have dictionaries, references, translators, encyclopedias, or even history pages that hold massive informatiion. So go ahead and expand your knowledge! If you log onto one of the most famous and well-used social networking websites, such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, you will find a new way to communicate with friends and family. Equipped with tools and various settings to keep you safe, you can find long-lost friends or out-of-touch family members and instantly catch up. Again, many people abuse those websites, putting up harmful words, inappropriate things, but that problem can be easily solved if you ""report' them to the website manager or to an adult. You just have to know how to be safe online, if not, the computer can be a very negative object for you. If you know how to use it right, you'll enjoy messages from family or instant messages from friends. There is a wide variety of entertainment on your computer. From video-sharing websites like www.youtube.com. to gaming websites like www.onemorelevel.com. These sites provide games and many videos, or even learning aids. There are sites where you can purchase music ang movies, or even clothes and furniature. Many stores have online websites wher you can purchase items and have them shipped to your front door. How could that possibly be regroup? Also, there are video games that are specially created for the computer, that you can buy, and have installed for isntant entetainment. I mean, who doesn't like to play games or shop, without having to go through the trouble of finding time to go out and do it? I know my aunts do. So you see, computers aren't negative, unless you abuse your ""computer-time"" and waste countless hours for no reason. You need to have a limit. Without it, it's just plain weird spending all day on a computer. So have fun! Learn, communicate, entertain youself.",6,5,1

1650,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 would a person do with out a computer? Well I think nothing because @CAPS1 if you are like me that have their family far away in another country well whith a computer you can see them throught a camara and talk to them just like if you where there. Computers just don't take your time they help you understand the menning of a family.These are many reasons why I think computers should be very important. My first reason is that they give you information about a place that you might be interested to see or know their culture. There are many people that like to explore and see new places, but they can't because maybe they just don't have time or they might have to much work. There is no exception for someone to not put their oportunities out, just because they don't have the time or a computer. My second reason is work. People like you that work in a office need information about a place that a disaster happened. You might need somenthing to see how it happen and @CAPS1 was the condition it happend. People that work in a important place need a computer because they are saving their work so they don't lose it and get fired. My third and last reason is to be organized. Being organized is very important it helps you keep a job or having everything on hand. Well computers are not just a pass of time it also makes your life easier. Many people say that they don't @CAPS1 to have to much papers; with a computer you can have all those paper in just one page that is saved by you, and only you can see it. As you @MONTH1 see many people that have computers use it in a productive way. It's not just a pass of time like people say it is. It also helps you do many stuff for your own future: not just to play around with some new friends. Well as you @MONTH1 see this are my three main reasons for keeping a computer in your house and using it in a good and productive way. ",4,4,0
999,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 your life without computers. Writing articles on a typewriter or by hand would surely be a hassle. The question of whether or not computers are beneficial to society has risen in the media, where they argue that people spend less time exercising interacting with nature, and less time with their family. However, computers are a great step forward in modern science and are beneficial to communities. Computers have drastically helped out educationally at school, not to mention the easier way of connecting with friends and family. Also computers have so many different forms of entertainment. Computers are great step forward and are completely beneficial to our society. Firstly, computers have helped academically in our schools and at home. I can't even @CAPS1 the hassle of coming home with thee assignment or writing two essays, only to have to write it by hand! Wanting to get it over with would only cause me to rush, resulting in a bad grade. Also, think of the handwriting factor. Most kids in my school don't have good handwriting, and I am assuming that teachers have a hard time grading something they can't read. With programs such as @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS2, you are given the option of different fonts, colors, bolding, pictures, symbols, and so on. Another way computers have helped academically is in schools. More and more teachers are using computers to help us learn. Tests are taken on computers, websites to help us research are visited, and other @ORGANIZATION1 program such as powerpoint can be used for a project. Computers help a lot in school, while helping us learn so much more. Computers also help with keeping in touch with friends and family. The days of short letters are replaced with long emails with pictures attached, sent in a matter of seconds whizzing through the internet only to arrive on your friend's screen. People can save money by not having pictures developed but instead having them stored on their computer, ready to print onto boand paper. There adveances in communication through computers that have been made. Things such as cideo chat (vchat) where you can literally see and talk to the other person, or just audio chat where you can talk to the person, have been made. Such easy ways of communication motivate people to speak to family and friends and stay in touch. Computers have made a positive impact on community by havinf simple ways to talk to your loved ones. Computers can alos provide a fun source of entertainment on the web. Websites have been created where you can play games, find people from your past, or maybe just look out funny videos. Anything you type into your toolbar instantly transforms into a page of links websites where you con find details on your topic, or relative things one fun website is that of 'youtube'. This website lets people upload videos. The possibility are endless on the web. Another fun website is '@CAPS3'. This website is where you can 'friend' people you know from the past and interact with them. You can post viedos, write messages and such. As you can see, entertainment is everywhere on the web. The time is now to understand the full benefits of computers. Computers are a benefit to modern day society because they help academically, encourage you to stay in touch with family and friend, and provide entertainment. We should all understand that computers are a huge advance in science, and they are a great help, and also fun! ",6,6,1
99,"Dear @CAPS1: Have you been sent a photo of a @NUM1 year old child with no clothes on? Well, if you have this is called sexting. It can be put on the computer or any type of device. People should stop using Computers more because it can lead to bad things like sexting from teens, bad for the younger kids, and teens could be, talking to someone they don't know.

625,"Wouldn't you agree that spending time on the computer takes away half of your life? Going on the computer can have a negative effect on you! Personally I think not going on the computer benefits you, @CAPS1's more time for your family, going outside, and staying healthy! Certainly going on the computer will mean less time for exercising. For example, lets say you went on the computer for an hour, that hour could have been used to go outside and stay fit! think about the choices here; you could either sit on a chair and play on the computer or take a nice run and burn a ton of calleries! Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of people that go on the computer instead of getting exercise, are in risk for health problems including obesity. As you can cleary see going on the computer really isnt the healthyiest choice to go. Most definatly going on a walk or enjoying nature is better than going on a computer.

If you just even look out your window to see this beautiful god created for us you would want to go out there and enjoy @CAPS1!

Without a doubt this world is gorgeous and @CAPS1 is worth while to see the nature! Everyone knows that family comes before everything! For example, you might love the computer but that love should not over power your time you spent with your family! One day on a @DATE1 night @PERSON2 was on the computer and her mother called saying, ""@PERSON2 @CAPS1's time for dinner"", @PERSON2 ignored her mom and chose to go on the computer! Now you really cannot give up time with your friends and family since they are so important! I know with my heart and saw that my family means the world to me and everyone shown more time for each family member, not the computer! Its now or never to decide if computers benefit society or not! With no computers you could have so much free time for your friends and family if you could only imagine! Most importantly @CAPS1 will not only benefit you but @CAPS1 will mean a lot to your family so what are you waiting for? Get off the computer and spend some qulity time with your family!",5,6,1

People need computers to get updated on important issues, contact others and learn new information. Computers are neccisary for everyday life. It's very important that news gets around, and one way for it to do that is by computers. Average people like me and you need to know the weather, global issues and many other important topics. If you use the computer to get updated on important issues you will be able to acess the information right away. For example there is no need to wait for the weather to come on the television when you can find out the weather for your local area withen seconds. Just recently there was an earthquake in @LOCATION1 and million of civilians died. if a natural disaster was to happen somewhere in @CAPS2 people would need to know and computers are a great way to make sure everyone is updated.

Computers are useful for adults as well. If adults want to learn something new all they have to to is search it on the computer.

Computers can find every answer to your questions. In conclusion, computer are really benefitting society.

168,"Dear @LOCATION1 Newspaper: @CAPS1 you really think computers are that good? Computers are so helpful today almost everyone has one. Computers are wonderful they are great ways to find information, they connect people from all over the world, and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 opportunities, hopefully at the end of this letter you will agree with me. Firstly, they help people find information. Computers are great ways to find information with google and other programs like it the whole world is at your fingertips. In my school surveys show @PERCENT1 of all students use the computer to help them research for school projects and asignments with computers you can view many diffrent websites from all around the world about a topic and you can even find online books that you can use, this is one way computers are a great thing out there are two other great reasons. Secondly, with computers the wole world becomes smaller as people begin to know more and more people through the computer. More than @PERCENT2 of people email, @CAPS2, or videochat on a daily baes. Isnt it great when you mnake a great friend in collage but you find out he/she lives halfway around the world, to know that you can still keep in touch with the computer, did you know that many people in the in the military use videochat to keep in touch with their loved one back home? Computers are great because they connect people and allow them to be together even when they cannot be together, but there is still one even better reason why computers are good. Finally, computers ofter many opportunities like education and jobs. Today there are many single parrents more than in any other time according to @ORGANIZATION1 and the number is still drastickly increasing with this economy some of those parrents could really use a better education to help them bring in more money for their familys, but when can they find time to go to school with work and then the kids? Now there are many online collage courses you can take to get the education you have always wanted with kraigslist and other online adds many people can post job ofering while others can email those people their resume to try to get the job, but by seeing adds posted online people can apply easier from farther away. Computers open many great oppertunities for people. Computers are very cool machines that many people take fergranted, they help give people information, as well as connect people from around the world and offer many @ORGANIZATION1 oppertunities. So @LOCATION1 Newspaper I hope you can try to understand my view on why computers are so great.",5,4,1
1001,"Dear Newspaper, I think people should use computers for spicific reasons. One reason is that many people lose family or to be more spicific lose contact with people. Then when you have a computer for someone else has one then you would be able to see them. For other purposes like wanting to play online with fellow student or friends then you have to use computers. Plus your fingers get a exercise when your typing. Many of us young kids say that myspace and facebook is a bad place. Actually its not because most of your family is on it. Doctors use computers all the time to notife other doctors that something wrong with a patient or give a visual of the bereathing. Workers even use it to see whats going on with the jobs if theres any jobs open so they can take it. Students use it to show what work they have to do when the teachers not there. If i was a capenter of a real estate agent I would have a computer with me. The reason why is that my group would know what houses are avalable to use or thats sold. Or I would give them different house to choose from and give them a good deal on it. I would also bring a computer with me for gps so i can know where I am. Many people use computers for different reason. Such as pog, cheatcodes, @CAPS1 cards and other thing. My reason for using this is because my work is important to me. I would do it on the computers if I miss it. That is why you should have computers all the time. You newer know what would happen. In conclusion, This is why computers are very important to have. The reasons are for if somthing happens. To you and you don't have a phone use a computer. Also its beneficial that everyone has thing to do but computers are the best thing to do.",4,4,0
759,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have heard the concern of many scientists about computers. Computers have brought us into the @DATE1 and have improved our society but they are harming our childrens health and education. Because of computers, children and adults around the world are spending less time with family and friends, they are not enjoying athletic activities and they are having health problems. Because of an increase in technology, children and adults are not spending time with their families. The computers are ruining family connections. For example, a study at @ORGANIZATION1 showed that families with more computers in their houses communicated less. The children are talking to their friends online or are going on social networking sites instead of talking in person to their family members. Also, computers are making it very hard for families to have meals together. When the children are on the computer, they do not want to leave. This obsetion with the technology is making it harder for families to grow moved and of were more succesful in school. The computers are children from a better education. Athletic activities are also suffering been so of @PERSON1, fresh air more children They will be on websites all day insted of being on a. Sports teams because of computers. The electricity that runs computers of this radiation. Being exposed to this could lead to brain damage or possible death. When my aunt bought a computer for the first time, she complained about massive headaches that kept returning. This was caused by the radiation emitted from the computer. Another health risk is obesity. When children sit in front of a computer for many hours, they have an increase in apetite. These children eat because they have nothing better to do. While on the computer, the users eat and will gain weight because of the loss of exercise. They could become obese and possibly get diabetes. Therefore, there is less communication in families, a loss of excersise, and health concerns caused by the computers. The consequences of misusing this technology are devastating and could be life thretening.

Some people feel that computers distract kids so they're never spending time with family.

What if your a little kid and your mom or did go on business trips faraway for a very long time? You would use a computer to talk to them wouldn't you? Not everyone in your is always around you and when someone is faraway a computer is the way to connect. Because of computers kids don't exercise. What if your exercise happened to be hiking?

Say your just a young kid and you're always located to see @LOCATION1 but you can never go there. What would you do? You would hop on a computer and check it out. You can explore any place you want with the click of a button. In school you learn about very historic people who have been dead for thousands of years.

First of all, you can get a better education learning from them, also, it is a great way to communicate with people. Finally, it even teacher hand-eye coordination that you could use in your everyday life. My first point is that you can get a better education using them. For example, the textbooks that we use in social studies at our school still refers to @LOCATION3 as the @LOCATION1. Computers are a great way to get up-to-date information about the world.

For example, when I see @CAPS1 older brother go on the computer he look much smarter on it. That @NUM2 out of @NUM3 member of @CAPS1 family learn thing from the computer. @CAPS1 second reason that it teach hand eye coordination.

1055,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, To many people it is so much fun but then they become so obsessed that they can lose so much that they loved. My stand is that computers hurt peoples. Money, weight and sleep. My opinion is my opinion but I will stand strong with what I have. My father is favorite is the financial deal. With five kids and one laptop who would want to be happy. With people sitting and staring at a computer game all day the bills just keep billing up until you lose everything, such as your house, family, money, ect. But who cares about them when you are obsessed with your computer. My favorite is the overweight problem. Yeah I agree it is nice to sit in a soft cushy chair with your computer and bowls of chips and boxes of pizza but sooner or later all that fatty food will catch up to you when you least expect it but will you get up and take a jog, run on a treadmill or go for a @NUM1 walk. Probably not will that computer game running. That wright will keep coming until you can't even move. Sitting at a @NUM2 will really have your eyes, brain, muscles and other important bodyparts due to lack of sleep and want for it. I can relate this to my brother with his dis. The be gets home, boom he is on it until maybe @NUM3 or @NUM4 o'clock in the @TIME1. Eventually he is going to get sick and I'm not to blame for it. When you sit at a computer than eventually you are going to make yourself sick and in some cases die if you were up that late. Now as a common teen to love to go on the computer but one thing I do not do is sit and watch movies or play games every hour of every day. I get outside and run so that I will not fall victim to weight. Financial, and body problems, like @MONTH1 people do.

309,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 all the talk about computers these days I would have to agree with the people who think its taking up alot more of our time. I hardly ever see people playing outside anymore because apparently computers are far more entertaining then being with your friends and family. Why do you think the obesity is so high these days? Well theres one of the reasons and I @CAPS5 when my parents were kids that they had no computers and they went outside to enjoy nature. Computers have there ups and downs but I do not think they benifit out society, first reason being, computers are taking away time to be with our friends and family. I rember when facebook and @CAPS6 werent created those were the days when people actually did fun things with there friends and family. there was a recent study that snowed since @DATE1 to @PERCENT1 of all americans use computers more than @NUM1 @CAPS2 a day for all sorts of diffrent reasons. I think mainiy computers were invented to make reason easier but now adays all we use them for is social networking. My second biggest point as to why computers do not benifit our is because over the past @NUM2 years the obesity rate has gone up by @PERCENT3 and due to what cause? eating un healthy food and sitting in front of your computers all day not exersiing. I am almost @PERCENT2 sure that if people stoped using computers that our world would be a healthier place. dont you feel bad for those people who are stuck being ovwrsized for there whole life because of these habits? I @CAPS5 most people would feel bad. My last reason is that we have this ahmazing planet that no one seems to enjoy anymore becaus they use up all there time on computers if only people got out every once and a while they would relize they have been wasting where time. there been a recent study that says @PERCENT4 of people are inside doing nothing all day! thats more than half!!

The internt is a never ending sorce of knolage and you can learn just about any thing that you need to know just by searching it on the computor.Another usefull thing the computor dose is the ability to talk to people useing eother @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 or that rooms you can meet new people or talk to a distant friend or relitive on the computor and you can even hook up a web camera and actuly see theam as they talk to you something a phone cannot do. Also the computor is a good souce of entertainment. You can play a number of games off the internet. You can even down load consal games onto your computor. Another thing you can do is watch full episodes of @CAPS3 shows and movies like if you wer fallewing a telivison selles and you missed an episode you can just go look it up. And a favorit of mine is youtube wether you watch random videos watch famous youtube stars on post videos of your own ther is always fun to be had. And finaly all the programs on the computer ther is an endless amont of programs you can have downloaded they can be for fun such as paint and flash or they can be important like worn or knot book every program tha computer offers is usefull and fun to use and you can use most of these programs to help you in the real. Now I have mentioned some of the many thing why you can never spend enuf time on the computer shure exersise and nator can be helth but you can do only of that stuff I just mentond by takeing a nator walk so wont you agree computors improve our life more then they are unhealthy.,4,4,0
1224,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 a world without computers. Where would we get all of our information from? Would we have to religh on television or magaziens, where information can be changed? Or how would we ever get any reports done for work or home work? I know many people who don't write neat, how will any one read it? Basically, computers effect our lives so much in a good way that it would be chaos with out them. Computers allow people to learn how to type which can improve all around skills such as hand eye coordination, they let us connect with places we are not familiar with and see family members, and they allow people to have an online education which can help with the economy. Computers effect us in a very good way and they change our every day lives, @CAPS2 children these days cannot type. A recent study done at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that @PERCENT1 of kids older than @NUM1 already know how to type on a keyboard. Computers have such a big effect on us with so many skills that people don't ignoledge enough. Because all of thoes kids know how to type, they can spell better too. I remember one time when I was in the middle of writing a report online. I got @NUM2 a word I didn't know and had always had trubble spelling it. So I took my time and typed it out one letter at a time, and it was correct! This example shows that computers can effect everyones lifes, even younger kids. The way that we get information from computers is just like the way our hands get information from our brain to move. For example, when babies learn how to walk the religh on their brains show them how it's done. This is just like how when there is a natural disaster, such as the earthquake in @LOCATION1 we religh on our computers to show us and tell us what is going on and how something like this could happen. Computers can effect us this way because there are many things we might never know about our world without them. Computers effect families everyday lives by giving them online educations. My @NUM3 year old cusin told me that she was happy her mom could go back to college from home because then they could spend time together. I know you might think that computers can make families get further apart but they actually bring them closer together. There is only one choice and that is that computers effect all of us in a good way. They can help us learn how to type, connect us with our world and bring families closer together. Without computers we wouldn't be the same as we are today.",4,5,0
1609,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 the years computers have gotten faster smaller smarter, these advances have led to mankind as we know it advancing, but the effects that come with @MONTH1 be non profitable to the youth of the computer world. Some common effects computers have on people, mostly children are, preventing kids to play outside, tbe active, computers prevent people from using their immagination they also are a waste of time. Everyday a child across america will use the same old exuse, ""no mom, im not on facebook, im doing my @CAPS4 report"", while infact they haven't even started it, or they hours ago are now goofing around on line, but ask your self. ""did this happen thirty years ago? no your parents who grew up then were thrilled to an outside when thire assignments were compleated. They could not wait to get on that flaming red bike t go play ball with joey. Kids these days are becoming less active t egar to play outside f people blame obbisity on genetics while it probbly should be blamed on computers, sucking children to them. Because kids never want to leave the side of their beloved computer to go outside they are using less + less of their immagination. parents tell storys of when they would watch the one new episode of their favorite show + what whole week the kids in the neighborhood would take roles + act it out. but do you see that every day in this generation not at all. No one that or imaginn any thing new about it with friends to make it more fun they only move onto the wii five minuets later to play a smashing ballons game. Computers just up all of your time the average kid will spend up to four hours on the computer just falling around with no purpose. Wasting the time they could be improving homework or walking the dog the time is not bring donated to a good source. it is not being effective most times. they say computers are the now generation but dose that mean that the now generation must be, lazy, unimmaginitive, and not care what their time is put towards. Most people will say no we are not but you offer a nine year old to play on the computer or, oh say go outside! You would be ignorant to think they would go out to play. People want to move forward but can we not make a compromise?",4,5,0
607,"Dear newspaper, I read an article in the newspaper that said how people on their computers is a benefit and could be a bad habit. I actually think itÂ’s a good idea about people being on their computers. I have a few reasons why this is a good thing. Whenever a student needs information on a certain topic, then they use the internet for help. Research is helpful because there could be a lot of sites on-line that could give you what you need. The topics typed into search engines will help find any information help to you. Whenever a teacher @MONTH1 need an assignment typed, you can type it on your computer and have it ready the next day. You can also find interesting pictures on what you're learning about. Sometimes the internet could have more information than a certain book you would look into. It would sometimes be a good idea not to search for something all night, or someones going to be mad at the electricity bill. Also, it would be good if you double check your information because it could be fake. Using the internet doesn't need to be for work only. People use computers to shop on-line, check times for movies, and talk with friends. People talking to friends on-line is good because they @MONTH1 not be able to talk however they want in school, and you @MONTH1 not get to see them on the weekends. Teens who talk on-line usually talk with their best friends. If one friend on a group of friends probablly in the same town as you, then they could talk by using their laptops they bring anywhere. Then you could probably hear about something that you (and your friends) have in common which @MONTH1 be coming somewhere that's by where you live. So being on the computer to talk with friends isn't so bad. Students who are young, usually get to learn to type. This could help them in the future if you need to type up an assignment for school, a job application, or college application. Learning to type is good because you also get to see which keys are where and wont need to look at them alot. Soon, you would be able to type a certain amount of words in a short amount of time. This @MONTH1 also be help with reading and understanding big words. In conclusion, I think, computers don't hace too much of an effect on people. As long as they'er not on there for more than two hours, then they're fine. Using the computer seems to have more advantages than disadvantages.",4,5,0
53,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, To begin, I understand that people don't like computers because they are over used. If the computers are so bad then they shouldn't be used, but how I see it is that they also bring more good than bad. These points to computer wellfare are they bring sourses, their is interaction between people, and computers are going to advance more over time. Even though these people think they are overused they still use them. So, even I use the computer a lot, but it could be used for good. First and foremost, these computers can get sources online that can't be found in books. Their are search engines that you can find your topics on. Then, when you find your source it has info that could have been skipped over. They can show the other side of they story that they didn't say in the book. your projects that you used to have to go to the library for you now can do from home, that itself is a step that you aren't considering. For instance if people are on a lot @PERCENT1 of the time is research. Furthermore, people can interact with friends over the computer. They can talk, send pictures, or play games. For example, i play xbox and I talk to my friends over that a lot of the time. Even a video game is fun as being with them, quoted from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 ""I have a computer not for friends, but for work"". This shows that even large important still use it for work. people say using a computer is like learning to ride a bike. My mom told me a story that she met my dad because he fixed her computer at her job. So, I am here with my parents because of a computer. None the less, the computers are at their begining and they will further improve. So people that are on have a reason for why they are on the computer. This advancement is going to advance again and again so there won't be a way to stop it thus, people will be on it only more and more so there is no chance of stopping the outbreak of computers. Then you will try to stop them with ""computers eat your brain"". We all know that is garbage. To conclude, I implore you not to try and change the habits of others. I @CAPS3 that if people want to use computer they can. I say this with the sources, the friends and the advanement.",4,4,0
378,"Dear local Newspaper, I have heard that there is a controversy over if computers benefit our society. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they have beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. If we were in a world without computers then our society would be completely lost. First off, one contributing factor is that computers help us keep in contact. Any one person can simply send an email by a click of a button. However, if this device was not around, we would have to use postal service or the telephone, both of which cost money. Why wouldn't you want a computer? What happens if a hurricane is abroad, and a family has no idea of its presence? All they need to do is check their email or the internet to realize what danger they are in. Calling somebody is risky because they could not be able to ansuer for any reason. In a situation like this, computers became essential to everyone. Clearly, the ability to contact is a great reason why computers need to be kept. Secondly, computers help us complete our daily work. Almost everyone works during the week, and if you @MONTH1 not realize it, we get most of our help from computers. Let's say that a man or women is ath theiroffice and they need to create a power point in order to share the companies new brand. All he/she needs to do is turn on their computer and begin to work with a blink of an eye. But without this device, what would they be able to do? How would they complete their work? The need for a @CAPS1, @CAPS2, or laptop is obviously great when you work. Lastly, computers give us the ability to play games and browse the internet freely. When I go home, usually I go straight to my computer like most teenagers do. I can easily check scores or last nights games, listen to music, and play solitaire by myself. I dont need to turn on the @CAPS3 and wait throve . All of these tiresome commercials. I don't need to grab a @CAPS4 and throw it into a boombox. I don't need to grab all the playing carols and set a game up. All I need is my computer. Without a doubl the fun and helpful computers such as games help us out. Although some say that computers aren't needed they help us throughout our lives. Based on my opinion, it has become clear to me that they are beneficial because they help us keep in contact, complete our daily work, and give everyone a fun time. All of these facts to one final solution, which is keeping computers in our society.",6,5,1
1298,"Dear @CAPS1, I have recently discovered that you are debating the computeres have on people. In my opinion I would think they have a neutral effect on people. In this day and age computers are used for many things. Research, communication act. maybe the reason young people so much time in the computure is because they have a lot of home work on the computer, ""@CAPS2 this"", ""@CAPS2 that"", people don't relize to pass we have to go on the computure. And for adults when you work with big companies you work with people all around the world. Instead of fixing to all these meetings you can simply do it over webcam. Yes, I see your concern that people spend too much time inside on their computure but what about people who love to read or play music, they could spend hours upon hours practicing or reading. What is the difference? And you never know maybe being on the computure for someone is lik a sport for another. Computoras are just about anywhere houses, schools and even crime & medical labs. Computure or a prime source of the data base, of @CAPS4, criminal records and so much more. With out computures how could catch the bad guy or catch the cancer before it's too late. Computure are key in many things. in the end you could go all day about the pros & cons of computures. But there so key in major aspects today, the pros out weigh the cons.",3,4,0
1598,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think the effects that computers have on people are bad, and should be stopped. I mean don't get me wrong computers help people, but a lot of people go on it everyday, some computers can get viruses, and there are much more activities to do other than on a computer. I hope to persuade you about the horrible effects a computer has on people. Do you know how many people use the computer? Well, according to @ORGANIZATION1 over @NUM1 billion people use a computer worldwide. The problem we are facing today is that too many people are on a computer, most of them are teens. According to @PERSON1 about @PERCENT1 of teens spend most of their time on an computer. Facebook, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 are the most common places to find teens. I would know that because I have a facebook myself. I've had one for almost a year, and you should see all the people who have one. My friend wanted me to get one because she said she had one one wanted me to get one too. So I did and then I found out that more then half of my grade had a facebook. In my own words I honestly think the computer can be addicting, especially when your on a worldwide account like facebook. There are many people on the computer and if must be stopped. In addition, another reason is computers occasionally get viruses. According to @CAPS3.com, the average adult gets about @NUM2 to @NUM3 viruses a year. My friend @PERSON2 was on his computer typing a report, and then his computer shut down. Then @NUM4 seconds @CAPS4 the computer said you have a virus. The next day @PERSON2 told me he didn't have his report because the virus wiped out all his information. About @PERCENT2 of viruses can cause a computer to shut down and it is hard to reboot it. Some places have made virus scans such as mcafee. and @CAPS5, but sometimes they can't catch the virus. @PERCENT3 of people who say that a virus was cought by the virus scan they have, their computer freezes up and you can't delete the virus, viruses must be terminated, so the computer can work properly. Thats another reason to why computers affect people in a bad way. Furthermore, people think that the computer is their everything. They're wrong! There is a lot of activities that they can do other than be on a computer. According to @CAPS6. Burn the average person between the ages of @NUM5 and @NUM6 spend more then @NUM7 hours on a computer. There are many other options of activities like call your friends and get together, that's why they invented the cell phone, play a sport, read a book, spend time with family for @PERSON3's @CAPS7! Don't spend all your time on the computer. About @PERCENT4 of teens who are on the computer alot tend to get into lower colleges later in life. That is my final reason of the bad effects a computer has. In conclusion, computers can cause a bad influence due to viruses, too much time on it, and not doing other things. I hope you can see my point to this and please send me a response as soon as possible.",5,5,1
30,"Dear Newspaper People, I think that computers do benefit society for a few reasons. Computers make work easier they can do things people can't like solve difficult problems, and kids like playing games on them. Computers make work easier and neater. Typing is often faster than writing, and is always easier to read. Studies have also shown that people who use computers to do work finish faster and have up to @PERCENT1 more free time to do whatever they want. Computers also have e-mail, which allows you to send work that you have done to your boss without printing it and wasting paper. Computers can solve difficult problems that people either can't do, or don't want to waste their time doing. If you need to solve a math problem you use a calculated or a computer. So you don't have to figure it out yourself. I have to do a lot of math problems for homework and I think it is much easier to use a calculator. My last reason why computers are good is that kids like playing games on them. A lot of people say that kids shouldn't play computer games but some of them are educational. Even non-educational games help kids to have fun and have something to look forward to after their work is done. @PERCENT2 of kids say that they are happier when they have something fun to look forward to, and happier kids do better work. I hope that after reading this you will understand how much computers contribute to society.",4,4,0
1341,"Today, wherever you go, there is technology being used. The most common, computers are widely used by a majority of people, but are computers really beneficial to society? Computers are beneficial to society because it is a way to connect with the world, a way to increase responsibility, and helpful for education. Computers are beneficial because they help people connect with the world. You can use a computer to find anything that is on the web, so you can find information about places that interest you or places that you would like to visit. According to the @ORGANIZATION1, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people check the internet for places to @ORGANIZATION1 to before they actually go. @CAPS1, it is a way to connect with faraway friends. One of my friends moved to @LOCATION1 when we were in @NUM3 grade, but we still e-mail each other, and are still friends. The computer is @CAPS1 one of the fastest ways you can learn about current events. All you have to do is go to a news website. All of these connections will widen people's views of the world. Computers are a way to increase responsibility, too. When the people use the computer, there are many choices that they have to make, like what websites to go to and what to download or watch. Having these individual chances will help people think of what the right choice is. Even if you choose the wrong choice, you will learn from your mistake. Second, the computer is a very fragile machine and it takes a lot of to handle. For example, you can't have any liquid nearby and must not throw objects near or on the computer. Thinking of this and making sure not to damage the computer are ways to increase responsibility. Lastly, computers are beneficial because they help education. Teachers can use the computer to make lessons more interesting. For example, they can create points and presentation to providea @CAPS1, students can on what they learned at school. @CAPS1, you can make for the students, which provide them with their homework and information about the classes one of my friends once said ""@CAPS2 the I would definitely be failing"". Nobody wants to talk and a great way to present this. Lastly, if you want information on a particular school, you can just search it online and find its website. School websites have information about classes, events, and clubs. They provide the information that you need to think about going to that school in an easy, convenient way, while finding the website for the school take no more than @NUM2 minutes, actually going to that school for information can take more than just @NUM2 minutes, and even hours. According to @ORGANIZATION2, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students choose what college to go to first by checking its website. The computer is an easy, convenient way to get information. Now, no one should be doubting the benefits of a computer. They are a connection to the world, like places, and people. They increase responsibility by giving you many choices. They help education by providing information about and for schools. This is why computers are beneficial to the society.",5,5,1

There are good reasons of thinking such a thought that is in this time with such an eviormetal breakdwon we need to get close to nature while it's still here. Next today our interaction is very low when if your talking about actuall talking to the person and because of computers it makes @CAPS3 all the more lazy while sitting around doing nothing. Lastly the @CAPS2 is harmful and expensive not to menshon the fact that the enviorment is already falling apart. The way natures heading we will all end up dieing no thanks to computers.

So be one of the @NUM1 out of @NUM2 that instead of staing iside views the great things the earth has to offer.

Lastly, computer make the world a much more and fun place thanks to youtube, news and online movies/tv shows. The effect of computers is definetly positive on society. With one click a message can be rent to anywhere in the world. How great is that? Because of computers people not only email to each othe but we can even have live chat. through text or videos online communication is a great help i my life, and the lives of my peers. For example, whenever I forget homework or have about schoolworks I can reach my peers and get help in a matter of. Not only can I seek help from others on my computer but I can stay in touch with my friends and family. So those who think computers cause us to spend less time wioth family and friends are mistaken.

1782,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that computers are a good source of technology. The reasons which I am fighting for tell why, kids are in school more than half of the school day. Parents should be limiting there childrens use and what they do, and computers are a way of contact and research. To begin, kids are in school more than have of a school day. How could children stay on the computer when there in school learning? They can't. In school you get alot of exercise because your always movign around. After school kids usually do homework or go out with friends. Computers don't have effect on people, if anything it makes them smarter. Secondly, if children have a computer at home their parents should be limiting the time and what exactly they could do on the computer. The people who support advances in technology are correct, computers open up imagination, and learning. Parents of the children that have computers should be more worried than anyone else and if they are , they should just take the computer away. Parents sould also take their kids places more often so the schild win not have to go online. Lastly, computers are a way of contacting others. If you don't have a phone, you use a computer to go on your email, or personal websites. Also poeple need computers for schol work and for their jobs too! Another thing numerous peopel use a computer for is research and reports. We need our information! To conclude, my thoughts are very important to consider because, mny other people would be shy to wirte this and get it published in their local newpaper! I would like to say computers are not interacting with family, friends, nature or anything of that sort. We as a whole need computers to do daily life things, without be able to go online, or save files we would be lost! So I will say again to consider my ideas. Thank you.",4,4,0
1031,"Dear @CAPS1, I beleave that computers have a good and a bad effect on people. Even though I think it has both effects on peope, I think that it has a better effect I think this because the internet gives people the chance to learn more about other places. Allows people to talk to family that lives far away, and it also helps to make new friends. I support the advances of technology. I support it because people can talk to their family that they can't get to see. I have three cousins that live in @LOCATION1 that I never get to see, but with computers I can talk to them all the time. We can email and @CAPS2 to chat to eachother to find out what they've been doing, hows school, and so much more. My aunty loves to send and get pictures from them to see how much they've changed since the last time we saw them. Without the new technology we wouldn't be able to do that. Computers also help learn about other countries and the people that live there. With the internet you can find what the country looks like, what types of food they eat, what type of language they speek, and so much more. Recently I had to do a project in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 about a place in @LOCATION2. I got @LOCATION4, @LOCATION3 with the help of computers I found out so much more about the country that I never even know about. There were so many great places to visit and learn about the history of @LOCATION4. Learning so much about the place makes me want to visit there someday. Without computers I never would have learned so much about that place. Another great thing about the new technology is that we can make new friends and talk to different types of people from all over the world. I read recently in the @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that atleast @PERCENT1 of kids have a myspace or facebook that helps them interact with people from all over the world. There can also be dangers to talking to people you've never met before. To be safe don't tell people your phone number or where you live. But meeting new people can also be good. For example, my cousin doesn't get along very well with the people she goes to school with. But after school she goes on her computer and talks to people that are just like her. Either way she should be careful. In conclusion, I must say once again that I support the advances of technology to an extent. Computers help you talk to family that you don't see, helps you learn about new countries, and meet new people. Thank you for your time.",5,4,1
846,"Dear local newspaper, I have heard about this issue concerning people are on their computer to much. In my opinion, i think that people should not spend so much time on the computer for several reasons. There are the reasons to why I think that people should less time on the internet, and more outdoors. One reason to why I think that people should spend less time on the computer and more times outdoors is so that they can get more exercise. When you get exercise you can lose weight. You can also feel lighter and better about yourself, you will be more active. Another reason to why you should spend more time outdoors than on the computer is because if you don't you will get very very very lazy. If you don't get out and play or exercise, you will become tired. Also, you will become cranky and want do what your parents tell you to do because your mind will be so into your computer screen. My last but not least reason to why we should spend more time outdoors than indoors on the computer is because we can miss out on family fun that goes on. Since people are on the computer so much they miss out an parties and social events. They @MONTH1 also miss out on family dinners and movie night. If you do not want to miss out on the fun, I suggest that you get cuclasses more and stop being a lazy couch potato. As you cansee, there are many reasons to why we should spend more time outdoors doing activities such as going on a bike side, going kout to eat, as even a nice stroll along the heart while walking the dog. I really hope that my opinions means something to you. And I also hope you agree with me. Thank you for your time.",4,4,0
584,"Dear newspaper, I disagree with you about computers. I think that computers are helpful with projects, homework, or letters. For example you can use a computer to help you with projects, if you have a project to do and you don't feel like going to the library, you can use a compater to look up information on just about anything. And you don't have to draw pictures, that's what printers are for. Also when you have homework most kids or teenagers, even adults don't like doing homework, thats what a computer do for you can just look up the anser online and then your done in no time. Let's say you have to write a essay I know nobody likes to write essay's by hand you can type @CAPS1 and design @CAPS1 with your own designs and make @CAPS1 look nicer than you writing @CAPS1. Further more I know nobody likes to keep up with and if you lose @CAPS1 then you have to start over and that takes forever to do especially if @CAPS1's due the next day, you get bored and you don't feel like writing @CAPS1 over and you get mad because you already did @CAPS1. And when you had @CAPS1 in you mysteriously find you other paper that you finished and lost and @CAPS1 makes you so angry. And then you have to worry about if someone store @CAPS1 and copied @CAPS1 and put their name on the copied one but changed some of your ideas around so that they wouldn't lose major points and grade drops from a @CAPS2 to a @CAPS3 in no time flat. Lastly you can use a computer write finds of letters. You can write a that and people's report card's if your a teacher, and you can also write a letter to friend that mights have moved away. Therefore the types of letters you should be writing are love letters to yor wife or girlfriend at work or in school and @CAPS1 fast too instead of writing @CAPS1 and then you hards start to the worst kind of way. So instead you can write @CAPS1 fast and they get @CAPS1 fast if they have computer but if they work at a school then they can get because every school should have a computer so they'll be able to get @CAPS1. Another kind of letter you can write is a letter to your friend that you haven't seen in years or that has moved to another country or to another state so I hope now I have convinced you about why @CAPS1 is @CAPS4 to have a computer but as you sad @CAPS1 itsn't always @CAPS4 to be on the computer @NUM1 but once in a while @CAPS1 okay especially in an emergency if someone has just died in your family and you don't know how to get there use a gas, and if you don't have a gas go online and print out the directions so that you can get their and see which family member died and if you knew that so now that you know the importance of a computer. I hope you use @CAPS1 wisey.",4,5,0
145,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1 are you adminitrating your loacl newapaper to society? You are probably using a computer to type the documents. If the government, businesses, schools, students and local newspaper are using computers for a variety of different tasks then @CAPS1 are thet not helpful? Primarily, computers are used for typing, editing and presenting as stated before, local newpaper are required to use computers to present their work. As a member of society, I knew I would not want to read something not typed anyway. The govermnet must announce laws to the people and use typed documents to communicate with different countries & states. Without computers signs, flyers, bussinesses, and even newspapers would not be possible. You are running late to work able to traffic on the hignway. @CAPS1 are you supposed to explain to your boss in time? You can simply email him the situation and arrive stress-free to work. Prctically the entire world uses computers as a source of communication, so why be indifferent? Computers make life easier for people through communication like email, social network websites such as facebook and aol, and even video chat. Computers supply an excellent source of communication that is even used throughout schools. Teachers and administrater interact with each other with important message using computers. if computers are important to them, the @CAPS1 could they be destructive to society? As a western middle school students, I know the amount of projects and research we are required to do per class. Without the internet this would almost be impossible. The internet allows research to happen. After reseach is finished, the paper or homework assignment must be typed and printed. Without the assitance from computers, ahving naetly-written and well-researched assignments would not be possible. To conclusion, I feel that computers are an excellent advance in technology and should be used as frequently as possiblr. Without them, newspaper could not print, teachers could not communiacte, and students couldn't complete tasks for school. As a student I know they help me with school and communicating with my friends and relatives. If computer are such a helpful source to society, why would people consider them as a concern?",5,5,1
1735,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, The issue before us is that people are addicted to computer. S I think we are not. In addition to all this some people can task and many things like hang out with there family and friend but most importantly enjoy life. In a way computer privliges can be as like your enjoying life. Say if you an your friend has the same computer which includes webcam, video messaging and more. That's life well what im trying to say is that yall can talk see each other, have private conversations. Computer's dont alway take you away from the important people or things in life. Some computers can help you, you can take school, learn how to write essays, learn how to read, and much more. Computers can be a success to some people. Only thing that can take you away from having fun with your family and friends is yourself you cant blame it on a computer. Imagine life without a computer what would you do? How can you survive? For example if you were giving some homework that you had to do on the computer and theres was no way for you to do that project in school. How would you do it? Some people need computers. I think if they thought and knew we was going to get so excited about how cool our computers' are they shouldnt so much new technologies in our life. Now you can probably see why I think we need computer and how it can sometime benefit our society.",4,3,0

Computers can also, @CAPS1 people slugish bor lazy. i feel this way because, to many people sit infront of computer instead of getting up & being active. Being acive gad and important for people. A lot of people are not active because they on the computer harms on end. Students sometimes go home and strayht oor tug computer instead of doing homework. Moreover, computers can help you pay bills. Do research, or maybe just for fun play games. There is an ulimeted number of websites & to cp on through to hep you with many of needs.

982,"In my opinion, I do believe that computers are good for you. I agree so because one, it can help you to communicate with other family members around the world. Two, it can teach you new languages you really desired to learn, and three, it can keep you updated on whats happening around the world. First, i believe that computers are good for you because it can let you communicate with your long-lost relatives you hardly see anymore. For example, if you miss any of your family members, you can simply go to your computer and search them up so you can type to them or talk to them through via chat mode, then you won't ever have that missing feeling anymore since you have a computer. In addition, computers can teach you how to learn new languages you alway's wanted to know, like, @CAPS1, or @CAPS2, or even @CAPS3 if you wanted! You can just simply go to your computer and type in ""language of @CAPS2"", and listen what it tells you of @CAPS2! Moreover, computers can keep you updated on whats happening around the world! It is way better to see it on computers than on tv's bevause computers give you more information about the situation of the event! Likewise, you could click, ""locate area"", on the computer and see in which area the incident took place in. You could also see the video's, behold the images, and seek the location of it on the computer. Sadly, my lecture has come to an . Those were my three main reasons why computers are good for people: You can communicate with long-lost relatives of yours, you can learn new languages, and therefore be updated on the qhats happening around the world. Would'nt you wan't to uphold those amazing events also?",4,4,0
855,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have both negative and positive affects on people. Many people before us went through everyday life without them. Although there are many good affects that computers have on people, the negative affect's outnumber them by far. For example, generations have lived and died without computers and it didn't affect them. Not only that but many children and adults in this centry are obese due to growing technology. Many people become obese because they were born with this technology and after years, or even days of sitting in front of their computer, they become lazy. They look to a computer as necesity and not a form of entertainment. Even though computers keep people in contact and keep them updated in their lives, that is the only important reason for a computer. As a student, I use my computer for my schoolwork. Everything I do on my computer involves either typing a paper or printing research. I could do these things with paper and pencil and ask people what I'm trying to find out. This is important because it shows that people don't need to be defandent on computers when they can do everything they need to without them. Lastly, computers aren't needed when we have the availability of cell phones that keep everyone in contact without computer games, chats or profiles. Also phones are safe so they cant get viruses and strangers cant look at your personal information, finding out where you live. In conclusion computers aren't healthy, keep you sitting, without exercise and aren't nessasary.",4,4,0
935,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, Are computers really as great as they seem? It seems to me that they are used way too much in people's lives, and that computers are distractions that don't allow people to di ceratin things in their life that they would if they weren't always on the computer. People's lives are starting to revolve around going on the computer, checking your facebook, and looking at new videos on @CAPS2.com. I know from experience facebook or myspace can be very addicting. I'll spend hours commenting on pictures or new wall posts, and then at @NUM1 pm I've realized I haven't begun any of my loads of homework. This happens quite often, and I end up staying awake until around @NUM2. The following moring I wake up at @NUM3 am, exhausted. I am not exaggerating either, this happens to many of my friends, and if you have kids, ask them because I am @PERCENT1 sure they are on facebook or @CAPS3 all night. This doesn't just happen with kids either, my mom just got a facebook and she is hooked to it, even more than I am. Sometimes it can be come a competition to see who has the most pictures, or the most friends. Kids start adding people as friends that they don't even know computers aren't just distractions, they are also very dangerous. At my school we had assembly where they showed us how easy it was to find out someone's personal information, Even if you don't have your address or your phone number listed, there are many other ways to track you down. If you take a picture right after you won the championship soccer game, in your jersey. Just that one picture shows your team name, your last name, and your number. Anyone could easily search all that stuff on the internet and know exactly where your next game be. As the local newspaper @CAPS1, I am sure you must be concerned about the safety of the town, or even your own kids. Some people @MONTH1 say ""that would never happen to me"" but it easily could, especially if you're constantly on your computer. I have noticed that a lot of teens around my age are starting to become obsessed with being on the computer. A lot of times in families, instead of spending time together. syblings are fighting over who gets to go on the computer. One sybling @MONTH1 need it for homework, while the other just wants to talk to her friends on @CAPS3 and each believes they deserves the computer. Computers are starting to interest a lot with people's lives, in a negative way. Once again they are distracting, dangerous and hurt families. Computers hurt society more than it helps. And maybe you should look into how much time your kids are spending on the computer. ",4,5,0
670,"Some people believe that computers are a positive effect to people, but its positive because it rots you brain. I think that computer is a waste of time and is an excuse for you to not spend time with you family as to go outside and enjoy nature. This is why computer time should be reduced and family time increased. Absolutley, computers is the type of things that can kill brain cells if you spend to much time on it. Teenagers are the main cause of this and when they get on the computer and get on myspace and facebook they wont be learning anything and just kill major brain cells. When they go to school to take the cmts they are going to fail because they wont know anything because of the computer. Also, This is a big problem for familys because they dont hang out with each other because their always on the computer. The excuse for parents is ""@CAPS1 im on the computer"" then they never go and the children get very upset. This leads to anger problems then they stop listening to you. All it is, is cause and effect. My friends on @NUM1 has anger problems and doesn't listen to anyone all because her family never hung. Consequently, peope spend most of their time inside on the computer, you guessed right! my sister is on the computer @NUM2 and she never goes outside to enjoy the nature. People can get that @LOCATION1 were they haute to go outside and we dont want that do eve. Doctor @CAPS2 brown says everyone should go outside to just relax mostly everyday because staying in the house is not good. The computer is defeating that purpose. On the other hand, the computer is a nifty device and can be very handy at times like if your need perfect directions or need a question answered. Sometimes you just want to talk to old time friends you haven't seen in a while. Computers are good for alot of things but to much of it is not good for us lastly, i'd like to say the computer has great purpose but i think it just makes excuses for us so we dont spend time with our family, dont go outside enough to enjoy the nature.",4,4,0
796,"Isn't it great getting a refreshing when your outside? Wouldn't you experiences the rush of jumping into the crashing waves of the @LOCATION1 instead of sitting inside, gazing at pictures of the @LOCATION1? You might think that computers are helping society today, but you are wrong. The human race has survived over hundreds of years without computers and we can survive hundreds more. Computers are helping society become more and more lazy. We can get just as much information out of books if we try our best. Hand-eye coordination is important, and we can get it though activities, such as football, and tennis. We can also get it from activities! Drawing, reading, and even playing an instrument can all improve hand-eye coordination while letting you explore your creative side. Some people believe that computers teach hand-eye coordination, and it can but there are better ways to get it. It would take longer to get it from a computer than an activity. Many people like to travel in all different places of the world, but going to a foreign area with no knowledge don't smart at all. So what do you do? Go the most convinient source, internet. But what if I told you that any person could put anything on the internet? You could be getting info on @LOCATION3 when you think you're getting info on @LOCATION2. The most reliable source would be from a book. Reading is very powerful, especially if you're reading from a good source. Kids lately have been making lives on the internet. The only way they communicate is through online chat. Chatting online can/should never replace time in person with friends. Relationships with others online is never real. We're using our knowledge of how to communicate with others. The internet isn't worth it. So as you can see computers are no good. Thank you.",4,4,0
969,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing this letter to inform you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I don't agree I think the experts are correct that people are spending too much time on their computer. My following reasons will explain why I don't agree. I think there is also an issue with computers. Please read on to understand my reasons. First of all, my reason on not agreeing with those who support technology is because their is no saftey! I think chatting online is great but dangerous. For example, most kids are followed by and its usually online. This is because the information all to unknown people. Also, kids get into dangerous for example they get kidnapped for this informal and the people they talk to. Secondly, I don't agree because it also caused addiction to the computers. Most people get addicted for the certain things they do online. These life of can also become dangerous. For example, people play some video games wich people killing and commiting crime. We cant not do in the ""real' world. These kind of game also bring people to dangerous. Another example is we've had students bringing because violence is the answer when it ! The addiction to computer is so bad that people do have a look of and interacting with things. Lastly, I dont agree because its also. Most people who are and again.

466,"Computers have a good effect on people because they can teach people hand eye coordinating events in history and about other cultures and they are a great way to relax and just have fun. Computers teach hand eye coordinator by training your hand to go where your brain tells it to and where your eyes show it. Hand eye coordination is very important. It can help people drives it decreases reaction time and it can help people write more neatly. If it can help a driver turn his wheel faster or hit his break I think that hand eye coordination could help that driver stay out of an accident. Think of a climber trying to grab a on a mountain. He would be able to see it, grab it, and himself up quicker than before. Most people don't know things like how many soldiers were on @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or how many countries there are in the world. The internet is a great place to find out about history world other things you wan't to know A lot of americans don't know @LOCATION2 history alone world history.

You can also learn either interesting and useful things like food recipes the contents in paints. Or you could just be keeping up with the need on yahoo.com. Computers are a lot of fun. You can talk with friends, listen to music, play games or do all three at the same time. That's just scratching the you miss your favorite show @TIME1? There are hundreds of websites that will let you watch it for free. Did you want to hear your favorite bands new album?

For example computers. Computers have to technology to go online and chat with various people all around the world. Thas when I get worried. In this essay I will explain why it is bad to spent too much time on computers. it is bad because people don't execisi enjoy mothers nature, and interact with family and friends. Firstly, people are for geting how important it is to excaise. It is very important because it keeps you fit and healthy. With the computers in use people become less fit and healthy. They start getting fat theire carasaprel get high and they stress more. Secondly they don't enjoy mothersnature. When people start going on the computers they stop doing a lot of things. Like stop going outside and getting fresh air. They get c losed in a small bubble and all they case about is the computers. They don't go out to camp, play outside; they don't do nothing. Every day they are on the computer. Finaly, one big main problem is: they stop inter acting with family and friends. When mothers and fathers are oh it they don't pay attention to these young ones and they are always on it. When teenagers are on the computers they don't talk to these parents, they ignore there friends and the people that care about them most. They wont care for everybody, but them selfes @CAPS2 there you have it; that is why I think we should cut down on the computer usage. For these following reasons: People stop exercising and being fit. They stop enjoiying mother nature, and they stop @NUM1 with family and friends. @CAPS2 what do yoo think?",4,4,0
1102,"Dear local newspaper, I think that the computer is not a bad thing becase of three resons one reson is that we can learn a bought a faraway place. Another reson is they teach hand-eye coordination. The last reson is we can talk to frteinds and meet new people. From the computer we can learn a bought a faraway place if we were doing a report on it or just our of curiosity. We can learn wat kind of plantation grow there for food for example tropical places grow bananas and cocanuts. We can learn wat they eat like in @LOCATION1 they eat many beans a lot of there food have beans even there salads. We can find out there language as well maybe they talk spanish like in @LOCATION2. You can also teach hand-eye coordination becase it involves using your fingers and eyes to see what you are typing. You use ur hands on evry thing while typing wether you are typing or you are using the mouse. But it is not just for learning things it is also for freinds becase of al these sites like myspace, facebook, aim, webchat. The posibilities are endless u can even play games. If you dont know someone on face, book, or myspace thats okay it is a great way to meet new people and new freinds. And another thing if u are having trouble findin freind you can just see if they are online. It is good for getting together somwhere or something. And for those pepole who think it is taking away family time you can always just say okay thats enough and talk to them.

My reasons for wrint this is because computers allow people to talk online to others people learn about faraway places, and finally it teacher hand-eye coordination. As you read my letter I hope you fell the same way. First of all computers allow you to talk to other people online. The reason I feel this way is what if you can't fond your fone in your hose or even your cell phone, you could see if they were online. Also its the same thing as texting, but with a bigger keyboard/screen I can relate to this because I was texting someone and went online to find whtm on too, so we sent aims to each other instead. I hope you can see why computers can be good for people. Secondly not a lot of people will go to the library to look up information for a paper for a school. The reason I feel this way is a computer has google to make finding things easier. Another reason is going to the library @MONTH1 cause you send more money to fill up your gas tanks. I can relate this because everytim my family goes to the library we have to fill the car up after we go. This is another reasons why computers a good. Finally the computers can teach hand-eye coordination. The reason for this is because if your writing an email then you should know the keys that your fingers touch. Another reasons why computers are hand-eye coordination is because if your kid take karayta then might have learned to move there hands that fast from somewhere. I can relate ti this because when I was in the first grade there was a guy that you told me and my friends that be need us to get in the truck to help him find his lost puppy, and he tried grabbing me but I pulled my hard away before I became pinned. I hope you can see why we need computers. I would like to that the I for sitting and reading my essay.

My first reason is that some people at college are far away from home like my sister and my family talks to her through the computer. Also many people have an email! that tells them about sales at grocery stores or clothing stors and it saves people money using those cupons. Statistics state that grownups that use the computer at night feel more awake in the @TIME1. My second reason is that if someone is going on vacation or they are moving they can go on the internet and find out if where there going is safe or if they have a nice school there and they can learn about the place and see what it looks like. they can also find out about colleges and see how nice they are see if its a small school if there are alot of kids that go to that school and etc. My third and final reason is that when people use the computer there. hand eye coordination gets better because when your typing your moving your fingers and your geting the feeling when you use it and your geting faster at typing. Also your not just siting there your moving your fingers and your using your brain. Scholastic kids states that kids who use the the computer and use the keyboark brings there @CAPS1 up @NUM1 points. in conclusion I dont think that the computer has a bad effect after your done reading thise I hope you agree with me.",4,4,0

Changed our way of life and have made things easier. I am a firm beliver that computer were one of the greatest invention of all time. Computers have had a very vital and positive impact on society. For example, education has vastly expanded since the computer. Both teachers and students have benefited. Students can now search the intrenet and learn about different places, things in history, how to read and write bette, etc. Also computers have been a major part in entertainment. From reading online news to watching movies and listening to music computers entertain all of us. And computers help us connect with friends and even meet new people. Aside from that computers make life easier. People can get degrees from learning online learn another. Research as also easier than is to computers you can just about anything than to computers. Some people say computers stop people acting with family but infact facebook you can still. Computer have also ourlives. From helping small buiness thrive by making it easier to make and recieve orders to help spread information globaly computers make this all possible.

1166,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are helpful once in a while but @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people believe that they are a waste of electricity. Computers aren't beneficial to everyday life overall. When people are on the computer they spend multiple hours on it. This means that they aren't getting enough exercise and that they are harming them bodies. Not only this but people have a tendency to use this machine obsessivly. They spend more attention on the computer and not enough time with your family. Every one knows exercise is important. However, what happens when we don't get enough? Heart disease is the number one cause of death in the @LOCATION1. Heart disease is caused by obesity. That's what happens when you don't exercise. When you are on the computer you are sitting down rather than moving around. This means that your motabolism isn't going and you burn less calories. That is not healthy for anyone. Even people in perfect condition. Gaining weight isn't the only way you can potentially harm your body. When using the computer you have to look at the screen which is with very bright @CAPS3 lights. After looking at the screen for so long your eyes will begin to feel the affects of the lights. Many people say its like staring into a flashlight for an extended amount of time. About @PERCENT1 of the kids at our school wear glasses because of using the computer for to long. That @PERCENT1 is @PERCENT2 more than we had before. We used to have about @NUM3. Like I said before, when you use the computer you use it for an extended amount of time. What about family? They deserve more attention than a machine. To spend more time on the computer than your own flesh and blood isn't right. In a survey an average of @NUM4 out of @NUM5 people said that the spent about eight hours on the computer between work and home, and about an hour with family. The results were more than shocking with all of this in mind, ask your self how useful the computer really is. Sure it's good at researching things quickly but its also good at making people gain weight, making people spend money on glassses and tearing them away from their family members. At the end of the day, the computer isn't very helpful at all.",4,5,0
573,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 has been a debate on whether modern computer activities are good for people or bad for the people. Some people think that it benefits society because computers can teach hand eye coordination, they can help people learn about faraway places, and allow people to interact with friends. Al of this seems to prove that computers are good for society, but truely it is not. People who use their computers too much can have some harmed side effects, including obesity, red eyes, and even can get cyber bullied. People are using computers to an extent to which it is bad for their health. The number one problem of the @LOCATION1 is obesity. It seems that people are getting fatter every day. Computers are definetly taking part in the problem. People are spending too much time on their computers and are spending less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. These people are spending hours and hours in front of a computer getting heavier every day. They start to eat their feelings because of how lonely they are. This process continues until the certain person can barely yet out of their chair. Obesity is not the only problem that is damaging their health, their eyes are being damaged also. It is obvious that more & more people are having problems with @CAPS2 eyes everyday. Computers are making this happen. When a certain person is on the computer for only an hour, they are damaging their eyes tremendously. The computer screen is straining their eyes horribly & for the people who are on the computer @NUM1 - @DATE1 hours a day are pretty much sending their eyes to blindness. When I go onto the computer for only @NUM2 minutes my eyes start to water. It is a devastating outcome of using a computer too much. Computers are damaging peoples health & @CAPS2 should be something done about it. Although computers aren't only damaging people health they are also ruining peoples lives. Bullying has been a major problem in the @LOCATION1 for many years. Kids would be bullyed all day in school and always had a horrible time. But when they got to go home they could be comforted by their family and friends. Computers have recently included a system where you can video chat with friends or @ORGANIZATION2. This can be a wonderful thing unless used in the wrong way. As I pointed out before kids are bullied a by in school but when they got home they were able to leave that horrid life behind and be a normal kid. Not any more. This new @ORGANIZATION2, video chat, @CAPS4, etc. has brought the unlucky bullied students a one way ticket to getting cyber bullied. I have heard of a case where a student was cyber bullied to such an extent that she suicided on the internet to show how depressed she was. Computers made that event possible. Video chat, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc. gives bullies a chance to make their prey depressed into a point where they consider suicide. I can understand why you would contradict my argument but I truely hope that you will be able to understand why this is so important. Obesity, straining the eyes, & cyber bullying should be in my mind enough evidence that computers are bad to get you to write an article about these horrid machines. They are causing a variety of problems in peoples health, mind, etc. I really hope you will consider writing this article.",5,5,1
1433,"Dear local newspaper I think that the effects that computers have on people are that some people become very adictive to them, because some people spend lot of time in the computer doing noting because they just spend their money buying things that they don't need. I also think that computers affect people in the way that they don't spend lot of time with their family. The effects that computers have on people is that some people can't stop using them even if they want. People become very adictive to computers because they spend almost all their time in there. People don't exercise no more because they spend all their time on the computer, shoping things that they don't need they just buy them because they like them. The effects that computers have on people are that some people just to be talking to their friend on myspace. His facebook and other websites that are not good for them. I think that the effects that computers have on people are that they take away people's time because some people spend lot of time on the computers, living their family's alone without spending time with them. Computers take away peoples time because they don't spend time exercising or playing out side with friends or brothers or go to a park to spend same time with their family or have a contact with family and invite some friends to come over to have some good time instead of being in the computer all day without doing nothing. Computer's take away time or love for your family and they make you spend the time that you don't have. The effect's that computers have on people are bad because people can't stop using them even if the wanted to because they are all ready adictive to them. People can't stop using them because in the computers you could do lot's of things like shoping talk to friends and visit websites that have very interesting things from other countries that are very beutiful but some people can't stop using them because they go to play games or because they are down loding music from websites that they don't have to. In conclusion i think that the effects that computers have on people are very bad because some people spend lot of time on them and they even spend the time that they don't have and the time they need. I also think that computers affect people because they don't spend time with their family sharing good things. The effects that computers also have are that people can't step using them because they are adictive to them.",4,4,0

Recently it has been brought to my attention that some people agree that some people @CAPS3 themselves don't really use computers. Without a dout I firmly believe that people that dont use computers should start to use them. but I can understand why same people don't use computers. Maybe they dont know how to use one have better things to @CAPS2, or can't afford one. First of @CAPS5, they dont know how to use one. I remember when my friend was over and I was on a computer. and he @CAPS4 ""@CAPS2 you know that some people don't know how to use an computer?"" And I @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 who?"" the @CAPS4 ""@CAPS3 me, I dont know to use one."" I @CAPS4 well I'll teach you. Since then @CAPS5 my friend does is go on the computer. One day he says to me because of I want to work with computers. this is one of my reasons why people don't use computers. Second of @CAPS5, have better things to @CAPS2. @MONTH1 be someone has a game. for example, I mostly have how time to go on the computer. Usually I have a basketball game or practice I get home from practice and feel exhausled, @CAPS5 I want to @CAPS2 is go to @CAPS6. why parents come have not wanting to @CAPS2 anything. I'll tell you why. Because @CAPS5 that haved They @CAPS2 @CAPS5 day. This is another one of my reasons why people dont use computers. Third of @CAPS5 can't afford one. Some people dont have a lot of money to buy a computer. They have to say it. so they can live in a house. When parent's children asle for something parents shoudn't buy it. They buy it so you dont feel hurt. When I'm a @CAPS7 im going to make sure I have enough money to buy it. If not then I guess that child is out of luck. So dont be going where bragging your computer because some can't afford one. This is my last reason why people don't use computers. this is why some people don't use computers now in days. Because they dont know how to use one, have something better to @CAPS2 and can't afford one. By the way; @PERCENT1 of the pupils of @ORGANIZATION1 dont have computers.",4,4,0

I think this because: You can communicate with friends, they help you with school and a reliable resource for you need to find. Please read on so I can explain my reasons. Computers and technology benefit us in many ways. One of mom's they able you to talk to friends. Computers give you an easy and fast way to communicate with others. Instead of sending a boring letter that takes forever to get there, you can hook up with your friends, you haven't seen in a while. I remember when my friend moved to @LOCATION1.

Computer are a of looking in many different take days. You can go online and find everyone, in ten minutes. In fifth grade I had to do this really hard project. I looked in books @NUM1 days and find.

The question then is, @CAPS1 computers have good effects or bad effects on people. The obvious answer is bad effect. People constantly use the computers teach them bad habbits and can search inappropriate things. IF people are always playing games the computers then when @CAPS1 they go out for a jag. The answer is never. People who are constantly on the computer don't get enough exercise. One reason why a lot of people in @LOCATION1 are obese is because they aren't getting enough exercise. Computers aren't helping this situation at all. Some people say, ""@CAPS2 I'll just spend an hour on the computer and then I will go work out."" But, the one hour on the computer turns into two hours, and then two hours turns into three, you know it you've wasted the wrote day on the computer and didn't exercise at all. Also, there are so many games on the computer now that can be really and you don't to stop playing them. Yes some games can be really entertaining, but you don't have to spend all day playing them. You can play a fun game for fifteen minutes and then go get air. As you can computer can mesmorised a lot so they don't get enough exercise. Second, people go on bad habbits. For example, kids are always. On the website you can talk to your friends. On the computer the problem is that people dont use the. Too much and get too used writing like that. Then, kids @MONTH1 start doing that on writing in school and most even know it. Also, there are new websites where you can put personal information about yourself. This makes it easy for strangers to. learn your. Lastly is very easy for people, even to search inappropriate things. Everything is on the internet and little kids are going to be very curious about it. They can search inappropriate words ad pictures and no one would ever know. people can past inappropriate information on their own for others to see that can be impossible to take. And, if parents don't know that their children are searching inappropriate things, then the kids are going to keep doing it because they know they wont get caught. So, as you can see computers have a very negative effect on people. It causes individuals to no easy to inappiopriate things. So go and limit the time you on computer.",5,4,1

Computers help us with our job, school, work ect. For example science. Im in @NUM1 grade. My teacher @PERSON1 gives us homework; every @DATE1, we have to do @ORGANIZATION1 are @NUM2 facts about anything you want to write about. A lot of people look up bears on @ORGANIZATION2 and they do their assigment about bears.

Like a week ago I was chating to my cousin she told me her dog had @NUM3 puppies. My family also uses the computer, to order. My uncle went to ticketmaster.com and he ordered two tickets for wwe. He also orders his flight tickets in his computer, to go to @LOCATION1. Well my point is people use computer a lot because they are, very helpful in many ways. Its not good to just be in the computer it good to outside enjoy nature live your life exercise not only to be in shape, but for your health. @CAPS1 hope you enjoy and understand my opinion on computers.

98,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, In this new digital age, computors are beaming more and more advanced. You can do just about anything with computors now from talking to people, to learning about faraway places. It is not all as wonderful as it seems, though for people's lives have been ruined because of the internet. It is for that reason that computors are not a benefit to our society. With computors we can learn anyting, go shopping, and contact friends. For many, this deletes the purpose of going outside. You can live your entire life indoors. This lack of exercise can lead to obesity. Also, living this secluded lifestyle can cut off ties with your friends and family. In order to use computors wisely, we have to learn how to balance computor time with an active lifestyle. The problem is, not many people do that. Furthermore, going online too much has been known to produce a second life. With websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 you can have a whole different online life, with friends that you haven't even seen before. Sometimes, people have even been known to think that their online life is better and get sucked into it. Take @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 for example. It is very popular, but also extremly addicitve. Some play until their entire lives are devoted to playing. Same with @CAPS6 of @CAPS7. This obsession with online games or @CAPS8 is not what internet was made for. Also, peoples lives and reputations have been ruined by computors. Cyber bullying is spreading like wildfire. Its anonymous, and can be detrimental to the lives of others. Internet videos of people acting like idiots never go away. There is one video of a college guy playing with a golf hall retriever like asword called @CAPS9 kid. The video has been viewed over @NUM1 million times. The guy in the video was made fun of for years, sued the people who put the tape online, and was forced into depression. Moving on, people can literally get their lives taken away with computors too. Identity and credit card theft is becoming more and more common. Even my dad had is credit card account stolen last year. Computors must help, but they can hurt much more. In conclusion, computors are a detriment to society. the can hurt people, cause addiction, and seclude your life. Surely this isn't the grounds for something to help society. Truly this is a good thing to let people use.",5,6,1
1718,"Losing @CAPS1 to @ORGANIZATION1 are a huge part of daily life these days, which is good for businesses, and schools but for people just looking to pass time, computers are a dangerous choice. Yes, computers are a way of communication, and are helpful if a student forgets their homework or an assignment, but when it comes to boredome computers are bad. Social networking is scary in reality and too many young people are exposing themselves in making @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 page. Also excersise is a big issue now and you aren't getting any by at a computer. On the other hand though, computers open up new worlds to people. You can type in any question or place into a search engine and instantly get results. Computers like anything else, are fine in moderation, but too much of one thing just isn't healthy. Websites like @CAPS2, or @CAPS3, or @CAPS6, are scary when it comes to privacy. There is very little privacy offered and your page can just be put out in the public. Also these w ebsites are addicting. You @MONTH1 just want to log on to check your notifications but you can end up on the computer for @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours without even realizing it. Other pass time could be running on a tredmill or jogging there dont have benefits. All you can get from an hour on the computer is blurred vision. It would be okay to be on the computer for 1/@NUM1 hour a day but not using to the internet. Websites can be a way to find computer time. Edline is homework or an assignment. Google is helpful for research or vocab work. When websites like these are the focus on computer time, it is much more productive. Overall, I believe that computers have a negative effect on people if as many people that use computers balanced that time with time to excersise, they would all be better off.",5,4,1
1190,"Dear local newspaper, Computers are a waste of time! People that say they are helpful are just using that as excuse. Some people say they are good for research and talking to people. Both of these things you can do without a computer. Computers are just a money wasting thing that get in your way of life. People spend hours on computers talking to people. You don't need to do that. You can use a phone instead and call them. After a study they proved that talking on a phone is cheaper then using the computer. In this economy why wouldn't you want to save money while getting the same thing also on a computer you don't really talk to the person you are really just typing word to them. This can be very dangerous. Who know if the person talking to you is really the person you think. Why take the risk when you can just use a phone! Using the computer is like smoking. It is very addicting! People stay on computers for hours every day and don't get exercize. If you just sit there moving your hand you are not really burning calories. This is a huge problem! Obecety is already rising with the number of fast food places and computers are making it worce. And the worst part is parents don't care some children go on the computer for @NUM1 hours a day and there parents don't encorige them to go outside. Children need encorigment to get moviing or they will never start, and they will get bigger. We need to form a group to help stop this or before you no it @PERCENT1 of the @LOCATION1 will be obeise. Another excuse that computer lovers do is they say they are doing research on a country. Even though this @MONTH1 be true there are other way you can do this. Why not ride your bike to the library and get a book on the country. By doing this you will burn calories and get to learn the same stuff you would have on the computer. Also not everything on the internet is true so you might have false information. By getting a book you know it's true. People that love computers will never get away from them over night it @MONTH1 take a month or two but if we act new we can make a change and put a stop to it. Computers are a waste of money. You can live without then very easily, and without them the world would be a better place. People are being lazy and use excuses on why they need a computer.

1297,"Dear @CAPS1-republican, @CAPS2 do benifit society in a positive way, but they also have a negative affect. Computers allow people to chat/voice chat/video chat with family members in other countries that would be very expensive or impossible over the phone. They also provide learning experiences with many resources at your finger tips. One posotive affect of computers is that they allow you to connect with people around the world. Programs like skype and allow you to video/voice/ chat to people around the world at no cost. Doing such the phone would be very expensive. It gives you the opportunity to see family members you rarely see. Another positive effect of using computers is the resource and information provides too you. The internet has just about every piece of information possible. Doing a research paper go to wikipedia and topics you'l find information. The internet can prove to be helpful. The @CAPS2 offers you many good mind/puzzle games that you could not ordinarily do. There are alot ;of good things on the internet. Many things that help get your mind flowing. Cant afford the newspaper? Read articles and stories right on the internet. The last reason I believe @CAPS2 have a positive affect on people is because it replace. Many people, instead of going to the @CAPS3 will go to the @CAPS2. No matter what are you doing, you are usually doing more on the @CAPS2 than on the @ORGANIZATION1.

Second of all, almost the hole school use's the labtops, and the computers like @PERCENT1 use's them. The othe <@PERCENT2@NUM1> is students and adults write on paper, and that has good hand and combination. the @PERCENT1 is like all people go online, facebook, youtube, games, and google.

Even though I'm on the computer I still do things like talk to my family, I play basketball, and I chill with my homies. Now thats my choice to do all of that. I can easily just sit up in my room and be on the computer all the time. It's nothing wrong with doing that because that is my choice in life.

Do you think your job would be harder. I deffidently think that computers are making your job and everyone elses lifes easier. With the computer it teaches hand-eye cordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places, and it gives people the ability to talk to each other. I belive the @CAPS4 technology of the computer is defidently helping out society. To start, computers are helping many people with their hand eye coordination. As you know hand eye coordination is necsicarry for a good driver. The @CAPS4 statistics that came out from Â“@CAPS2 drivers.comÂ” the rate of accidents has decreased over the past ten years. In fact it decraced over @PERCENT1. With all the computer games that they have for young kids it is improving kids hand eye coordination. Starting at a young age. With the games like Â“@CAPS3Â” a majority of kids are ridding bikes skiing or snow boarding by five years old. All of these activities require very good hand eye coordination. Lastly , the resources that help with hand eye coordination are being used to help special-ed students get better at simple tasks at a faster pase. Secondly the world wide web is teaching people of all ages about places that are located thousands of miles away from their homes. Something that I personaly use my computer for is to research a location and find history on it before I go on vacation to that place. The computers in our school has helped our classes in social studies. My teacher @PERSON1 said that he has been grading more strictly often and the grades are still up by @PERCENT2 on computer and internet research projects. I should also add in that using the computers our school is in communication with a school in @LOCATION1. Once a week we email our pen-pa. the computers have deffidently helped my schools curriculum. Finally, computers are letting people of all ages talk to buisness partners, friends etc. The social networking sites have kept @PERCENT3 of friends in touch found in Â“@CAPS4-techÂ” magazine. I should also add in it has reconected @PERCENT4 of friends from high school all due to the computer. Another form of online talking is vidio chatting which many people are now using for buissness meetings instead of spending the money to fly to the location of their meeting. Now, for one day you should track how many hours you are on the computer for your job. I can bet the number is going to be about @PERCENT5 of the time you are in you office. The computers have with hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places far away from home, and lets people talk to each other online. So do me a favor state legislator relize and come to terms how much society needs the computer.",4,6,0
402,"Dear local Newspaper, I think that computers have a exellent benefit for people. First family friends can communicate from a far distance. Secondly typing on the computer gives people good hand and eye cordnation. Thirdly they give people the ability to learn about faraway places. Lastly it gives student a chance to research a topic they are learning about. Well @CAPS1 do you think? Researcher @PERSON1 said that almost @PERCENT1 of family's live faraway from eachother. computers give the ability for familys to communicate wether its aim or a webcam chat. Also out of the @PERCENT1 of familys that live faraway from each other @PERCENT2 use the computer to comunicate. Hand and eye cordination, some people type without looking and some people are really slow. Typing on a computer give the great hand and eye cordination. Good hand and eye cordination could be used for many things. For example, playing sports or even a simple task like throwing something in the trash. Lastly, have you ever wanted to learn about a place faraway from you live or have you ever researched a topic for school? Well I have. Computer give people the ability to learn about places faraway. For example in the third grade I had to research hammer head sharks. Don't teacher always ask their student to look up a word or a topic on the computer? As I have said before I think computers have a benifit on people. I hope that my three reasons of contacting family and friend and hand and eye cordnation and lastly researching has made you think it a good thing too.

To many @CAPS2 today are sitting down in front of a computer, laptop, ecetra, while not enough are lacing up their shoes for a jog. Computers are ruining us, they deter our social skills, damage our health and cause us to be lazy. They are unbenificial to our society. To start with, millions of people sign up for @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and other website like these to reconnect with people. Do you realize what this means? Now no one has to get in a car and go visit any one else. There is no longer a need to interact with other life forms, nor is there a want to. Lets say there's a woman sitting on her couch. All of a sudden her face lights up with the thought of her friend @PERSON1. She gets up to go start the car, but hey eye catches on the computer. She bites her lip, trying to decide wether to go see her, or have an online chat. Feeling lazy, she sits down. Do you really want that happening to everyone? To late it already has. Moving along, i'd like to take a moment to talk about our health. As most of us knows, fresh air is good for us. Imagine this, you're walking through the woods on a trail. The crisp, cool air, tickles you skin, and breathing it in just makes you smile. Your entire body feels energized from the treking. With passels of days like this ahead, you can'@CAPS7 wait. Now imagine this, your sitting in front of a computer, in a hot, stuffy room. You back aches from being in this posistion so long. Plus you think your getting a cold and you have migrane.

I mean, when's the last time that you yourself went on a bike ride? I'm sure you know that it's good for your body if you exercise, but your to busy on the computer. I think it's safe to say that half of @LOCATION1 would rather update their @CAPS4 than get up and move. It's crucial to our health that we get active. To sum up, alot of us are pondering wether or not to spend more time on the compuer. Well here's you answer, ""@CAPS6'@CAPS7."" Not enough people are interacting now a days, their spending the best years of their lifes stuffed up in a house, and most importantly, let's face it, their getting fat. Computers are taking over our lives it's now, or never, make the change to a better and more satisying lifestyle. Please @LOCATION1, turn off the computer.",5,5,1

To be on the computer too much, your family will start to worry about you. If you were to stay on a computer for a whole day, taht causes people to think otherwise of how you are. Also if you were to stay inside on a @DATE1 and your friends come over but you say, ""I don't wanna go out"", there just drifting away slowly. Since I am a teen I stay up texting and talking and going outside and I hate to see on of my friend's on the computer when I wanna hang out. When I was @NUM1 or @NUM2, I used to always be on the computer for like days to weeks, until my friend's and family said don't let this get to you. I had a friend who was a good athlete and very funny and nice, but when his mom got him a computer, I didn't want to be his friend. When I was @NUM2 I use to get mad at everything if I couldn't use the computer, it was like I was a brat. Also I used to be big, (as in overweight) because I never went outside to exercise or in my own room. The reason being on why I stopped being his friend was he to get mad if I come over there to ask if he can come outside. Also when he did come outside he used to never do nothing or run because he was always @CAPS1 tired, @CAPS1 what I am trying to say is the computer can really change people in a lot of bad way's. The last thing which makes everyone change is what computer's can do now. For example, a game called @CAPS2 of @CAPS3 can get you addicted @CAPS1 fast, you barely do anything elese. Another bad thing is @CAPS4, sure you keep in touch with friends but if you stay on too long, it's basically hooked you into it. Lastly online chatting room's or games when you can create a person to look like you makes you think that's gonna be your life from now on. Also people think that computer's can do anything it really can't, everything a computer can do is like a drug it's addicting. Well I just gave you a little thing of a lot of thing's a computer can do but to refresh your memory I'll say it again. A reason why I agree is family and friends seem distant to you at times you get mood swing's and less exercising, lastly what a computer could do now. Since you know now of the danger's that can happen I suggest you rethink about computers.",4,5,0
620,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @CAPS4 you think computer have a positive or negative affect on people? I think it has a Positive affect. There are a few reasons for this. First, computers are used for education around the world. Second, it helps us connect with and meet new friends. Lastly, You can use a computer for world news. As you can see, those are just a few reasons. First, Computers are used for education around the world. For example some people use it to go to college online. Others use it to find information on things like egypt, where we cant go. Second, it helps us connect with, and meet new friend. We can chat with our friends, which is very useful. If we need to know what a homework assignment was we can just chat with a friend. Lastly, You can use computer to find out about world news. We can go and find out if something serious happened, like the earthquake in haiti. As you can see, those are just a few reasons I think that computers have a positive affect on us. I hope you agree with me. ",3,4,0
1348,"Who would have thought computers can have effect for people. People all over learn things on the computer each day. Of cours every body learns and reds new things because of the computer. @CAPS1 is even fun stuff todo on the computer. You can pick from many different music videos and music. And @CAPS1 are many ways to chat with people like over the phone on a cell phone. But @CAPS1 are computers too , @CAPS1 are many ways to communicate with friends/family. Also @CAPS1 is myspace, facebook and @CAPS2. Those @NUM1 are websites that you can go on to take to family/friends but theres others website that you can go on. But I would also like to comment something about the computer. I understand the computers lots of fun. Sometimes you need a brake you cant stay on the computer all the time. You must that you need exercize too. You must go out and enjoy nature. You should take awaile or ride your bike. You must understand computers are good for learning but not for eeryday life. The computer is good for learning but you should also go out and got some fresh air.",3,4,0
1607,"Dear who ever this @MONTH1 concern, I think that people spend way too much time on computers. They do not exercise as much. People sit inside all day instead of going outside to enjoy nature. Family's and @CAPS1's are spending less time together because they have computers to talk to each other. Computer's have become a negative influence on people today. People need exercise to live. It keeps us healthy. With all the fast food places pople need exercise more now than ever. People do not want to exercise if they have a computer to go on. A staticstic is @NUM1 out of @NUM2 @CAPS2's @CAPS3 each have their own computer in the house. They said ""I would much rather be on the computer than outside"" (@PERSON2 @NUM3 grader at @ORGANIZATION1). Even students do not want to exercise when they could be spending time on the computer. Human only have so long to live. There is beautiful nature outside. We do not enjoy our surrounding because we would rather be on th computer. For example @PERSON1 would rather spend her day on the computer than enjoying the amazing nature we have around us. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 students enjoy nature every week. A young girl about @NUM6 never apperciated nature until her parents made her stay in a month. She now loves nature. because it got boaring day after day on the computer. Family and friends are huge parts of our life. We want them to be apart of our big events. Because of the computer we can talk to them whenever or email a video of our big event. But would it not be much better for them to be there, @CAPS4 you on when it is hapenning. When I was around @NUM1 @CAPS5 grandparents used to come to @CAPS5 soccer games, but now they dornot because @CAPS5 mom just records it for them to watch. I liked it so much better when they were at the soccer games, @CAPS4 me on. ""@CAPS5 family and @CAPS1 are the ones I want at @CAPS5 events, not to just show them after the event happend. A @CAPS6 is that everyone wants to share their event with the family. Computers aren't that great. They make it so family and friends do not come to see you. Computers take you away from the beautiful nature that surronds us. It limmits you on exercise and makes you gain weight, which is unhealthy. I urge you to use your computer less and exercise, see family, and enjoy nature.",5,4,1
712,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computer have good or bad effects on people? It has been bought to @CAPS10 mind that people fight about @CAPS3 computers to @CAPS2 a doubt I think that computers have a positive on people. @CAPS10 think arguments are people find ability in talk online with other people and help with school work. First of all computers gieve in ability to learn about faraway places. This is really helpful @CAPS3 you @CAPS3 you want to learn about @CAPS4 you can go at the computer end google ""@CAPS4 @CAPS6"". By doing this you'll find a lot of info on @CAPS4. I should I tried it before. So that computers giving you this ability to learn about faraway places is really helpful to the human society. Second of all computers people to talk to other people around the world. This is really helpful @CAPS3 you want to learn about people from around the world. This is different than googling fatcs about other people. This is free because @CAPS3 you google @CAPS3 your online chat with someone you have a In @CAPS10 thoughts thats the best way to is helpful friends and family @CAPS3 they dont have of all computer can help with school work. This is helpful students could and the world or about a different This remind me of the time I had to @CAPS1 a project about the nine planets. I had to find a lot of info so that also means a lot of books and a lot of reading. So these I the easiest and fastest way to @CAPS1 @CAPS10 project. I went on the internet in @CAPS10 and get all the info that I needed. So then I completed @CAPS10 project and headed it in to @CAPS10 teacher. She gave me a @PERCENT1 for a project grade. I got a @PERCENT1 because I misspelled @CAPS10 name, but that doesnt matter. What I am to tell you is that computers help students with school work like projects. @CAPS2 thinking I know that computer have a positive effect on @CAPS10 three arguments is that computers give you ability to learn about faraway places, allow you to talk online with other people, and help you with school work. Please take @CAPS10 side and think that computers have a positive effects on human society.",4,5,0
1070,"I think spending a lot of time on the computer is not a good idea because @CAPS1 has bad things online. @CAPS1 makes people stupid, and @CAPS1 makes you lazy. Those are the @NUM1 reasons why you shouldn't stay on the computer all day. One of the reasons is that the computer has bad things online like kidnaps. I seen a lot of video and movies about kidnaps when an older men or women starts taking to some young kids and they go meet some place and the young teen or kid never comes back. Another reason is that the computer makes you stupid for example when I use to be on the computer all day I would get out to get something to eat and some times I would go in the bathroom to get food and then I notice that thats not the kochen @CAPS1 feels like I just woke up when I got off. My last reson is that computer makes you lazy. The computer makes you lazy because you just stay in the computer all the time sitting on the chair without sun light or exercise @CAPS1 will make you want to stay here more and its not good for you mind and body. These are my three reasons why you should not stay on the computer, the more you the more you will want to stay. So don't stay on the computer because there is bad things in there, @CAPS1 will make you lazy. Please don't stay on the computer for a long time.",4,3,0
176,"Computers and the @CAPS1 were a technological break through. It exposed to the average world, things that were never thought possitive. But as these things advanced over the years, they've become an addiction so bad of an addiction its begun to threaten peoples lives I've been given a choice to s'de with the addicting computers, or to offose them. The only clear choice is to offose. First off, computers have caused the world a decrease in exercise. Studies show @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people who use a computer, do not exercise with less exercise throughout the world, nations are becoming more over weight. This is a huge problem in the united states computers are main cause to why the @CAPS2.S is over weight and unhealthy by cutting down computers use, we can get our world back into great shape we can bring exercise and health back. Nextly, I'm sure you've all heard of online predators. It's scary just to think about, well as computer technology increased online predators numbers went up. I remember a couple of years ago, I was watching the news and a story came a normal teenage girl, being killed by someone she meton myspace. things like this still go on, and the rate at which they happen are in creasing. by putting people on computers you're putting then at risk of death this is an extreme problem computers have caused. Thus is the last efferct computers have, out of many that I'm going to state time on the computer, is time taken away from family and friends.This can ruin relationship in and outside the family. Now I'm sure you now many people have become extremely addicted to online games. the more they play these games the more they pull away from everyone they knew and loved computers are a leading cause in disfunctional families. they steal the user away from the outside word. these people need to get their families and friends back. You have to act now, before its too late and computers have over taken the world. If you know anyone who has fallen prey to a computer addiction, do what you can to help get them back we need to cutt back on any kind of computer use fast. Hurry, it's now or never.",5,5,1
1013,"I think people should not spend so much time on the computer. This are three reason a think that. My frist reason is if people stay on the computer for a long amount of time it can mess up the way you see. My second reason itis that you could be spending time with family and friends. My last reason is that people that sit all day on a computer gain more weight. First I think people should not be staying on the computer all day. Because it can mess up the way you see this can happen because from u looking at a computer screen all day or eyes can get mess up. I think u should never stay on a computer for no more than a hour. And sometimes u no u been on it for to long when ur eyes started to hurt. My second reason u should not stay on the computer for a long time is because when u are secting there. Doing wat you are doing. You can be messing out on fun thing that u can be doing with ur family our with friends. But some people would just like to sect all day end look at a computer screen and some people start not to like going out our even beeging a social person. My last reason people should not be on the computer for a long time because some people will just seat there and eat food all day. And this will make them get more weight. And this can make there life wader because now they are on heelthy they are just seating down all day anyways. And they should be going outside end running around. This are my three reason I think people should not stay on the computer all day. One it mess up they way u see, second you are messing out on fun thing u can do with our family, end last people are graning more weight when seat on the computer all day.",3,4,0
124,"I think that the computers are good to be used because anybody can use them at anytime or go on it whenever they want to. The reason why I think it is good is because you can contact someone that you know and talk to them whenever you want. Another reason is because you can play games or look for something or even make a research on stuff that you want to know or about something that you were always curious about. A computer is also usefull for better things like using it for when going to work or when a kid in school needs to do a report of project and needs to do it in typing and also to save stuff that you don't want nobody to use. Computers can sometimes be helpfull to people that really need it and that actually need to use it, but it can also be a fun activity to do if anybody doesnt have nothing to do. I think that the computer is awsome because anybody enough can open up their own website and create something what. A lot of people can go on the internet and open an account on a website; for example a @CAPS1 or a @CAPS2 or a @CAPS3 for that what to have an account. These are a lot of people that use the computer in a good way and use it for things that it can actually be used for. So I think that the computers are avery helpfull to people that like seaching for stuff that there curious about or to have to use it for good needs.",4,3,0
1132,"Dear Newspaper, I disagree that computers are important to people because they have research, online colleges, and online stores. Those are my top @NUM1 reasons and I'm going to give more details. My first main idea is that computers help students find important information help students find important information on a project. You can do on the wikepedia to help find information about the battle of @LOCATION1 and other important history. one example is I went to american history.com to find good information about @CAPS1 alley @CAPS2 and what happened there. People also look up a lot of stuff that involves school. You can get research about the earth and what happens to it. My second main idea is that computers are good for people is when you finish high school, you can go to college. Some colleges can be found on the internet and you can go to college at home on your computer. One example is my cousin. She goes to college on the internet because she has to take care of her two children. Whenever you watch television you see a commercial about online colleges because they are trying to tell you to go to school online. My third and final reason why computers are good for you people is that some stores have an online store where you can look at what they have in the store. Children like to go shopping alot but they can't go to the mall or the stores because you don't want to go. You can let them see what they want and buy it online than going to the stores. It can be shipped to your door without going anywhere. My mom sometimes orders from @CAPS3.C @CAPS4 so she doesn't have to go there. It gets shipped to our house in less than a week. There was my @NUM1 main reasons why people should have a computer. They can find research, online schools, and online shopping stores. This can help people understand computers.",4,4,0
178,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 play a big role in our world today. For example people use computers to get imformation, talk in chat rooms, mainly to talk to friends and fined friends. I think this @CAPS6 messing people up. My first reson for thinking computers @CAPS6 messing people up @CAPS6 because of the impformation that @CAPS6 on the website. For example people past, and blog lies about people online. This @CAPS6 ruining many people because this starts rumors and gossip about people. Also the lies that are being posted could interfear with many lives. Another reason computers effect the lives and people @CAPS6 the dangerous chat rooms. This @CAPS6 not good because your not familliar with the person your talking too. The person could have posed as another person and be very hipocritical. The result of this could be very unpleasent. Like you might give them you number, adress, @CAPS2 personal imformation. The outcome to endup in death, kidnapping, @CAPS2 ciber bullying. Lastly, I want to talk about the false imformation that @CAPS6 given to thousands of people online. Another words the""@CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 Your @CAPS4 love"" @CAPS2""@CAPS6 Your @CAPS7 @CAPS8 On You?"" @CAPS9 these things are placed on either side of your screen to get money from you. On the other hand they attract the readers attention. For example these passages are set to copy down your number, get your account number then take your money. This doesnt help our peole because its only there for your money. In conclusion from my veiwible stand piont I dont prefer computers a magnificient way for people to spend there time on.",4,4,0
1498,"Dear Newspaper editor I would like to make @CAPS3 about the benifits of owning a computer. For example you can learn many thing you would of never of been able too, you can also go in chat rooms and talk with friends or other people and it can even make teaching esyer too. Computers in many countres are standard and we use then to learn many things but if you bring one to the tribes in @LOCATION1 it will look like a alein object but once they know how to use it it can open there eyes for ever many people in remote ribes and areas dont even know theres been a man on the meon. Another great thing about the computer is you can pay bills such as taxes, insurance, credit cards and othe payments which is good so if you cant get of your house or the place is closed you wont get late fees and it can even help you save large amounts of money too. Many people use the computer to socialize by joining online website such as @CAPS1, twitter and myspace were you can talk veiw pictures and see what friends are up to. Also on @CAPS2 you can message friends too. Further more many people play games on the computer some are single player and some are online and have millions of players on at a time. you can also hook other gaming system up to your computer to play with other people and even yet hints and cheats too. The biggest reasons that computers are benifit though is that they revolutionized school now for homework instead of doing a work sheet you go on the computer and do it and print it out or email it to your teacher. Another reason the computer is amazing is that it makes research for projects and home work much more easyer, redrable and it ean give you a much more broader view of the topic. By far the best thing ahead the computer is the fact that many teachers use them to teach with and show videos. Therefore it is much easier to learn and under stand thing wich will help us in the future be successful. Also many kids pay less attention when a teaches is giving a lecture but when there is a computer playing a video it will grasp the students attention much better. These are all the reasons why I think the computer is a excellant invention and every family and school should own one I hope you will find my @CAPS3 very persuading and puplish it.",4,4,0
1624,"Dear @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2 you know that computer have been around since the @DATE1. Ever since then, many people have had a better life. Computers really help the elderly out a lot. When they need to pay a bill, they could just log in, pay it and move on. Another thing is if they need to write a letter, but their handwriting isn't that elegable anymore, they could type it, print it, and be done. This way the person receiving the letter will be able to read the letter. Computers are a fad that will never die out. Doctor @PERSON2 of the @ORGANIZATION1 in @PERSON1 said, ""The children I work with use computers everyday to build their hand to eye skills, ever since they have increased that skill @PERCENT1."" The corperate from @ORGANIZATION3 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people agree that everyone should have a computer. Computer help you out with projects and I think everyone should have one too. Are you ever sitting home with nothing to do? Well, why don't you go out and buy a computer to play with? Computers can help you do all types of things. If you like to play video games. then you'll love one of these machines. They have all types of game systems out there just for computers. They also have web sites you could go on just to play them. I'm sure most of you like to play games, so why not try it. A basic computer isn't that much if your worried about the money. So go out and buy one. There is a lot of people in college now and mostly all of them have computers. They make research easier and faster to find. Which would you rather do get ready, jump in the car, drive to the library, search for a book, stand in line, and check it out, or, get on the computer, search what your looking for and be done? You make that decision. When college students get stressed which happens all the time, they could turn on music from the computer to calm them down. Computers have changed the world in a good way, and they continue too. You should buy a computer today.",4,4,0
951,"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree with the experts when they say people are spending too much time on the computers. The reason for this is that one, people don't get enough exercise. Two, new websites have been made and people want to see how @CAPS1 works. Three, more and more teenage kids have the new technology. Their on @CAPS1 all the time, and don't realize their not spending any time with their family. Now that you know that lets move on to my first reason. First of all, people are spending a lot of time on the computer they don't have time to go outside and exercise, More people probably figure they don't need to go outside. Really they do, @CAPS1's important that they get their body moving and blood flowing through their body. Another thing is that we don't always need to get the answers off the computer. @CAPS1's east to find friend and play a game with them. Find something to do other than play games on the computer. Now that you know let's move on the second reason. Second of all, the computer network came up with new ideas for the computer. They now have facebook. More and more people use facebook now. This right here shows us they won't get out and play, this also means most kids won't do their homework. Another thing is that either parents set a time on the computer or they take @CAPS1 a way. Their is just so much amount of time you can be on the computer for and not get bored. Now that you know that lets move on to the last reason. Third of all, I would like to say people are spending more time on the computer than with their own family. The reason I say this is because @CAPS1 is important to spend as much time with family and friends instead of being on the computer @NUM1. We need to know also what's going on in our daily life. Another thing is that our family is way better than some game on the computer go outside with you family and play a game of wiffle ball. Now that you know that lets moves on to the conclusion. In conclusion, You have read an essay talking about how people spend more time on the computer rather than go outside to exersice, new website to keep them on longer, and not spending enough time with their family and friends. @CAPS1 is important to have a time limite on the computer and get up and moving. Don't be a lazy couch potato and sit on the computer all day get out and spend time with you family and friends, I hope you agree with me. ",3,4,0
1550,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 people use computers but not every one agress that it benefits society. In my opinion, computers benefit society. There are @CAPS1 websites that can help you find information. Computers also allow people to work easily. A third reason is @CAPS1 companies are able to use them to gain business. If you are doing a project or need to look up information about something, the internet is one of the easiest ways to find that information. Google.com has so much information about almost any topic you can think of. If you are a teenager that doesn't have a drivers license and there is no one to take you to the library, computers allow you to be able to hand in the report/project on time. There are also websites that find you direction, to where you need to go. Mapquest.com is a quick and easy way to help you figure out which way to go. Computers allow people to easily. If your family member lives far away and you don't have enough money for the phone bill, computers help you to not loose touch. There are websites that can help you keep in contact with old friends that you don't see anymore. Computers are one of the only ways that people fighting in the wars can talk to their relatives. They are not able to have phones and sending a letter can take a long time. Companies use computers for easy access to the public. If you are a new company, you can put a little ad on the sicle of the screen on yahoo.com and millions of people will see it. They of so use computers to make flyers easily and quickly. Making a hundred flyers by hand can take hours. But on the computers all you have to do is make one and then you can print out one-hundred. Using computers helps society. you can easily find what you are looking for and you are able talk to anyone you want. Also, it is easy for companies to attract business. Those are only a few of the @CAPS1 reasons why computers are good for society.",4,4,0
991,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 my name is @PERSON1 and I am writing to you because, I want to inform you about the benefits of having computers. I think that having computers is a great way for kids like me to learn more about things in the world. Having a computer also helps people in need and also inform people about far away places in the the world. I beleive if it wasn't for computers we wouldn't really know that much about our world. Computers also help us to send emergency messages across the world in @NUM1. Some people do not think that computers have an effect onour society but I for one think computers have a very positive effect on people. people also think that computers make people spend less time exercising, but I believe that it actually helps people to exercise because you can go gives different exercising techniques. In conclusion, I think that computers have a positive effect on society.",3,3,0
615,"Computers should be for everyone! Dont you think?, I do. And here's how @CAPS1 gonna convince you. Computers can basically be called a gateway to learning. Positive effects that computers have on peole is that, it teaches hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places, and even allow people to talk online with other people. These great qualities computers have for people are fantastic. Also the fact that computers just keep upgrading as time goes by. So, by you reading this introduction, I hope you are satisfied with what I am going to in order to show you that computers are positive devices and can be helpful to everyone. Firstly, as I started in my introduction paragraph, computers help teach people hand-eye coordinates. This i believe is a good thing to know because without it, there arent many things you could do. For example fly a plane. You wouldn't be able to do that without both hand and eye coordinates because you would have to manually move the plane, and check to see if everythings in order by multi-tasking. Furthermore, this is just one given reason on why computers are positive towards everyone's benefit. Secondly, computers give people the ability tolearn about faraway places and people. This is also good for people's benefits because, theres knowledge in every bit of it. Your learning about others cultures, heritage, family history, and so forth and so on. This could also help you in the long run with any job you want to do because knowledge can get you anywere. It can get you very far in life so learn as much as you can, and I beleive computers can do so. This is another reason why computers can be positive. As for the last reason, I say that peolple can also talk to other people online on the computer.This is also beneficial because again, like I stated in my @NUM1 paragraph, you can learn many things that way and meet new people. Now dont you think computers can benefit anyone! I do and will always have the same opinion that is positive towards computers. For my conclusion, I would like to say that I hoped you enjoyed every bit of what I had to say, and you can also agree with the positive affects computers have on people. I truly beleive that computers are beneficial to all people and should continue to be around. it benefits society, and I enjoy every bit of using it. Thank you.",4,5,0
68,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, I am writing to you about my opinion on the effects computers have on people. I believe that there can be both good and bad effects. Computers make things easier for people, but they are also too dependent on. Man-kind should use books for research also not just computers. Computers are very helpful for people. For example, if you really wanted to see a certain movie but you don't want to stand in line, people can go to movie tickets.com and purchase their tickets. Then, once you get to the movie theater, all that's left to do is walk over to the kiosk and redeem your tickets. Another example is that computers allow people to pay their taxes. There is special software that is able to be downloaded onto your computer. Once the software has been installed, it will usually lead you, step by step, through the process of paying your bills. It's much faster and much easier than paying ""manually"". These are some really good effects that computers have on people. Computers also have their flaws. Over time, computers have caused most people to be lazy. Some people have become too dependant on their computers. Business owners, or businessmen and women in general, are @CAPS2 on their laplops or blackberries. Everywhere you look there is another adult on the internet or e-mail. Not only adult's do this though. Students are becoming more dependant on the internet. For every assignment practically, students use google or bing. Sometimes they use or wikipedia. Students should just take the time to use their extbooks. The student body would rather watch @CAPS3, play video games, or text than do homework. This is understandds because homework can be boring but it all pays off in the end. Taking the extra @NUM1 minutes to use a textbook won't kill anyone. No one has died yet from using a book instead of google. Also, in using a textbook, you will understand how to do whatever you're doing. That isn't so bad, is it? Computers, as you can see, have both good and bad effects. It's easy to use the internet for homework but that doesn't really help you. Making purchases is fun though. It saves gas money and time. I hope you and the readers of this paper see my point of view.",5,4,1
1422,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 is your opinion on computers? Are they good or bad? Computers, have not been around that long but it is contrivertal wiether it has a positive or negative effect. True they do help people research certain topics but they are also hazardous. I believe computer are not a neccesity to people. Computers are uneeded because people spend way to much time on them, then we begin lack exercise, and they become hazardous to everyone. First, computers are not a neccesity because people send way to much time on them. Once you are on a computer for over an hour to an hour -and-a-half the computer will start to effect you in negative ways. For one your eyes will begin to hurt. If you stay on longer than that you will start to get a head-ach. Soon your head-ach wil turn so bad you cant bare it. It will pound and feel as if its on fire. This happens because your brain cannot take in the brightness of the computer and @CAPS2 your reading or seeing at the same time. Most of the time this happens eventually you will lock yourself in time a darkroom to rest. Sometimes you don't get off till they have a stomach-ach too. After they get off and feel better they go back on to repeat the process. This is why, computer are an obstruction to us. Next, people begin to lose exercise. After being on the computer for so long all they have time to do is eat, sleep, and go to work or school. Computer have deprived everyone of the outside. They don't want to go out and get exercise and play around. Living in those conditions can only lead to one thing, obysity. Soon you will become fat. Life will become tough. And being fat also has a negative effect. For one you cannot run very long, you become weak, and for kids you stop growing. But the worst is you will not live as long as you would if you were healthy. So you see computers are a nucence to our society. Finally, computers are hazardous to the envirnment. There are @NUM1 billion people in the world. At anytime about @NUM2 billion are on some sort of electronic device. When you are on a computer, have you ever noticed the hot air blowing out of the fan. Now, have you ever thought were this heat goes. Well, it makes holes in the ozon layer and causes global warning. The ozon layer is the only thing keeping the sun's ultra-violent rays from scorting us. Now if everytime some turns on a computer @NUM3 of the ozon layer disapeared and @NUM2 billion people are on that would be @NUM2 billion mm gone from our atmosphere. Now think about global warming. If the ozon layer is like a bubble, the heat is trapped inside. So this heat will eventually heat up the earth. This will cause the @CAPS3 to melt and then the sea will rise. The @CAPS3 has enough water in it to flood the earth. Do you reall want that. Eventually we would drown and life would seece to exist. As you can see computer are a nucents. They hypnotize the young children and adults. They be helpful but more hazardous. Sometimes we don't even relize this. Computers are bad because people spent to much time on them, people lose exercise, and they are hazardous to us.",3,5,0
1596,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I agree that computers had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and people and allow people to talk online with other people. More people should see computers as a positive effect on people. Spending time on a computer is a great way to enhance your hand-eye coordination. It also teaches you how to type fast. Typing is an important skill that you need for most jobs. It is so important that have throuhout school teaching us how to type. we also use hand-eye coordination is loaded and. You have to keep your eye on the and move your arms and hands to hit the. Computers are helpful in many ways. Have you ever about what looks like or what would be found on it? With a computer you can. Comuputers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. You can get pictures some important cities and places, and some knowledge on the people who lies there. Yes, you would do this in a social studies look buts is much easier and faster online. Computers save time and make your life easier. Computers are learning more and more advanced everyday. They give you the oppurtunity to talk with people online whether the world the street. In order to do this you need a web. They are sold in computer stores and some are already installed into the computer. Being able to talk with people online is a really great thing. Its a fast way to learn about that person and maybe about them if they one from a different country. Its almost like a pen pal last your in a computer. People are saying that computers have a negative effect on people. They say people are spanding to much time an computer and not on exercise. They also say that they are not interacting with family and friends. All of these things should be. All you have to do is manage your time. Or not all day on the computer. If you do this thinks everyone will say that computer your positive effect and are one of the last invention created. I would like to thanks all f the reader for there time and hope hat you all support me and my ideas.",4,5,0
56,"Over the past decade, the percentage of people using computers has increased by approximately @PERCENT1. All of a sudden the world and its people have become dependent on information that computers provide. The variety of data bases and resources the increased communication and the skills computers allow you to portray and prove that they are essential for this generation. Communication over computers benefit now society can interact between one another. Personally I have been able to talk and see my family who live overseas through the advanced technology on computers. Different communication programs include @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and e-mail, the most commonly used cite. Without having access to a computer and its contents residents have a difficult time embarking themselves within the rest of society. For school events, sport schedules, and keeping in touch with far away family and friends. Computers allow all of these essentials to be part of society, and the way this generation has decided to start our lives. Paretns and teenagers these days have become very lazy in comparison to the way they used to behave. They are nit interested in going to the library in order to research information on people, places, and family heritage. Computers have been a huge convenience in a persons life by allowing all the information that was once in books to be contained throughout the internet. For example if you are doing a project for school. the internet will provide you with any information you need. It is truely astonishing how much one electronic instrument can impact and influence a life. Being a student, I am commonly curious about what references teachers are making and additional information that is not provided. The internet allows any person in possesion of a computer to research what they have wondered about and to give a response on the subject almost immediately the benefits of computers can practically cover the few negative effects as it is a way to let a person discover various information on any desired subject. Besides searching for information, computers can be used to document data of your own. Microsoft has invented several applications of which allow you to graph information design presentations, and neatly record drafts of writing. No person is flawless and is incapable of mistakes. Microsoft helps take your exentuated imperfections and hide them by doing things as little as making a neater copy of your essay, or putting your lists of data into graph form to make it more eye-friendly to viewers. Society has become reliant to sources scattered throughout the date bases on computers and by directly looking at the negative effects that a computer can have on aperson and therefore putting restrictions on this information source will enable society to have to positive donations that computers these days have on our way of life.",5,5,1
850,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever thought about how computers effect human beings? The impacts? The results? The education? I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow people to talk with others online, have the ability to educate in certain areas, and teach hand-eye coordination. Who says the only way to contact or communicate with someone is through letters or the phone? The technology brought upon using computers allows people to talk online with others in a fast, easy, enjoyable way. Have a question that you have to ask a friend, but someone else is using the phone? Write a letter! Oh wait, letters can take up todays and your question is urgent! The computer is an easy alternative for communication. Say you're an amazing singer with a beautiful voice and you want to find an agent more than anything. Computers are so advanced in technology that they can find you an agent in no time. E-mail, websites, @CAPS1, and more, are all ways you can contact that agent. Computers are a great way to communicate. The mind is an extrordinary thing. It can be filled with knowledge, and still have the ability to learn and understand more. Reading books is a fantastic way to learn, but the internet has so much more to offer and you are not only reading from one great author, but tons of great authors. The computer allows you to learn about far away places and important people without making that trip to the library. Have you ever heard of online colleges? They are advertised on @CAPS2.V. all the time. Some people @MONTH1 think that learning from home, laying in bed with a laptop placed in front of them is a distractive way to learn. But what about being comfortable and not intiminated by anyone else around you? Computers can help you get your college degree in a comfortable environment. Hand-eye coordinatin is an excellet and wonderful thing to have. Along with videogames, computer games teach you exactly that. Parents @MONTH1 think we kids are wasting our time playing games on the computer, but we are actually challenging our minds and our hand-eye coordinatin ability. Computers are key when it comes to pysicological learing. Handeye coordinatin is taught to us through games and such that we play without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination allows us to catch a ball or play sports, and computers help us acheive that.",5,5,1
689,"Suppose you have a family member that you have not seen in a long time and you dont have enough money to visit them because they live to far? Or you are injured or sick and you have nothing to do, so you decide to just browse the internet and you actually learn some interesting things like what new organism has scientist found out or something in history you've never known before? Amazingly, the computer is filled with knowledge like this. You could talk to family members you haven't seen before or just havent got the chance to see them in a long time. You could even know a lot of new interesting stuff about nature and history you would have never known about by just stepping outside. And just so you know more, I'll even tell you about these things. I have a half sister who I only get see like once a year or once two years. But the only way I get to interact with her is on facebook. There is also websites people use to talk to loved ones like twitter, myspace, yearbook, aim, skype ect. Not only do you just talk to them you could do a webcam chat, so you could also see them. Alot of people use webchat to talk with old friends. While on the computer you could also learn new things. Yesterday, when I was on the computer I got bored and did some random searching, and in that @NUM1 min. I learned things I never heard about, like the ""@CAPS1 massacre"" and that time when a teacher went into a spaceship for the first time and it blew up with the teacher in it. Man was that a tragedy! If you were interested in nature you could learn about all kinds of nature around the world. Also, if you are interested in ancient time with a few typing you got all kinds of fascinating things of ancient time like @PERSON1, the city that was forgetten, then found. I'm pretty sure you couldn't learn that kind of stuff stepping outside. The amazing things a computer could do! Talking with family and friends you haven't seen in which to be decades and learning fascinating things. Usually it's cool because you could learn things your teacher never new. Would you want the teacher teaching you or you teaching the teacher!",4,4,0
144,"Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion computers are a help to our plant. The new technology makes life easier to handle. The computer are a help because it teaches hand-eye coordination. You can talk to people, and it is a new way to be entertained. Computers can teache hand-eye coordination because of typing. Whether someone knows it or not when you are typing fast it is help you hands. Also the fact you that if your typing without making is also helping because it makes your hand easier to move. The typing is giving your hand lots of exersise because your hands are moving all over the place. The more you move them the more excersise you can get. Computers can really help hand-eye coordination alot. Computers can also help by talking to people. To talk to people far away is better to talk to on the computer because if you have a webcam you can see each other. You are able to talk to people from different countries. Also computers are able to be used in business meetings when a business has to talk with another from different locations. Like if part of the business is doing a project in hong kong, then the boss can set up a meeting to see how it is going. Another way to use computers to talk to people is to speak with a person you are not able to see in person. Like if a oerson is in the hospital but you're not able to go, then you can talk while seeing each other throw the computer. Computers are a great way to use in communication. Computer are also a new way to get entertained. They can entertain you because there is games that you can play. There are games that come with the computers and a lot of games on the internet. Other they being bored all the time you can play thousands of game with just a click on a mouse. Also to not be bored you can watch videos like youtube. You can listen te musicor watch comedy videos. Video also show a way do express what you feel and sat it in comedy, horror, or sad videos. Also for teenagers there is ways to talk to their friends like facebook. On the website you can talk with anyone on your friends list. In the end computer can help kids, adults, or teenagers. With just a clicking your mouse you can find a new powerful way of technology. And be able to got better hand-eye coordination talk to people and get entertained. So go get yourself a computer and amazed!",4,5,0

Well with todays great technology you can do that on the computer! I can see that the experts are trying to decide whether or not computers are the healthiest thing that benefits our society but in my opinion I think they are great! As you @MONTH1 not know I am @NUM1 years old and have a @NUM2 year old brother; we spend alot of time on the computer not just for homework. I like to shop online for discounts and sales where I know thing are cheaper than in stores. I know my brother likes to go to concerts and buy himself the latest video games. My grandparents are older and don't watch alot of tv and read the Newspaper so the computer is great for catching up on your favorite tv shows and or the news. With these great pieces of machinery you can chat up a storm with old friends on facebook, @CAPS2, and @ORGANIZATION3. @PERCENT1 of teens @CAPS5 are shopping by brand names, like: @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS4. All of these clothes and designer stuff is everything we want, but half of us don't have the money. If you go on the computer you can get all of these names and items for less than @MONEY1 compared to %@NUM3. Computers lower the price of things we want and need. I, @CAPS5 a days grandparents try to have a decents conversation with their kids or grandchildren but they go right vack to when they were little. As a grandchild to my @PERSON1 all she used to talk about was her days going through the great deppresion, but with computers she got to catch up on the news and @CAPS5 I can sit down with her and have a great conversation. You can also catch up on the shows you are missing when everyone is talking about them in school. The kids won't be missing out! When I was in @NUM4 grade I got my first facebook, I thought I was so could! That @DATE1 I went to camp and met all these new kids and found out that they all have facebooks. @CAPS5 I keep in touch with them, with out lossing my friendships. You see, I know the scientists or experts are probably smarter than a @NUM1 year old girl but I know that most teenaters and parents have facebook and say its great because we connect with people around the world. So I know these experts are going to make the best dicision on whether or not computers benefit our society but please take my ideas into consideration.",5,4,1
1122,"I believe that computers have a strong negative effect on society but a stronger positive one. Computers these days are very advanced and allow you to talk to your friends, allow you to acess information more efficiently, and have increased our man power in scientific research. Almost every teen has a screen name that allows you to chat online with your friends. This function keeps kids in touch and active. Eventhough instant messaging can distract kids from their daily life it can also be amazingly helpful. Just last week a friend of mine had forgotten to write down their homework and easly contacted online. I was able to let them know @NUM1 a matter of seconds. Like wise, with this online communication you can also talk and and video chat as if you right there with your friends not everyday do you get to go hang out with your friends so this is an easy alternative. Not only is quick and easy it's free. Computers keep kids off their phones and from jucking up the bill and causing those loud annoying phone bill conversations how to limit your texting. The most important effect computers have on society is the gathering of information. The internet allows people to acess millions of websites and light speed. Every second of the day their is someone on the internet searching for date that they would have to go to the library to get. Computers are a key part in society and we depend on them without them we would all be lost. They provide an easier way to life that us lazy @CAPS1 need to survive. The internet keeps us updated and informed on whats going on all around the world without even going there. We need the internet and we couldn't acess it without computers. One of the largest aspects of life computers have helped us with is research. Computers have multiplied our man power giving us more organized way to store date. Recently I was watching a show where they had a computer testing items for @CAPS2 a process that would take a human weeks. They also help us be different and more creative people. With the computer came smaller more compact computers till they were able to fit in the palm of our hand. They have lead us to think we can do greater things in life and keep our earth safe and to stop damaging it as much. They're lead us to research the unknown areas of the world where @NUM2 years ago a scientist with a pad of paper didn't have dare to even think about. Computers have linked the world through communication and information and have exelled us to greater heights in understanding how we came to be. Overall society needs computers and they have and overwhelming positive affect on society.",5,5,1
1112,"Dear local Newspaper, In my opinion I belive that computers have helped our society a lot over the past decade or so. This is because when you on the computer you get better hand-eye coordination. Also you learn how to type and do other things with a computer that you will need to no how to do if you want to get a decinte job that pays well. Also now on the computer you can go on facebook and other website were you can make friend and chat with other people. So its not only helping your social skills and hand-eye coordination but also you are most likly to get a good job if you no how to type and use a computer. First off, having a computer teaches you to have better hand-eye coordination. This is because when you get a computer having better hand-eye coordination will teach you how to type better and more quick. Secondly, having a computer will teach you better social skills. This is because now alot of people go on facebook and you can make friends and chat with your new ones. Also when its a cold and rainy day you can occupy youself by playing different games and also you can check the news and forecast for tommorrows weather. Lastly, when you learn how to type you have a good shot at getting a good job because you no hot to type and work a computer. This is because when you are looking for a job that pays good you will most likly have to me how to type and operate a computer. @CAPS1 in @CAPS1, in my opinion I think computers have helped our society over the years, but other people @MONTH1 think differently.

624,"There are many great things about computers. If we were to loose them then our lives would change dramatily. You can use computers for exercise then it is also up to the @CAPS3 on limits. Last it can save lives Computers are great, if we were to loose them. There would be no more internet. you would't be able to talk to friends on @CAPS1 or e-mail. Cell phone prices would go through the roof. We would technacly be going back @NUM1 to @NUM2 years. Last with out computers there would be more diffeculty in large companies Computers can help exercise. One way is we can find closest gyms on the internet. We can find what is healthy to eat right away You can also get one of those @CAPS2 fits for a computer. Also you can find free work out videos. Next, it should be up to the @CAPS3. It is their discretion if they see that the child is spending to much time on the comuter and gaining weight they can easaly limit it. they can say for very hour your on the computer you have to do an hour of exercise. Lastly the computer can save lives. Before computers medicine like tylonal was used for everything. Stuffy nose, headache, cold etc. Now we can go on the computer to find weather the medication is at all dangerous. You can also find the nearest hospital. Finally, computers can do a lot of good, even though it can make less unhealthy if you spend to much time on it it can save your life. It can also destroy companies and our lives, @CAPS3 can give limits and computers can used to exercise. So reading this essay please don't take away our computer",4,4,0

Sure they might be on @NUM1 hours in a day but they do other stuff in between like school, meals and activities. Some people need computers for their @CAPS1. News @CAPS2 companies need computers for editing and printing out the papaer. They also put the news on there website. What would most people do without a computer?

1551,"Dear local newspaper- I understand that computers are becoming more of a ""must have"" in peoples everyday life. I believe this is a great thing! If you're on the computer you type which helps improve peoples hand-eye coordination. Also, you can learn more about people, places, cultures and much more. Lastly, you can communicate online with other friends or even meet new people. To begin, I think having computers is a good idea because it helps people improve on their handeye coordination. My cousin @PERSON3, who is a big time baseball player, used to have trouble catching the when he was younger. He kept trying over and over again and never gave up. Then, for his birthday his parents bought him a computer! He was so excited, but when it came to typing papers, he wasn't the best. Not only did he practice baseball but also typing. His family realized that buying him that computer was of the best ideas. It improved his baseball career (by throwing and catching the ball) and increased his grades in school. However, @PERSON3 is not the only one that has gained hand eye coordination from computers. A recent study from yale college shows that @PERCENT1 of people that use the computer for atleast a month gains some sort of hand eye coordination. @PERSON1, a teacher of the computer class at high school states, ""@CAPS1 freshman that I get in my class tells me that computers have made their sports careers easier because they now have better hand eye coordination."" Computers have two things in one, you learn to type and help your hand eye coordination. Do you want you @CAPS3 to be lacking that positive ability in life? In addition, computers help you learn more about people, places and cultures. I heard a couple nights ago that @ORGANIZATION2 had an earthquake. I also learned about the powerplant explosion in @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. How do I know all of this you ask? The front page on @CAPS2.com! But, i'm not the only one who has gained this knowledge from the internet, so many more have too. @ORGANIZATION1 took a poll about how many @CAPS3 use the computer to do research and @PERCENT2 answered that they did. Does the society really want to take away @CAPS3 knowledge of whats going on around us and our history? In conclusion, people can communicate with friends and relatives. This is great if you haven't seen them recently, or if you want to just stay in touch. For example, @PERSON4, mycousin, just found me on facebook. I haven't seen her for eight years abut now I talk to her all the time. We talk about visiting each other and how our family's are doing. But, you can also talk to your friends too. Studies show that @PERCENT3 of @CAPS3 between the ages of eleven and eighteen talk to their friends over facebook on a daily basis. Dr. @PERSON2, a teen psychiatrist, says ""I think this is a great idea for @CAPS3 to communicate with other @CAPS3 through the computer. It gives them the chance to interact in a different way."" @CAPS3 have such a good lifestyle for them, do you want to feel guilty for ruining that? Finally, people have perfect opportunities right in front of them. Computers help improve hand eye coordination and helps you learn. It also lets people interact with others in a different way. Do you think that these golden ideas are bad for our society?",4,5,0
606,"Dear newspaper, In my opinion, I believe that kids and adults spend more than enough the on their computers I can see how it benefits you in some ways but it keeps you away from halwe, being outdoors and excersizing. It also can have an effect on your eyes in your later life. People go on @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, and @CAPS1 search engines and a little more than half those site's results are fuke. And the more people go on computers, the easier it is to yet caught pladurizing and that is a big thing in the community. Those are some ideas, but I have some more don't worry and details to go along with those ideas. People need fresh air, excersize for their body and to enjoy the outdoors. You can do all of that stuff if you just get off the computer. And instead of searching the places online and what their all about, just go visit them. You will get fresh air, excersize and experience. And after having that experience you will pass it on, teh real to ohter people will not get any of hot fake stuff. For example, you can search @CAPS2 online and they just have pictures food. But if you take visit there you will get to really last the food. Would you rather being sitting in a chair, staring at the computer, or having fun outdoors visiting places you have never seen before? You will never get or learn anything by pudurizing plus you will get than and get clicked. But if you think a little or maybe had experience with your writing tool, then you will learn and. That is also because kids are too lazy to it out because they are not outside doing things and they're inside and used to they becausethey are so their computer all the time. I guest I also agree with using computers because they give you skills they going to places don't give you. Like, you also need skills, mainley, hand-eye coordination for typing the long papers for collage and those skills will get you for in life. It's like a chain reaction, you type on the computer a lot, you will have good hand-eye coordination if you have good hand-eye coordination, you will do good in school, and it goes on. And you end up being successful. Another benefit with computers is the sales, more and more people are buying computers which helps the economy so I guess I agree but my opinion will stay strong with not using computers. So wether you have a computer or not, if you dont I prefer not to get one, but get off your bum and do some excersizing and visit those topical islands you always visit.",4,4,0
1599,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers are not necessary. Some believe that they help us learn, but I just say so do books. Some people believe @CAPS2 can help to be more hand eye coordinated, so does playing catch. Most believe that internet teaches about people in faraway places, I say why not visit those places then you'll know more than what was typed in a computer. @CAPS2 it was computers against books I definetly would conqure with whomever roots for books. A good book is healthy. To me, reading a book on the computer is one of two things, unhealthy and unethnical! You can't read a book on the computer and even @CAPS2 you could it is not as fun as turning the pages of a beautiful paperback or hard-covered book. I Believe that you can learn so much from what you read in a book, (A real book)! When you type on a computer, do all that, ""clickety, clickety""!, you say that it's learning because you learn to type without looking, hand-eye coordination. I say no! that is not natural. Why not go out side and throw a ball to one another? That's a real way to show hand-eye coordination. It's a fun game and it's easy, plus it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you want to surf the web to find a nice vacation spot, you should really just visit that place. Flip a coin heads @LOCATION3 tails @LOCATION1, @CAPS2 you pick heads, stop surfing the web to get info on that place!. go fly there and surf the totaly radical waves. Surf the real waves next the artificial ones dudes! So as I restate, computers might seem okay and i guess they aren't all bad, but they are not my cup of coffee. So take time away from that computer and go read a book or play a game of catch. You know what hows about a trip to @LOCATION4 or @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION3.

Look, if you want to roast computers then by all means, roast away. But if you do so without first regarding all the angles of them, then you, my friend, have absolutely no standing on the situation. You could say that they are a neucence but could never have used aho. You could argue that they can be used to detonate bombs, but, lets be practical, how many normal people actually wake upwake up and point out the drearyness of life and then type in a command to detonate a bomb? A serious benefit you have obviously choes t o overlook is the invaluable information it aptly places in front of you on a @NUM1 inch screen. You can read book reviews, read books, bag things, and get the cutting-edge news you want, to name just a meager amount of possible strengths. Further more, not everything that you speculate as bad has to be bad just because you say it so. When you think of @CAPS3. Do you always think about vulgar, inappropriate pictures, and illegal images? ThatÂ’s funny, because @CAPS3 keeps family in touch, gives people things to do, and keeps friends in different states on the same server. Youtube is not all swearing and bad videos. My family casts actors for shows, and one way they know what an actor is capable of is by going to their channel and looking at the videos that they have created. My mother actually contacts actors in videos to see if they want to become professionals. That is the business, finding talent where it is seldom found. Lastly, did you even think about the fact that computers are used to start companys and saves lives? You probably didnÂ’t even know that, from a computer, astrologists monitor images of the universe captured by the hubble space carrier meteorologists track cloud formations from satellites using a computer. Maybe you didnÂ’t choose to say that surgeons can dictate operations from their office in @LOCATION1 on a patient in @LOCATION2? You didnÂ’t even say that seismologist use computers to traet the shifting of the tectonic plates to see where the epicenter of a major earthquake is? You just didnÂ’t know. So, letÂ’s face it, computers are important. You probably used to do what little research you did them. In fact, pardon me.

I think computers are an amazing breakthrough in modern science. I believe computers are ideal for school work and comunicating with others, as long as they are used in moderation. Computers make school projects so simple I don't know if we could do without. Our social studies teacher @PERSON1 says that @PERCENT1 of his projects involve something on the computer. The internet is a great place to research for big papers and projects. With over thirty-million educational and informational websites, its easy to locate what you need quickly and easily. Once you have finished researching it is easy to type your report. If it isn't a written report, then there are many other programs for fancy presentations. Take microsoft @CAPS1 for example: you can make exotic background and texts, as well as unique animations to emphasize or to make it pop right off the page. Computers are also an ideal way to communicate with friends and family. Emailing is quick and easy to tell others what you want to say. If you want to chat, then you can use @CAPS2 or instant messaging. This allows you to type and sent emails faster. Both of these programs are an inivative way to talk with a family member that isn't home. Like lets say my dad goes on business to @LOCATION2. We can email back and forth every day. And now with @ORGANIZATION1 (a video chat) you can see the person and actually talk to them like they're back at home. Computers have their advantages but they also have disadvantages. Computers are great for communicating and school work, but when used in excess can be unhealthy. Here is one example: my older brother @PERSON2 is a senior in high school. He is in school from @NUM1 to @NUM2:pm and as he gets home he heads straight for his computer. He is on there for at least five hours a night and that leaves time for dinner and not much of anything else including sleep. I think that computers are a great invation in modern technology as long as people limit themselves. Computers are coming out with new features everyday and who know theyll be like...",4,5,0

I think computers has positive effects on people like me. Computers teaches hand-eye coordination. It can help if you need to find out reasearch for a school project. You can create lots of things on computers like music, desiner @CAPS1-shirts, logos, banners and lots of other creative things. With computer you can look up available homes and apartments. You can even go online and fill out a job application and save trips to stores @CAPS2 cool is that!!

Thats why I think that computers has a positive effects on people and you don'@CAPS1 have to be super smart to use one.",3,3,0
1633,"Dear @CAPS1, I think that computers affect our country in a positive way. Three reasons why I think so are comunication, @CAPS2, entertainment and, @CAPS3. One of my favorite things to do is talk and when on of my best friends moved away and I lost his phone number I thought we had no way of doing it. One day he requested me on facebook and from there on we have been comunicating on web sites like facebook, myspace and, skype. My second reason why computer's benifit our society is @CAPS2. At my dad's house I do not have a television so I rely on the internet to keep me informed on what is going on in the world. A website called @CAPS4.com was the frist to anounce @PERSON1's death befor anyone even suspected it. Stories like that often break rest on the internet. The third reason why computers benefit our society is entertainment. You can watch videos, play games, listen to music, comunicate with friends. The last reason why computers benefit our society is @CAPS3. Many @CAPS3 in our comunity require computer skills such as a acountant, a manager, software designner, and a computer programer. The computer make @CAPS3 and more eficient by correcting mistakes, providing a visual and typeing. These are the reasons why computers affect our community in a positive way.",4,4,0
1033,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 technology was grown exponetially during the last few years. The use of computers especially has sky-rocketed. However, I beleive this is not somthing to be excited about. The use of computers all the time can effect people's health, family and friends, and their apprciation of Nature. The ove useage of computers is a huge problem. Have you ever sat infront of a computer screen for hours on end? If so, you know the feeling of sleepiness and irritability. The lack of exercise while using a computer impacts people more than they realize. Excessive use of ocmputers has been linked to obesity and high blood pressure. the more people use the computer, the higher their blood pressure. Just sitting infront of a screen is terrible for people's bodies. To stay healty, only use the computer when it's absolutely neccesary. Going on all the time can seperate you from others. This g eneration, adolecents especailly, use the computer to comunicate with others more than actually talking to them. Communicateing only over the computer can draw them away from people socially. Not ot mention how fast rumors and secrets spread over the internet. Useing the computer can ruin relationships even those with family. Being neglegent of family by always being on the computer can draw people apart. Families can became a non-important thing. People can't pay atttention to their families while sucked into a computer screen. Computers are creating false substitutes for almost everthing, even nature. Humans started out living i nthe wild, gathering food from the land and giving back by raplanting. Our connection with nature was strong. We needed it to thrive. Nowadays, however, instead of listening to the sound of rain and the crinkling of dry leaves, people prefer high pitched artificial beeping and the classic ""You've got mail."" People do not appreciated nature as they used to, as they should. The beauty of nature is simply overlooked as if it's nothing special. Well, without it we wouldn't be alive. Life cannot exist with nothing to thrive off of. We can hop on our computers and look at pictures of nature on @ORGANIZATION1. com, or we can grab our shoes and see it for ourselves. No one can experience the greatness of nature while on the computer. No one can experience the feel of cool lake water sliding over their skin or a hot @DATE1 day while emailing a friend. It can't be done. Computers have robbed us of our ability to experience creature. In conclusion, computers are horrid for people. They can affect health, friends and family, and appreciation of nature. We must use computers only when neccesary in order to stay healthy. Instead of going online, get going outside.",5,5,1
450,"Dear Readers, I believe that spending time on the computer has its pros and cons. For the good things people are able to do research talk to people such as friends and family and also the computer can help you learn about anything you need to know about. I also think that there are some cons. People spend way to much time becomming distracted, you ignore your family without even knowing it and if you are just staring at a computer screen which can perminatly damage your eyes. I'm going to start with the good things about how computers have effects on people. The computer is great if you have to do research. If you need information on anything you can search it. Like if you have to do research on a certain project or subject the computer is the fastest way to get the information you need. Another good thing is that you have the capibility to talk to people such as friends and family. To me that is very important and I'm sure for you it is too. Thats what I believe a few of the good things are. Now, I'm going to talk about the bad things. I firmly believe that people are spending way too much time on the computer, without knowing how long has gone by! You just stare at the screen, which is not good for your eyes. It can perminatly damage them. One last thing I would like to mention, is that when you are on the computer they tend to ignore their friends and family which could be a big problem. These were just a few examples about how the computer has an effect on people.",4,3,0
1741,"Dear, local newspaper, @CAPS1 you like computers? I @CAPS1, computers help you learn about all kinds of things. Plus computers let you chat to people on there computer even if you can't call them. Another reason why I love computer are because when I have to write a project I can just type it!!! Computers make eveything easier. So, @CAPS2 consider liking computers. Initially, imagine you have a project due in two days. Your mom can't drive you to the library and you have no information on the subject. But hey, don't you have a computer. You can use the computer to lock up your subject and a @CAPS3 different websites will come speed quick to your screen. Most of then will help you learn about the subject and then you have time to finish it and hang out with your friends. Secondly, @CAPS4 @CAPS5!!! you frogot what page of the book your suspose to read. Also you lost all your friends contacts. Not to fear super duper computer is here. You can email or chat to your friends online and see what pages to read and get there phone numbers back. Did you know @PERCENT1 out of @NUM1 People said that the chat & email programs are @CAPS6 because they can contact friends, family, and co-workers. Finally, you can type your essay on the computer. Writing a @NUM2 paragraph essay takes to long, so use your computer to help you out. Go to microsoft office and type your essay. Computers make writing an essay really easy. @PERCENT2 out of @NUM3 people said they like typing on the computer more then writing it on @CAPS7. in conclusion, Computers are @CAPS6 tecnollogy when you have to chat to someone. Also when you learn about something. Another reason why computers are @CAPS6 is because you can type essays & papers, @CAPS8, @CAPS2 change you @CAPS10 of computers are bad to computers make us @CAPS11!",4,4,0
1499,"Dear @PERSON2, @CAPS1 your latest article on the goods and bads of computers in our society was informative, I believe you left out a few major reasons why technology is doing more harm than good. If people don't become aware of the consiquences, who knows where our world is heading? First off, I'd like to mention the health issues associated with technology in general, but especally computers. Dr. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION2 states that ""@CAPS2 since the popularity of the internet boomed with the invention of websites like '@CAPS3' and '@CAPS4', we've seen a drastic spike in obesity-related heart disease and diabetes."" And @PERSON3 isn't exaggerating. Because of the sudden boom in electronics, more and more people prefer sitting on the couch with their brand new laptop or @CAPS5 then go for a bikeride or play a game of fastball with friends. Because of this, more and more people become victims of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and bone elipses that could leave them paralized for the rest of their life. Is playing that online game so important, to you that its worth your life? Next, I'd like to touch on the fact that @CAPS1 the internet @MONTH1 seem like a great place to do some socializing, it can actually aid in losing friends insted of making them. I know what your thinking, @PERSON2, 'But sites like '@CAPS6' help people connect, why would they lose friends?' @CAPS7, really. Since its so easy to type in a conversation, people are losing actual social skills. They also spend too much time talking to friends without meeting face-to-face, and that eventually causes them to drift apart. And when talking to someone over a screen, its so hard to know if your actually close friends. Because of this, they cant bond and they wont have a real friendship. @PERSON4, a @NUM1 year old at @ORGANIZATION1, says that him and his best friend now only talk over @CAPS3, and they dont even feel like true friends anymore. So finally, I have a request. Next time you turn on that laptop, think. Is this really worth losing your friends and even your health @CAPS2? Next time feel the urge to update your status with something like '@CAPS8 got home,' @CAPS8 call a friend over to go hang out at the park instead. Trust me, you'll be glad you did. Thank you for the time to read my letter.",5,5,1
1299,"Dear @PERSON2, Have you ever noticed how different our society is today, even from just ten years ago? That's because of computers. Yes, it is true that computer give us advantages like messaging and information, but they also take away from some of the greater aspects of life: staying fit, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends. Without those, life would be horribly unbeneficial. While surfing the web @MONTH1 be fun, it has been proven unhealthy. ""if a person was to spend more than two and a half hours on the computer every @TIME1 for about a month they would see a sudden increase in their gain. And if they kept the behavior up, they could gain up to one third their initial body weight until medical help was provided,"" say @PERSON3, a specialist in obesity at @ORGANIZATION1. Also, @PERCENT1 of all computer users snack while online, which only increases weight gain even more. Unfortunately those that spend alot of time on the computer are not usually okay with exercising either. Instead of outing down just a half an hour out of their computer time to play with the dog, take a jog, or try some aerobics, computer lovers usually just stay in front of the screen. That's too bad, because it causes health problems for them and maybe even the generations after them. Nature, is being ignored @CAPS1, more than ever. @PERSON1 can recall the time when the trails @CAPS2 runs were overrun with people. ""@CAPS1"" @CAPS2 says ""They're being overrun with woods and. Those are harder to act rid of that people."" But it's live, the trails and that to be fuller nature lovers are numbers. Because of today's new technologies, especially computers, the beauty of nature is being almost completely passed by. Some worry if it will fade entirely and instead of trying to maintain what's left, well just let it do so. Hopefully though, the next generation of people will reconize this horrible mistakes. Doctors, @CAPS3, all people alike are seeing more and more how computers affect family life. How often do you eat dinner with the whole family. When you don't, where are you most of the time? At the computer? That's what I thought. When computers and other technologies are available there is much less of a chance that you will actually interact with family and friends. mrs @PERSON4, an @NUM1 grade teacher in @LOCATION1, noticed that her family spent less time together than ever before when each family member got a laptop. @CAPS2 believes this is pulling her family apart. Do you? As you can conclude, computers have an awful influence, on society: people do not take, the time to stay fit, nature is being completely ignored, and Family interaction rates are poor. Whaat can we do to fix this problem? Just set a little time aside daily to observe these aspects of life. This way, life with computers will be beneficial after all.",5,6,1
1002,"Dear Local newspaper, I think computers are great sources. They help us instanly when we have to find something. Computers are very helpful and they are easy to use. Once you have mastered the computer it feels like you can do almost anything on it. Computers are great but the can also have negative effects on us too. I like, computers but I am going to say I am against them. When people get on their computers it's like they're in another world. When your on the computer you are alot less socal than you would be if you not on the computer. On don't know about you but alot of people are addicted to their computers. They get on an they stay on forever. The act like it is a neccesity to be on the computer every day. I do not have to be on computer websites like @CAPS1 and here is why. Compters get really annoyting sometimes. They distract people alot. Like the other day my sister and I were going to @NUM1 walking but we didn't go because she wouldn't help us exercise so we shouldn't be using it. In this economy it is important to have socal skills. Instant messaging people doesn't mean you are going socal skills. You actually have to get out and talk to people face to face. When I am on the computer to long I know. I know this because my eyes start to hurt. This is bad for your eye sight. People sit in their houses and just stare at the bright screen. They @MONTH1 not know but that is blinding so they must not stay on the computers long. These were some reason why you should not use the computer. I am not saying that it is an evil contraption I'm just saying, use the computer for info and work not for games and other things. You could be outside having fun instead of sitting up in your house so get out! Go make some real breathing friends in person.",4,4,0
51,"Dear Local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered how to get somewhere and you didn't have a map or @CAPS1 near you and the only thing that was the near you was a @CAPS3. Well I am saying you should go on it and search were you want to go. Computers are very helpful in every one's daily life they have so many facts and interesting things on them, @CAPS2 about again trying to figure out were someone lives it's very easy, go on google and type in someones's adress and there you go. The @CAPS3 is also very good because have you ever thought about one of your friends or a special someone and you havent seen them in like a really long time and you miss them well no problem mostley all computers have some sort of camera in them were you could video chat or just chat regular on the enternet. That is very helpful because even though you could just go on the phone and call them it's better to do it online because how about if you havent seen them you want to see a picture of them they could just send it to you on some sort of chat page or just your email. It is so much better then mailing one picture in the mail and it takes days for the mail to come if you could do it the faster way on line and on video chat it will be better.. The @CAPS3 is also very helpful because how about one day you want to go some were and you dont know what the weather is going to be well you could go to put on the tv and see but there is so many communications and you cant really see because they move the weather days fast. On the @CAPS3 you could type the weather in for one week and it will tell you and you could look at it for as long as you want and it will stay there so you could see the whole week without the screen having fast as the image is not in the light light or if it's to dark. The @CAPS3 is so helpful. People do say that it is good to get off the @CAPS3 and go for a walk outside in nature I do agree with that but people and children do get their exercising by walking around the house and going outside going shopping. Computers are helpful and nice and another thing is say one day you are online and you are looking at clothes or shoes and you want to buy them but you dont want to go to the mall a half hour away from were you live you could just buy them online and they will be shipped to your house and you dont even have to lift a fingure. They are also good because they have like a dictionary on it were if you dont know how to spell a word you type it in the best way you can and it corrects your spelling and tells you what the word is, also the computers have pictures of everything, if you want to see how something looks like you can type it in and shows you. with all the facts I have given you I hope you agree with me that computers are very helpful nice and safe.",5,4,1

Looking at places far away is always an option. You can even simply use it to help with homework essays. Locating and researching, even going to different countries, even different continents is possible to do on the computer. You can buy plan tickets. reserve rooms, even reserve tables at resturants in different countries by just a few clicks. Another thing is, you can research countries, towns, and cities with google instead of having to go out and get books. Reading about and talking to people from different countries is always an option. Being able to talk. and read about people and go to countries just by a clicking a button is pretty amazing. Computers also allow us to talk and communicate to people when there is no other way. The computers give people the ability to talk and see people they they the would never communicate with anymore. An example of this is my father hadn't see his father since he was two, but he started communicating with him and we were able to see him and chat with him through web chat. So these web chatting websites; ooVoo, facebook, myspce, skype, etc, is allowing people to reconnect. This advantage is allowing friendships and relationships to continue, is that really bad? Computers can help people with their homework and essays. For instint, they can type and print their essays instead of having to write it on paper. This helps because first it makes their, it also can be changed quicker and easier. They also can get information about what they are studying quickly and more efficiently. Instead of searching for a word in a big dictionary they can use an online dictionary and just have to type in the word. Online dictionary also have prounociation help and different langages. This helps so much so they can get their work done and exercise, enjoy nature, or interact with family and friends. I hope you will take my opinion seriously and think about it is using computers for daily needs really that bad?",5,4,1

I think using computers can help you learn new things and meet new people. Slick, slack, slick, thats the sound of people typing ont he computer and meeting new friends and having a good time. When you learn something new like a rat is as big as a house. You get excited and feel your the smartest person in the world. I dont think its a bad idea to use computers because some peole who have jobs work on computers all day. I think people who uses computers all day while the're at work dont have to be classy, topuler or trendy, they just working to help themselves and theior family.

They can help you learn new things meet new friends and give you something to do when your bored. i remember the time when I was bored and I went on the computer to google who @PERSON1 was and I found out she was a famous sinher, someone I didn't know but heard about.

129,"Hi! My name is @PERSON1 and I think computers are not bad. I think this because yes, people do play the computer to much, but they can also learn a lot of things. Another reason is that some kids like bullys can stop bulling and spend time on the computer to stay away from stress. You can also talk to your friends and even video chat with them too. Computers can teach you a lot. For example @CAPS1 your computer breaks or has virus you can just figure out the problem by yourself. You can also learn or read the news that your missing. For example you can also ask questions that you don't understand and people would answer your question. In moder afoot kids, teens, and even adult computers to look up things that they don't understand. For example, when I read along a book and read a word that I don't know and read around @CAPS1 I still don't now I would go to @LOCATION1 and find what the words mean. Bullys and other people like street people that have computers should stay on the computer and you can just play games. They can play hitting games, shooting games, and even board games. You can even watch fights @CAPS1 you want. What ever you want you got it. This is a good thing because then no one will get and everyone will be happy. Bullys can also go on the computer to relax and stay away from people that they hate. The computers can make you relax because you don't have to be around people and you can just tell the computer to do what ever you want. Kids, teens, and adult don't have to leave the house justto talk to a friend or two. I said this because most computers hace a microcam and you can comminicate with others. For example my dad is trying to get a computer with a micro-cam so that he can be incontact with my mom, my brother, my sister, and I. He has to get one because the doesn't live with us any more. He had to leave and go back to @LOCATION2. Another example, would be that @CAPS1 one of your friends move far, far away you can just talk to them on the micro-cam or even send message back and forth. So I think computers are not a bad idea or a bad things. I say this because you can learn, stay good, and communicate.",5,5,1
11,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 people acknowledge the great advances that computers give us, but they also put us at @CAPS1 disadvantages. Computers have been known to help develop health issues. As people become more intune with the online world, they tend to interact with their family less. Don't forget the danger of online predators - they're deadly. @CAPS1 people who do nothing, but watch television are often refered to as cauch potatoes. Those who are glued to their computer screens are no better. It is stated by numerous of @LOCATION2's top doctors that too much time spent on the computer can cause damage to your health. Exercise is highly stressed by doctors around the globe and the only exercise a computer addict will be doing is typing up a storm. They can submerge themselves into obesity. This often causes depression as it begins to sink in. Addition itself is a serious health issue. I wouldn't be surprised if they add a computer wing to rehab centers sometime in the near future. These problems are slowly spreading and we must come together to abolish them! Family time is an treasured value, to the @CAPS2 people, but lately, computers are ruining this tradition. With so @CAPS1 people absorbed with online drama, friends, and even video games, family interaction is declining. People slowly remove themselves from reality and enter an alternate world of cyberspace. They @MONTH1 only emerge from their rooms to use the bathroom and eat, scarcely resting. This can cause great tension or sorrow in @CAPS1 families. Who can erase the horrifying stories of abduction from their memories? Online predators are highly dangerous and extremely clever. Your children could be talking to someone they believe is another teenager looking for a friend to console in when, really, they are a forty-year-old serial killer waiting to find the right time to attack.

As my mom says only an hour aa day is good. One reason why it is important is because you need to enjoy what life has to offer. You could do stuff like play catch with the dogs walk the dog, and (or) play over a friends house. Yes, playing on computer is fun, but you have to execise to. (you know) @CAPS2 reason why is because you can end up somewhere where you did not even need to go to. You could also make lots of new friends by going out doors. Like that's how I met trees, animals, beautiful senery. You could feel like you were having the time or your. The last and final reason why this is you can get a lot out that you could use. you could make snowmen in the winter or if it's raining you could watch a movie. you could build a lot. In conclusion building, playing and jumping (the list could go on) You can enjoy the outdoors. Just rember the three good reason why are you could use the wonderful and lovly outdoors. Go walk you dog, have friends ober or even just having out with your family and friends.",4,3,0
922,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 more people are getting involved with using the computer while I think that is great other don't. I believe that using a computer is a good thing because technology is going to progress and computers will be the base, also computers are safer now because or privacy options and virus block. Finally, computers help you gather knowledge that no one book could tell you. Although technology is progressing computers are only the basics. Sooner or later everything will be based on computers like, jobs, school, and ever the medical field. Jobs will have more computers and touch screen devises because they are easier and more technologicly advanced. As for school @CAPS1 students have to take computer classes to learn how to write brouchures and make websites. The medical field is now using more advanced ultrasounds that take the image and make it there dementional. So, if everything is changing around you why do you want to be stick in the past? Although, some people are worried about internet saftey and viruses, there are ways that those can be limited. As for social networking sites don't set it up for the whole world to see. Set it up for only your friends to see. Also, make sure you know who your friends are. As for viruses, don't go on websites that cause viruses. Also, you can get a virus blocker that helps eliminate them. The computer also helps to give you and get you knowledge. You can learn about cocrent civilizations. Or modern day without taking a step out of your house. Also the internet has vertual simulations so you can experence what it was like in other coultures, in other time pericals. Computers give you knowledge that help you through your life especially if you don't have a library. Even though some people disagree computers are the base of technology, safe, and full of knowledge I do. Yes, they do have some flaws but they are a great learning tool.",4,4,0

This is a huge benifit because a computer is one of the few tools that could help you expand your learning with a click of a button. Having a computer also allows you to talk to family and friends.

Sometimes internet is not good for children. Sometimes you need take a break and slow down. You can take a trip and see your family. You can also look out to nature. Exercise, hike, swim and bike. Computers are not family there are not going to make you exercise there going to make you lazy. Now that you've heard about why you should stop going to the computers because you have electronics, libraies and family. You stop and make a change right now. There nothing to loose. ",3,4,0
1101,"Dear, @CAPS1 I am writting this article on computers to inferm you my oppinun on computers positive and negotive efects. The reason why computers are so succsesful is beacuse of some of the great imformation they. Such as directions to a place until you are going to or home imformation on a subject or a pearson. Althoug these all sound good any one can post imformation on the internet so some imformation misnt not all be accrate. Some reasons why the computer is bud is beacuse of signs wich are not safe and can give your pearsonal imformation to a and comeing back to bud you in the future. Also webite or pop up icon are not suttebul for younger kids and exposeing them to to mature for them. Lastly talking on the computer is apart of our everyday lives such as emails almost every american whita computer here. A email, this is a great to relie or. Also the new sorse of web witch giving you the ability to see peaple and into the computers wich is raipidly growing in the @LOCATION1 @CAPS2 all in this article this you my point of veiw on computers.",4,4,0
403,"Dear Local @CAPS1, I think that computers have a posotive effect on people. There is many ways computers can have posotive effects on humans, first computers bring people together and let people interact with each other, They let people talk to each other. Computers also let people learn about new things. The internet has so much information. Computers also let people do things that they can't do with out computers. So computers have a positive effect on people. Computers let people interact with each other. The computers bring people together. People can use the internet to send emails to each other. When you need to write a letter to some one it might take days for them to got it. But with email they would get it the second you send it. There is also website like face book that let you talk to your friends websites like that connect people. When you and you freind cant talk together you just have to get on you computer. Computers also have web camera, those let people talk to echother. and you can see them. It lets people see the other persons facial expressions and hear the there voice which is better than on a phone and writing a letter to someone thats why computers are a positive effect on people Computers also let you learn about new things when ever you want to find somthing out or if you have a question you go to the internet. If you someone else they might not know the answer. Computer let people see pictures and videos. If you wanted to see a picture of @CAPS2 are that you are going into a computer and type it in computers let people see pictures that they couldn't see in real life. Vidios let you watch things like something funny to cheer up you day. If you love a show on to, and you missed it you can find it on computer. That is why computer benifit people positively. Computers also let you do things that you couldn't do without. When a teacher asks me to type a paper I always do it on the computer. If there were no computers I would have to use a typewriter and if I made a mistake I would have to type the whole thing again. Computers also alow you to play music. On the computer you can put a cd in and it will play the music. Computers alow you to do things that couldnt do without Computers benifit society an have a positive effect on people, They let people interact with each other and they bring people together. They let people talk to each other. Computers also let you learn about newthings. They also let you do things that you couldnt do without. Computers have many positive effects on people so I hope you agree that computers benifit soctity",4,4,0
1547,"Dear local Newspaper? Today i am wrinting this letter to you on computers. I belive that the people who don't have computer's have the right to say that people are online rather than exercising. My three topic's are they teach hand-eye coordination give people the ability to learn, and allow the people to communites. First, the computer's are'nt just for talking about!

387,"Dear, editor @CAPS1 you know, @PERCENT1 of children who spend most of their time on the computer that do not exercize can develop weight problems and blood disorders? That is just one way that advances in computer technology have affected people so far. If advances continue that number will increase and other problems @MONTH1 arise from it. Some other problems that we have @DATE1 that could get worse are, developing a weak immune system, and emotionally seperating yourself from your family. First, lets talk about obesity. Obesity is a terrible sight to see someone go through because of something as silly as being, basically, addicted to the computer. Not only can obesity constrict vital organs but it can lead to blood disorders. Blood disorders, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, can cause you to have a heart attack. Which cuts off oxygen to vital areas of the body. Which leads to, eventually, promote death. Dealing with obesity is bad enough, but seeing them suffer because they have developed a weak immune system is horrable. In my experience I find that people who are on the computer often generally don't have very good immune systems. For example, a friend of mine is on the computer quite often, and has developed a weak immune system. Because of it he misses at least @NUM1 day of school a week. And because he misses so many days a school year he usually keep bad grades. Which is yet another reason why advances in computer technology are a bad idea. So isn't it relatively obvious that advances in technology are a bad idea? Especially being that, children are steadily becoming obese, and developing a weak immune system can affect your life in ways that are totally controllable? So I urge you to write an article about this to stop the growing sickness known as health problems due to technology.",4,4,0
667,"Dear, @CAPS1 paper @CAPS2 The computers we have do benefits our society, because it makes people smarter, it's a way to talk to people who live far from where you live, and it's a great way to do homework if you still in school. Having a computer is a great way to get you smarter.You could go on diffrent websites to help you learn what your stuck on in school. I remember the time I was having trouble in math, so my teacher gave me this website called a @ORGANIZATION1. It goes over on waht you need help on, and you get a live tutor. The computer could teach babies how to talk. It taught my cousin how to talk and he's @NUM1 @NUM1/2 years old. Isn't that amazing on that computers can do. Next I will talk about how computers are a great resource to talk to far away people you @MONTH1 know. When you have computers you could talk to people that live across the @LOCATION1 woudn't you want to talk to somebody long distance without paying extra money on your cell-phone? I remember one time I was talking to my dad cause I had no minuts on my phone and it went great talking to him on the computer. Having a computer is kind of like a bigger cellphone. You could talk to a family or a friend if you or they don't have a phone. Lastly, I will talk about how you could do homework. Having a computer you could do a lot of homework. Last time I was on my computer I had to find out about @PERSON1 for math, so I typed his name and his biography came so I wrote about him. You could use it for all subjects especially language arts you could type up papers and look up diffrent things you had to do in class. Would you want to write a @NUM3 page essay and makin your fingers cramp up just writing no. so you just go on the computer and type it up without cramping your fingers @CAPS3 reconsider your opinion, cause computers can get you smarter, talk far away people and help you with homework.",4,5,0
414,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that computers effect people? I think I @CAPS1 agree that computers affect people. I @CAPS1 agree with this statement because people dont get use to doing other things then stay on the computer. One example is that people that @CAPS1 stay on the computer wont have much fun on other people. They wont enjoy as much by stay on the internet. My last example is that doctors sometimes say its not good for you to stay on the the computer. First of all, people that stay on the computer wont have much fun on othe poeple. I know one of my friends love to get on the computer and stay on it for a long period of time. One idea in that there not alot to do on a computer for some people. People dont go out and have fun like going to the mall with your friends. Some people try to focused on the computer if theres something importent they have to do. Thirldy, people wont enjoy themselves. When @CAPS2 on the computer I really dont enjoy myself by just sitting there on the internet. One important fact is that you wont want to enjoy a beautiful day with your family when ther going to the beach. People will take maps for a while and not want to go back to sleep and you wont have nothing else to do for the rest of the day. Sometime you wont have a good life without enjoying it. Lastly, doctors say its not good for you to always stay on the computer. One important fact is that you always need to excersise instead of lamping around. Sometimes might happen to your eyes because your steading looking at the computer. You need to do healthy things to help your body. In conclusion, I had agree on the statement and my reasons why was because you wont have fun. You wont enjoy yourself, and doctors. Say its not good for you I hope you liked my prompt so it can go in the newspaper.",4,4,0
254,"I walked into my living room. I saw my brother on the computer talking to his friends on facebook. I thought to my self he's always on the computer never for any school reason. People always says we don't need computers I personaly agree with the statement. In the town @ORGANIZATION1 everybody mostly has computers. Without a computer to look up for content things, you have to go to the library and check out a bank. Just the other @DATE1 my friend @PERSON1 went to the library and checked out a book about the @CAPS1 culter. He loved that book he read it @DATE1 in and @DATE1 out, he read it for a book report on different culters. When he handed it into the teacher the @DATE1, when he reached the classroom the teacher looked @CAPS2 happy when she gave him back his test he had an @NUM1. He didn't use the internet your computers not mobile like a book if you wanted to learn about something while your traveling in you car you can't plug your computer in and use it unlike a book. Also books are usually funnier to read. Not haveing a computer can conclude to a lot more things like exercising. While my brother is inside all @DATE1 me and my friends are outside playing football, basketball, baseball, soccer, kirkball, and dogeball. We are very thin because @CAPS3 what we do almost every @DATE1. Unlike my brother were he is obeast because @CAPS3 all he done were before he had the computer he was as thin as us. It is also unhealth to be on the computer all @DATE1 because that can lead to staying update at night, don lead to missing the bus, and also lead to bad grades. Where when we are done with are gaine we whatch a little t.v.. then go to sleep to regain our energy we usually have atleast @NUM2 hrs. of sleep ever @DATE1 which lets us make it through school. We also make the right choses in food to eat to have more energy such as fruit and vegitibales. Were my brother eats all the junk food which helped lead to obesity. Not having a computer can help you spend more time with your family. When we go out to eat my brother is always in a push to get back on to the computer dosen't let us enjoy our food. He usually is @CAPS2 much in a rush he picks off of other people's @CAPS2 they would be finished faster, when every one wants to enjoy then food. When we want to go out to the movies my brother stays home on the computer. Even if we buy a movie and whatch it at home he won't whatch it with us he's on the computer. It really makes my mom, dad, brothers, and sisters mad that he won't do any thing but play on the computer. Even when are whole family gose out side to play a sport he won't come out and play. It's like he's not part of the familiy anymore. Its like he forgot we were even @CAPS3 the reason why I think computes should be in the state of @LOCATION1. If can lead to and relly bad grades. @CAPS2 if you want your kids healthier, better grades, and spend more time with your family then ethier sell your computer or This is happening all over the world.",5,5,1
69,"Some people think it is a good idea and same do not. My opinion is that, I think that people spend a lot of time for good reasons. Here are three reasons why, @NUM1. grownups working, @NUM2. students learning how to type, and @NUM3. communicating with others. My first reason is that parents do a lot of work on computer. For example, they do taxes, paperwork, airline tickets, and the bank. And those are usually all done on the computer so it would be easier if people don't drive. My second reason is students need to learn how to type so they can email or even write on paper. It helps them build learning ability and also, so they can know how to sing the @ORGANIZATION1's. Computers are suppose to be fun for people of any age. My last reason is, communicating with others is a great skill to have so you can talk in person. Computers help because if you mess up of what your trying to say then you could just erase what your trying to say. And in person, you can't. Also you can make plans with one of your friend on something if they live really far or something like that. In my opinion. I think people should be able to go on the computers to do work, playgames, no sites, and many more other things to go on, only if you have a computer at home.",3,4,0
1158,"Dear newspaper I think that there are many reason why computers are good for people. Compters are good for people because they help keep friends conected. Reason two is that they can be great knowledg   for people. @CAPS1 third reason that computers are good for people is that there are many programs that are team based and help people with teamworks and team building skills. Those are three of the many reasons why I think that computers are good for people and have had a positive effect. First of all, I think that computers are good for people because they help keep friends connected. If you move to another town, go to a colledge far away, or move because of a job you will most likely, if @CAPS5 is further away, loose connection with you friends. But, using a computer can solve that problem. In social networking sites like @CAPS3, twitter and myspace you can simpily look up your distant friends from  you previoulsy lived and have contact with them. Youi can catch up with each other, recall good times you've had, end maybe make plans to meet each other sometime. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS2 have been reconnected using social networking site on a computer. Experts also say that @CAPS5 is important to stay connected with your past to sustain a well being and to be happier. I have had an experience when a scoial networking site has reconnected me with a @CAPS2. When i was younger I had a @CAPS2 whos grandmother lived  to @CAPS1 dad. After a little over a year of  him being good friends be moves to @LOCATION1, I thought I would never hear from him again. Later that year I also moved to a different town, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 searched me on @CAPS3 and we got connected again, I have found out he moved back to where I use to live. That is the first reason I think that computers are @CAPS4 good for people. The second reason, @CAPS5 is that computers can be great knowledge scources for people. If you ever need to set information   that not have to  through the  of book,then, a computer is the thing for you. As long as you than  to find an accurate and reliable scourse than a computer. Is an amazing tool. You can look up almost anything and you will be able to find locks of information on @CAPS5. Statistics show that you can find @PERCENT2 more information on a computer than a book. Experts have stated that soon books will be obsolite and computer will rain  as knowledge scources. That is the second reason why I think computers are good for people. Last of all, I think that computers are good for people because there are many programs that help with teamwork and team buildings skills. What I  by programs is yes of course videogames. Almost all of the computer games out have multiplayer features. Withins the multiplayer universe there are match types that involve a great amount of teamwork. In the age games you must communicate and talk to your team if you want to win. And that is the only way you will win is by using teamwork. That is @CAPS1 third reason why I think computers are good for people. In conclusion, I think that computers are good for people, they help to reconnect friends, , knowledge, and build teambuilding skills with programs that are out for @CAPS5.",4,5,0
931,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think computers have both good and bad effects on people. Some people just sit around all day playing games and being lazy. Other people actually use their computers for things that they need. Also some people need their computers for their jobs. I do agree that some people who spend all day in front of their computers are spending less time exercising! Would you rather play games all day instead of spending some quality time with your family and friends? Not me, I would much rather be with friends outside or having a family picnic at a park or lake. For other people though, the story is much different. Some people need computers and other advances in technology for their everyday life. A lot of jobs today require you to use a computer, for example working at a bank you use computers all day! I also think students rely on computers to do work too. A lot of students type up reports and other things for school on their computers. Students also use computers to look up information. The internet can be a very good source for students. I know for me, the internet has come in handy for school projects, or maybe something as simple as just looking up a word. I can also see why people dont really care about advaces in technology or computers! Some people dont need them for anything, and some are probably thinking people are on them way too much. To me, I honestly find computers useful because I can talk online to my family in @LOCATION1.

When your on the computer all day everyday your missing out on whats happening with your family you miss out on every thing that's going on. I think people need to relax on spending time on the computer and get some exsercise or call one of your cousins brothers or even your mon and find out what really up because they are the ones that really matter!

193,"Dear @PERSON1 weekly, The new millenium brought a new wave of technology. Computers is the main invention that most likely everyone uses. The computers teach us great things such as learning about a vacation spot or a far off country. The computer allows us to talk to friends or family while they are away or even home. Also, typing on the computer teaches us hand eye coordination that can help us with other things. The computer is surely a great invention. Have you ever wanted to go on vacation to somewhere overseas? Well the computer is a great source for learning about these places. The effects it has could be significant. One day some one might want to go to the bahamas, but then finds a new location such as @LOCATION1 or even @LOCATION3. In addition the computer benefits students very well. Students usually have to do projects on places in the world and the computer is the main source of intelligence. When I have an essay to do I always use the computer first. Recently my grandmother moved down to @LOCATION2 and I can only talk to her on the phone. Although on my computer I can actually see her on my screen. The webcam allows me to see me grandma. The computer allows you to keep in touch with friends and family that you do not see on a regular bases. For example @CAPS1 or twitter keeps you in touch with friends from high school. The computer can also send emails to friends and family so you can say hello every once in a while. Sports require a great deal of hand eye coordination. The computer makes you better at this. By looking at the screen while typing, gives you a boost on your hand-eye coordination because you are doing two things at once. A sport that requires a lot of this is @CAPS2. While the ball is in the air you must focus on it while holding your stick at the correct position. Although hand-eye coordination is mainly taught through the powers of the computer. To conclude, all that I would like to say is that the computer is a great source for intellegence. It also allows you to keep in touch with high school friends and far away family. Finally, the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer is a very important piece of technology.",4,4,0

451,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I believe that people should be able to go on the computers and still be doing it. For a good reason such as communicating with far away relatives. Another reason is, if you need a @ORGANIZATION1 work-out or healthy eating tips, you can just print them out. And my last reason is if you're going on a far away trip but you don't know the way, you can just print out directions (@ORGANIZATION2). Say if you have a relative that lives all the way in @CAPS1 but you can't call them because you live all the way in the @LOCATION1 And if you call them, it'll cost you about @MONEY1 per minute. What you can do is you can contact them over the computer (webcam). And it's way better than just calling them because you can actually see them. Or if your on a business trip away from home, you can check upon your family. My second reason is, you can stay fit while being on the computer. You can look up @ORGANIZATION1 ""yoga"" poses. Or you can also do fitness lessons while watching them off of your computer. And if you're on a diet, you can look up @ORGANIZATION1 healthy recipes. You can also get @ORGANIZATION1 work-out equipment that'll make (or keep you), nice and slim. My last reason is that if you're going on a long journey away from home you need to now the way. But, what if you don't know the way? You can go on the internet and look up directions. And that is way better because at least you arent wasting money on a @MONEY2 @ORGANIZATION3. And it is more and quicker. And the best part is that you don't have to keep looking at the @ORGANIZATION3 and program stuff. With the maps on the computer, you can print it out and actually keep it. Those are all my reasons to why people should really go on computers. There are many things that a computer can do which is really good. You can communicate with relatives, stay fit/healthy while on the computer and getting maps. I hope that this opens up many peoples eyes. And maybe change a couple scientist's mind.",4,4,0

""I'm sorry @PERSON2, my computer crashed."" @CAPS6 it @CAPS2, you have realized that computers do benefit people. Whether its doing a class project, practicing for a computers class or exchanging buisness ideas, computers are a big help to society. First of all computers are a big help when it comes to a computer class at your school. There might be a certain speed that a person types and to pass the class, and the teacher could assign practice on your own home computer. It is a fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have some kind of personal ocmputer at home get @CAPS7 A's in their computer class. I can back that up as well. In my computers class. our teacher stresses the importance of practicing at home to get your typing speed a little higher. Every @TIME1 I would practice but one @TIME1 my computer crashed, and I could not practice for the whole work with my luch the final exam @CAPS2 on @DATE1 instead of getting a @CAPS8 or A, I got a @CAPS9+. I blame that grade on not having a computer at home. Secondly, computer can be used for learning @MONTH1 different things as well. Maybe on a class report you needed to write something about the traditons of @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1. Instead of running over to the library and wasting your time with a book. You could just open up your laptop and look it up on the internet. Not only does it make for less time, but @CAPS6 you look it up on the internet, you will get way more search results than @CAPS6 you search on a library derectory. In addition, by using computers, you can look up the cutomers of a foreign country, or look up programs than could help you learn a new language on computers, you can not only learn about your own country but you can learn about foreign ones. Thirdly, computers can enchance many skills that are needed in the modern buisness word, such as socialization skills communication skills, and even learning about the younger generation. @CAPS6 someone had not gone on an instant messaging program or a video chatting program. They would not make it in the world of today. The people need to learn to intract with each others, and solve problems. @CAPS6 someone is not used intracting with people, they @MONTH1 not make a good buisness man or woman. People must be able to communicate as well @CAPS6 people do not communicate with each other. We will all end up dies in the headlights. We will al be lost and will be able to run buisnesses, or hold meetings, for example I needed to plan at adore for my project group to work on a project, and so I went on my computer hoping they were online basically they never showed and so I could not work with my partners at all. I ended up doing all their work.

1572,"Dear to @CAPS1 this @MONTH1 concern, Computers do a whole lot now of days. You can play games, do homework, socialize but don't you think there are better things than that. Such as exercising, enjoying the beauty of nature, and most importantly interacting with family and friends. These are all the things that computers take away from people. Once you get onto a computer you never want to get off. If you look at it, it doesn't take much work and energy to use a computer. So if you eat and use the computer all day your not really burning any calories therefore you will gain weight. Computers make people feel lazy sometimes therefore they spend less time exercising. That is not good for your health at all. Exercising gives you energy and is good for you. Have you ever looked out the window and saw how beautiful nature is? When your on the computer chit-chatting with people and playing online friends do you think about what your missing. Everytime I use the computer I wish I could be outside playing and enjoying nature. Trees, flowers, plants, grass and lots of other things are what make up the earth, but some people don't apreciate those things. So next time your on the computer think about that. While your on the computer wasting time there is another homeless child wandering maybe looking for their family. Would you like to be that child who doesnt have a family or any type of friends? Lots of people think of their life without a family but it can happen anyday. So I believe instead of wasting time on the computer we should go and interact with family and friends. Even if its just having a conversation do it, maybe it can show them that you really care. In conclusion, I think that computers are a waste of time. I understand how people say it is used to comunicate with people but back then they didnt have computers and they communicated so we can to.

1405,"Dear Local Newspaper, I have herd that some people do not agree that computer benefit our society. Well in this letter I am going to give you three reasons how computers do benefit our society. Those reasons are @NUM1) People have friends and family in other states @NUM2) some people use them to stay organized And @NUM3) Computers help you learn more. I hope that by the end of this letter you will see that computers do benefit our society. First of all, I think that computers benefit our society because @CAPS7 lets people @CAPS3 in contract with family and friends in other states. This is true that you could use the phone and call them out you have to pay for long distance. You don't have to pay anything to email somebody. I know from experience because, I have friends and family in a lot of states in the @LOCATION1 ""@CAPS1 computers help me stay in contact with my family all over"" @PERSON3 ( @ORGANIZATION1 ) @CAPS2 many people use the computer the contact with loved ones everyday. Some people even on them to stay in touch with family or at war. Next I believe that computers benefit society because @CAPS7 keeps people organized. I know this many not seem like a big deal but a lot of people or computers to @CAPS3 things organized @CAPS2 they know how everything is would happen if didn't have computers to @CAPS3 all of the appointment in? Well I will tell you what would happen to @CAPS3 all would end appointment would @CAPS3 giving you things you already got. ""I @CAPS3 @CAPS4 on my computers - @PERSON1 And @CAPS5, I strongly belive that computers benefit our society because they help people learn more. Yes @CAPS7 is right that not everybody goes on the computers to learn but that doesn't mean they don't learn. Here's a cuple examples is @NUM1) @CAPS6 - @CAPS7 lets you learn song lyrics, dance moves and more (@NUM2) @CAPS8 - @CAPS7 lets you learn what other people like, don't like and @CAPS2 on. Then there is face book, @CAPS7 lets you see what people are doing that day. ""People learn everything to the computer"" @CAPS9 @PERSON2. Now I hope you see that computers don't benefit our society than that is your opinion. I hope you see what I see now.",5,4,1
425,"To whom this @MONTH1 concern Computers are a great source of technology, but many people spend to much time on them. People don't get to see the out-side world because they are to ""busy"" on their computers, and use them to find things or play games that they can do just outside in the fresh air. Computers are and people spend to much time on them instead of having an outdoor experience, exercising, and talk and bonding with their family and friends. First of all, people don't enjoy nature as much as they enjoy their computers. When you're stuck in side school or work, you don't get to go outside and see the natural beauty of nature, so when you get out take @NUM1 minutes or so to go and enjoy the wilderness. You don't have to go outside every day, but once in a while it feels good to get out and explore the world. Expecially when you had a little break and what to be alone, in nature, you can get away and lose your stress. Some @MONTH1 say you can enjoy nature and explore new places online, and yes you wouldn't you want to do it first-hand? You don't get the real experience by just looking at pictures. You have to be their and explore it by yourself. In nature there is always some thing new. Secondly, when you are on your computer, you didn't doing anything your body, you need to go exercise. Fresh air is good for you, you. Spending most of your time on your computer, you don't spend time with your family and friends. Family is the most important thing in your life, and as you get older, the time you have with your family get less and less. You also @MONTH1 see you friends in school or at work everyday but you don't really get to sit and ""catch up"" with each other. Online their are programs where you can chat with friends and family, but wouldn't you want to see them personaly, especially if you don't see them everyweek. It's a better experience and you made many more moments. Just going out far which or even going on a run can give you time with your loved ones. In conclusion, people spend to much time on their computers. They don't get to experience the outside world and the wonders of nature. The more on their computers, the less exercise they get and less fresh air. Family and friends some of the greatest things in your life, dont get to bond with you,. Computers are good for using spread sheets and typing essays, but they aren't good for you to spend all your time on, mailing it, and missing out on the adventures your life will venture through",5,5,1
548,"Dear Newspaper, Computers are not something to be afraid of. They help many people in different ways, like the @CAPS1, teachers, students, scientists, and locals dealing with their jobs and daily life. Hasn't a computer already helped you today? Because of that, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future. Who has said that by using computers you dont interact with your family as much? Well, I can tell you that I'm staying in contact with my grandma, cousins, and aunts through my e-mail. With e-mail you can check up on news or simply write to friends and family! Also, if you are planning a trip to visit your loving family members, dont bother with a map that gets in your face all the time and you just ""happen"" to get lost, try going on @ORGANIZATION1 maps and plan the shortest route to your destination without getting lost along the way. Computers can do more than creating a simple map, it can give you precious information! Many schools across the country use computers to help teach kids. The kids can look up @LOCATION1 and in @NUM1 seconds they have all the information they need! In most school paper you have to type and provide what websites you used to achieve finishing the paper. What is also nice is that you dont need to go through huge books for one small piece of information. It is much easier, looking it up on the computer. Speaking of not using big books for imformation computers don't use paper and will lead us to a healthier tomorrow! Millions of toms of paper land in landfills each day! By using computers we could read online and conserve paper! Another fantastic fact is that computers will grow in the future. people have already created touch-screen computers and computers will grow even more! Many people think that using computers is a bad thing, but look at the facts! Doesnt the newspaper write the newspaper on computers? If they didnt, they would be having hand cramps all the time! And what about docters dont they have your medical history on the computer, if not all these papers would get lost! Like in the beginning, computers help us learn, keep in contact with people, and are our future.",4,4,0

Think about it, paper is made out of trees and of coarse to get the paper you must cut down the tree first, and then have it an through a whole wasteful process to get that paper.If everyone used computers we wouldn't have to cut down those beautifully, lush trees. And also, have you ever needed to get information fast? Well instead of going through a book and possibly searching for hours, finding that information on the internet would be so much faster! Lastly, in the future everything will eventually be run with computers, they are the then now and later! They'll never get old! Computers are extremly helpful with endless information. A lot of people @DATE1 are very sensitive about our enviroment and how we're treating the earth. They are looking for new ways to help the world be as green as possible. An easy alternitive for paper is a computer. Once for school i was assigned a paper; i looked up the information on the computer easily, typed it up, and sent it by email to my teacher. Not a single peice of paper had been used! Ok so i know, computers use up a lot of energy, but to be honest they don't have to. Many people around the world use solar panels to gain their energy from the sun to power their lights, computers, etc.! The use of computers is extremely eco friendly and like i said before is a great alternitive to our everyday wasteful use of paper and pencil. Do you want to look up information fast? Well on the computer you can! All you do is type in what you need in a search engine and @CAPS1! you have the info you need! Instead of using a book (which wastes trees) to slowly find your information you can use a simple computer to do the job. A poll was token and shows that @PERCENT1 of students at @CAPS2 @CAPS3 school who use the computer to look up information get faster and more accurate results! Do you want that or slow information found in a boring book? The future is not far away. It is already @DATE2 and we are using the computer for so much. Ok so the computer does show to cause distractions and headaches if used too long, but it is a great invention of the future. Instead of going to a restaurant and ordering off we'll order of computers/touch screans. More and more people are coming up with beter and faster computers. Everyone is using computers and love it and they will difenetly be used in the future. I hope you see how amazing computers can be. They're enviomentaly useful and a great alternitive to paper, they help you find the information you need fast, and proffesor grant states"" i do all my work on the computer, without it i would be lost."" And lastly they are the future of our world! They are the then now and later of the technical world.",6,6,1
1692,"Dear The @CAPS1, People have been saying that computers are not beneficial, but they are wrong. In my opinion computers are very beneficial. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about other people and faraway places, also, you can use the internet to interact with friends and family. Computers can be very useful and efficient to anybody. Did you know that computers can teach hand-eye coordinaiton? Some computers have programs that teach you how to type. Without having to lock down at the keyboard. Even if people don't have the program they can learn how to type fact without having to look down. Many people that I know, have learned how to use the computer or type without anyone telling them hour to do so. Computers are very needed all around the world. Computers give people the ability to learn about other people and places. If you go on the internet you can go and searching person or place and the computer will find it for you. Children and adults need computers because if for example, a child get a project from schoool that need to be done about a famous person or smoking. she would most likely need to go to the internet . The game goes for adults that love jobs in offices, schools or anywhere else. Computers are essential to people all around the world. Computer can be used to comunicate with each other. People use computer to communicate with friends or family in far away places. They can communicate via e-mail, @CAPS2, video and maybe even in other web sites. Some web sites contain the ability to talk to each other through video or through messages, such as @CAPS3, or @CAPS4. People like using the computer because it is very useful when you need it most. If you ask anyone they will tell you that having a computer is very important and necessary. Why would people intend to take away something as important and useful as a computer? Computers can be used to learn hand-eye coordination, and help you move your fingers faster. They give poeple and places in the world. Finally, they can be used to communicate with one another through e-mail, message and many other ways. In my opinion, computers are one of the most important things to a person.",5,4,1
904,"Dear town of southing ton, Computers our town are very important for instance. For all of the banks we have computers and for almost every job. We need computers for life, and that doesn'@CAPS1 make use lazy and forget full it makes us busy. The only situation with someone who is online being lazy is with a teenager playing games. But the only reason some kids do that is because they all dont want to go and exercise or run around with their family who they see everyday. But because they want to talk to their friends make plans and just talk while they play togeather. If someone is ignoring their family or becomeing more lazy, it is because that is their choice to sit around and do nothing. And I do agree that people are becomeing over weight but I think that is because some people consider a workout to be an hour of lifting and running once a week. And that isn'@CAPS1 right. I think that this news paper should post up adds about gyms and maybe that will lower the faty meter in our town. or if they think people are neglecting their families have people work less so they can go home and see their families. As for teens I think you parents out there need to set some rules like @NUM1 hours of play a day, @NUM2 hours on a @DATE1, and if they don'@CAPS1 listen take the game away for a day of two, but that might not get them to spend time with you because they @MONTH1 be mad, but it will get them outside or atleast doing somehting more active and not watching @CAPS1.V. or playing video games all day.

Thos are @CAPS1 reasons as to why I disagree. In this paragraph I am going to tell you about why I think that people should @CAPS4 other things than going on the computer all night. If they wake up in the morning and start being grumpy dont blame them the computer had them stay up late. Would you rather get a good nights rest or be extra tired in the morning because you stayed up too late on the computer?

(@CAPS3 the parents) @CAPS4 you realy want your kids to be lazy and on the computer all days or @CAPS4 you want your kids to excersize and get healthier? @CAPS1 friends kids always are on the computer everyday all the time and thats not verry healthy @CAPS3 them especialy because they're young.

677,"Dear @LOCATION1 press, I believe that computers have a terrible impact on society, the reason I believe this is true is that kids can go ""braindead"" as some people call it. Also kids can get obese witch is already a greatly growing process. The last reason is that kids get bad eye sight from it. The first reason I believe that computers have a bad impact on our society is that all kids do is sit there and eat while they are on the computer and they get an addiction to it so they just keep getting fatter because they arn't getting any exercise. This problem with children getting fat is already a very brought up topic and with something like this out it's not going to get any better any time soon. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kids who are on the computer more than a hour and a half a day are actually going braindead. This means that if this becomes the new trend for all kids that our next generation will not be smart and won't be able to keep up with other countries and fall behind, so we have to do something about this trend setting issue if you want our country to stay in one piece. The last but not least reason is kids are forming a bad eye sight. This can also bad for future generations. If you let this catch on the generation will all need glasses its almost like a domino effect. These are all the reasons that computers have a bad impact on the society. kids get obese, they go braindead, and they develop bad eye sight from it.",4,4,0

I do not agree with the fact that computers are a good part of society. Although you do need computers. There are some reasons to which I am saying this. Typing s faster than hand writing and its neater. With all the different websites, you can advertise and buy important thing bat the internet and talk to people froma round the world. With all of these good reasons there should be an instant choice of it they're good or bad. But there is a main reason. It's areason that tells it is bad. Computers are for people. People had can't get off their write a hand written report or drive to the store to buy something. Not it. If computers never exiled, the world would no doubt be better all around place. There a lot of reason in which computers are bad. They hold information which can be hacked and by somebody thay you don't want to know something. Cyber bullying is a bad thing about computer. Another big is those stupid online games. People get addicted then they become lazy and eventually obese. So as I said before, part of society and should be. This would be of good importance to me if you took my letter into.

423,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people in our community use computers for positive ideas. Such as if gives you hadn and eye coordination, gives people the ability to research on far away places and allows you to talk to far away family. This is why I think computers have a positive effect on people. To begin with computers give a positive efect on people because it gives you hand and eye cordination. For example that can help you to have ability to do more. Like work somewhere such as a restraunt. This needs lots of cordination for holding heavy trays. My mom is a waitress and she needs a lot of cordination she tells me. Another reason would be you would have more hand cordination driving because you can react fast. Some people say that computers make you not be able to see while. Which than you would need glasses. But thats there desision this can give you one reason that computers are a positive effect on people today. Secondly why computers are a positive effect because it gives people the ability to search far away places. Why this can be a good thing is because you can get a good idea of what its like and might want to take a trip there. Another reason would be that students usually have projects which call for research in other countries. Computers make kids smarter that way but some people say that kids could get on a website where it can be bad, which also they arn't getting exersize if all there doing is researching when they can do that in the own town. But about @PERCENT1 of kids can stil be on the computer than go and get exersize. This is another reason computers are an impact. Lastly, why computers are positive is kids and adults can talk to there friends or family quicker. For exmaple if a family member lives far away instead of mail you can send it on the computer in a @NUM1 minute send. Its quicker and easier. Another reason is your kids will be able to talk to there friends faster than mail as well. About @PERCENT2 of kids use computers to talk to there friends But some people say kids can think there talking to there friends but could be someone bad. But to make sure all your friends should have one question to make sure its there friend. This is why to computers are a positive impact on young adults, and children, parents. To conclude, I would like to say that computers are a positive impact for a couple reasons one it gives you more hand and eye coordination gives people the ability to search other countries and beable to talk to friends. Others disagree because it can ruin your eyes, not get exersize and lastly give your child unsafe. But that can be changed easily by limiting kids, see who they talk to and get them in a sport. This is why I think computers are a postive impact.",4,5,0

Lastly, computers have a negative effect on people because it takes away from people using their world. When you're on the computer, it seems like the entire world is in your computer screen. But its not. This is effecting people negatively. @PERCENT1 of people who use computers on the stocking average of about @NUM2 hours a day have notedly become withdrawn and unaware of their world says my physcology.net.

It especially will effect children, the next generation, who will have no knowledge or a clear view on the world if people keep up their negative habits: computer usage. In conclusion, computers have negative effects on people. They diminish @CAPS3, so bad @ORGANIZATION1 increases and the need for @CAPS3 increases. It cuts family interaction by destroying family relationships and bonds, not to mention communication. Finally, it takes away from people seeing the world, something actually very important because it affects people's desicion making as well as future generations.

1106,"Dear @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS2 you know that eight out of ten homes in @LOCATION1 have at least one computer if not more? Computers help us with daily things and make many tasks, like writing an essay, much easier. They benefit our society in many ways. Without computers some families would lose contact with loved ones who are far away, not to mention it can keep many things very organized and neat easily. Maybe the best benifit is how you can learn about far away countries and cultures with the click of a button. Computers have endless posibilities to how they can benifit our society. Many people don't realize that some families can not be with eachother so easily as other. If a family member is in the service somtimes talking on the computer is the only chance they get to commnunicate with their loved ones back home. Saying that this is not a benifit is a lie. For others who don't have such sevier need of communicating it is still a convinient way to have a conversation with someone far away without racking up the phone bill for a long distance call. Also many times this can be an altenative to parents buying their children expensive cell phones. So having a computer is defanitly a benifit to communiting. The computer can also make many tasks much esier, for example if you were assiangned a @NUM1 pages essay in school typing it on the computer would be much neater and quicker than writing it all out. Also many buisnesses relay on computers to keep data organized and all in place. Like the program excel, @ORGANIZATION2 created this to make a simple way to organize data. It is much more efficient than than having every thing in different site with millions of texters in every draw. So another benifit of the computer is that it can keep tthings organized and poride easy ways to complete evey day tasks. Maybe the greatest benifit of the computer is how much you can learn so easily. Say I was curiouse about the recent earthquake in @LOCATION2, if I wanted more inofrmartion @CAPS3 head straight to the computer. You simply go to @ORGANIZATION3 or another search engine of your choice, type in the subject, one click, and bam you could read for hours all of the websites and articles that would come up. The computer is full of information, and is right at our finger tips, this is definitly a huge benifit to our socierty. The computer is a wonderful tool that can asist in so many ways, wether it is communication organization, or just curiosity. This advance in technology is just another way to improve every day life.

It will also help us learn about new things because we can talk to people and they could give us some ideas on what to learn about. This will help us all because we want to learn about new things, talk to new people and see new places. this is a good idea for all of us. We can all benifit from this because it's good thing for everyone to have. I think we should have computers because it would help us meet new people, seeing new places, and learn new things.

Your family can sey time limits on the computer if they think your. Spending to much time on it. If you have time limits then people will have a certin time they go on and off of the computer. For example a child is on the computer @NUM1 and you can't get them off, time limits will stop that. The child is on a game and if the time limits are on, when your time is done the computer logs off automaticaly. That way your child can't get back on till thier next time. The computer can do many things you can play online games and chat with friends. Chating will let you talk to friends over the computer and you won't need to call them. Online games will still let you talk to your friends but you can have an avatar you can dress up and be creative with. For example an online game can let you chat make friends,",3,4,0

Like if you have to do a paper on the other side of the world a computer is up to date unlike a book so computer have a good effect on school kids and work so computer are good but other then that most people send all day talking to people on theme and don't go out side and get fresh air so computer have bad effects on some people and have good effects they all need for work and stoff so I think that most people use computer to much to talk to people and for gaming. But some people don't go on it for a long time and go out side and use a computer if they have to for work so the effects of computers is that to meny people use theme forever and talk to people and site and get fat from not going out side and playing and geting fresh aire so most people over use there computer on facebook and stof like that were they code go out side and site on a swing and txt and get fresh aire.,3,3,0
593,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers take away from our lives in a negative way. New advancements in technology in general take away from our lives negatively. It can contribute to obesity, turn you into a couch potato, and can take away from your social life. It's not that computers arent useful, it's that people are using them too frequently. As a country, @LOCATION1 has more obese people each decade. A good way to lessen the obese population, is to get them out of that comouter chair. @CAPS5 all you do is sit on a chair and play flash games and watch youtube videos all day, your sure to put on a few pounds, Those few pounds do accumulate. @CAPS6 fast food companies like @ORGANIZATION1 contribute to obesity, so do computers. When someone eats a big mac burger, should they go upstairs to play a flash game, or go work out at the gym? Trust me, you arent going to burn any calories by clicking a mouse. People who often use the computer, rarely see the true beuty of nature. They are too busy shooting animated rabbits to go see real rabits. Would you rather take a walkin the park, or stare at a computer screen for @DATE1 and a half hours? The world is a beutiful place, and the more you @CAPS2 @CAPS3, the less you realize it. Being on the computer can even effect your social life. The more you socialize to people you don'@CAPS4 know on the computer, the less you know how to communicate to real people I know that I would want a real girlfriend, not a virtual one. You @MONTH1 be too into a @CAPS4.V. show that your watching on the computer, to even spend time with loved ones. Your family is much more important than a silly computer game. In conclusion, I'd like to say that (in my opinion) computers should be used a little less. Who wouldn'@CAPS4 want to be a fit, nature love, popular kid @CAPS5 people would just spend a little less time on the computer, and a little more time in reality, You could be a kid like that.

1585,"Do the members of this well-known and captivating newspaper think that the effects of people owning a computer are good or bad? Well, if you think negatively about computers and how they effect people, I would like to politely disagree. I'm certain I could sway you to agree with me too. Computers are positive for many reasons. The internet and other resources can be used for school, work, and other questions, the computer gives people something to do when otherwise they have nothing, and it allows people to talk to others online. There are many great effects computers have on and for people. Everybody has questions, wouldn't you agree? And more often than not, people don't know the answer right off the top of their head. Research is the key to answering questions. But who has time to go to the library and spend hours searching for an answer that would take a matter of seconds to find on the computer? Not every student, employee, or other person can spend that time looking for an answer. There are far too many other things to do! The internet on the computer allows people to find an answer quickly. This can actually improve people's knowledge, and their performance at work or school. You can see here the positive effects of a computer. Have any of you ever been bored? I'm certain that you have. Everyone gets bored. Instead of sitting around doing nothing, people can go on the computer and to many activities. Contrary to some people's beliefs, this can be an excellent way to spend, not waste time. There are all sorts of educational games and mind-buggling puzzles to do on the computer. I'm certain you can see how much better these things are than sitting in front of the. The effects are positive, because your brain is challenged, and your boredom has vanished. Also, hand-eye coordination can be greatly improved by doing activities. These are so many positivities about the computers effect in people's boredom! People have friends, and it is only human to want to keep in close contact with them. But what if a close friend moves away? You don't want to lose that friendship right? People can write letters to each other, but that can be time consuming, and show to delivery and response. And the positive effect of a computer is it allows you to keep in contact online with friends and family instant messaging and email. both great resources for talking with others. Computers can keep friends together and save families from drifting apart. It is also good for couples or parents to keep in touch with their partner or children if they are away. These are all positive effects don't you agree? As you can see, I feel strongly that the computer has positive effects on people. It's good for research, it's something to do when someone is truly bored, and it enables friends and family to stay close via online communication. I strongly urge you to change your opinion from negative to positive about the effects of computers. Everyone can choose their own opinions. but I know you'll prove wise and agree with me!",4,5,0
305,"Computers, a very much talked about subject. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of homes in @LOCATION1 own at least one computer. And that goes for about @PERCENT2 in @LOCATION2. Some people don't like that this is true, but on the other hand some people do. I have a computer, it can do so much, for example it can help me with writing, I can play games on it and socialize with social networking sites and ""I.M.'s"", it can even help me order a product form a website like @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION3, or @LOCATION4. Like I said, I have a computer and I can use it to help me write. At school in english, I would use my computer to help me with a writing prompt. I also use it to write conclusions for science labs. There are a lot of other kids that do this as well, it really is very helpful. That is only one of the reasons I think computers are beneficial to society. Another reason I think computers are beneficial to society is because you can play games on them, like ""world of warcraft"", ""@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1"", or classics like ""@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5"". There are millions of people that play games on the computer. Also you can socialize with social networking sites, like @CAPS6 and twitter, and also because you can ""I.M."" your friends. I.M. stands for @CAPS7 messaging, and it is kind of like email except it is just about instantaneous, and so you and friend can have a conversation over the computer. Also there is video chatting, where it is kind of like a phone except you can see the person you're talking to and it is over the computer, so it is almost like you and the person you are videochatting with are meeting face to face, but your not. A third reason I feel that computers are beneficial to society is because you can order a product over the internet form shop websites. For example, I got my @CAPS8 from @LOCATION3, and also the bulb for a @CAPS9 in my house is wearing out, so my dad is going to buy a @LOCATION1 bulb on @ORGANIZATION1. It is things like this that make life that much easier for the @CAPS10 @PERSON1, because this way these people don't have to drive to the store to buy something, that is, if they can wait a week or two for the product to arrive. These are the kinds of things that make me feel that computers are beneficial to society. I know they might not be the best reasons, but they are quite important to me. Being able to type essays, play games and socialize, and order products form websites is just amazing. These are some of the reasons that I and others love computers. But I have a question for you, why do you like or dislike computers?",5,5,1
1744,"Dear Local newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer at home you enjoy? Computers are a big thing now in life, they help with many things. Such as staying organized, studies, and even entertainment. These are the three topics I will focus on, because I @CAPS1 believe that computers are useful and people use them a help to make life a lot more easy. Let me start by saying: ""I am a man who enjoys computers, as a way to talk to friends, listen and search music, watch videos on youtube, get school work done, and much more! Although, on main point is it helps me stay orginized. I can make many folders to store my work in, rather then losing or spilling something on the paper if I wrote it out. I can have my music, homework, projects, does work, videos, pictures, and much more saved and orginized so I know where it is everytime I go to find it. There can be no more, ""my dog ate my homework"" excuse. Moving on to the next topic. As I mentioned you can save work onto your computer, you can add without earasing as well, the work becomes neat and perfect everytime. So when you teacher is grading on neatness no worry. You can also look up information on any topic you are working on in class witch alows you to get. More information, the better the grade. Spelling is not a factor now, because your computer tells you when a word is spelt wrong. It even gives you suggestions on how to spell the word by underlining it with a red squigle line. This really helps because a lot of people have hard times with spelling. You can even get @CAPS2 to play a book you are reading, witch helps you learn new words that you @MONTH1 not have knew how to sound out. Teachers can even post notes on school websites of homework, when projects are @CAPS1, ext. No more, ""I didn't know/remember what was homework/project due. Lastly, entertainment is the biggest thing with computers. People go on every day uploading videos, pictures, blogs, and just about what ever they want. Games are played on computers by younger kids, just learning, while older kids are enjoying playing maze, driving, shooting, adventure, and much more types of games. Just about everyone using a computer knows of some chat website in witch they use to communicate with any one. Myspace, facebook, twitter, and so much more are used by people to talk, express how they feel to everyone/to just let it out), show love to someone, send birthday wishes, to @CAPS1 what ever. Those are endless possibilities at entertainment on a computer. Without a dobt, no more, ""I'm bored"". @CAPS1 you use your computer to @CAPS1 anything like this? If so you must enjoy it. People use computer for every thing from work to expressing feelings. Now what side are you at?",5,6,1

1750,"Dear Local Newspaper, People all around the globe are using computers! Some people think this is a bad idea but I disagree. I believe that computers do have a positive effect on a persons life style. Computers help people stay in touch, computers are only getting better and they help kids in many ways. Computers definitly help people keep in touch. There is @CAPS1, myspace, twitter, facebook, email, and even video chat. For example, my cousin is in @LOCATION1 a sometimes we will go on the computer and talk to on video chat. Without this, we would have no communication with him. Many people around the world use computers to communicate. This is how people use computers to stay in touch. Also, computers are amazing now and they're only going to get better. If computers are so great now, just imagine what they will be like in @NUM1 or @NUM2 years. Plus, the more people buy and use computers the more company are going to want to invent new ones. As you can see computers are only going to get better. The last reason I would like to share with you today is that computers help kids tromendously. On average, about @PERCENT1 of kid in the @CAPS2.S use a computer every day. Kids use it to talk to friends, play games, do homework and to do many other things as well.

If you love computers so much that you stay up all night and don't get any sleep then you miss work and you get tired then you know you have a problem so quit. You dont want to stay up al night.

1114,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am here to prosoade you to agree with me on, that the use of computers does benift society. Some reasons why I think this are school work and business stuff. Also the over all reasearch on important things. My first reason why I think that computer use is benifiting society is because @CAPS6 is oftenly used for school work. In example use @CAPS6 for projects. Also some type of reasearch they might be interested in. But one of the most important reasons why computers use is so high is because, there are a lot of people taking online classes. Wheather its for college or for the sake of your own learning. This is why I think school work shoud be a valid reason for benifiting society. My second reason why I think @CAPS6 benifits our society is the business or job part of the computer. Many people, @CAPS7 a days work at home, they have their own office. They all most create their own company. Another reason is many people also use ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" or publisher. @PERCENT1 of the people who work at public businesses do this, going along with ads, when could also or another reason for this. But then again, you could @CAPS7 pay your bills on line! I remember when I helped my mother pay on of the bills online, and let me tell you, ""@CAPS6 was easy!"". My mother said she do @CAPS6 more often @CAPS7 that she knows how to use @CAPS6!"" @CAPS7 the business side should be more then enough, for me to convince you. My last reason is over all reasearch on all important things. Some of these important things are: online catalogs, the news and another one the most important things of all job openings. I know my self, and I love to shop! So instead of leaving the house, I just go on the online catalog to my favorite store called ""@CAPS8"". The main reasons why I go online is b/c they have more variety and sizes. @CAPS7 for the news, thats all for my parents b/c i don't watch the news. Lastly, job openings @CAPS7 that I am @NUM1, I would like to find a job, even if its mimumum wage. @CAPS6's still something, right? This should be a high priced reason for agreement!

637,"Dear, To who it @MONTH1 concer, I am writing this to inform about how the ocmputers benefits society. I think computers aren't that great because people use certain websites. People use @CAPS1 messaging and its also a way getting connected to others. I also think that some people ae addicted because you can search someone or @CAPS5. You find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users who use the computers. Some computers are bad education to some kids who are trying to learn majority of kids use computers for internet access most kids will be on the computer playing games that @MONTH1 not be suitable for the age group. My first reason is when people get on the computer they find websites that others use. For example: @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, ect. Many people use websites to check the emails. For exmaple: @ORGANIZATION2, @LOCATION1L, @CAPS4.mail, ect. My other reason to you why people use websites is for @CAPS1 messaging. People sue @CAPS1 messaging to connect with their friends, family, & other people they @MONTH1 not know. People say its a faster connection to people @MONTH1 not could reach. For example: person doesn't have a phone, the person does not live close by & the person lives in another town. I also think it good research to browse people. For example you know someone but you can't find you can browse. Another second one is people maybe addicted. For example: they go on website & they go on it over & over & over again. they don't stop using it until it gone. In additional people think it keeps them busy. For example you don't have anything to do go on the computer. Lastly you find top websites that maybe inapropriate for users. For example, you find a website but its not suitable for minor. Only @CAPS5 adults could watch. One more thing computers aren't bad education. For example you can learn from apropriate websites that builds brain muscles. My opinion is that I do think computers benift the society because it mainly helps you brain storm & you get to know websites & learn about them.",4,4,0

1236,"In my own opinion, computers are great addition to our world. Computers can help people with schoolwork, communication and entertain you in a safe way. Those are the reasons why computers have effects on people around the world. First of all, computers help with a child's schoolwork. For instance, if a student is doing a research paper, the world-wide-web is a helpful place to easily get information from that you can't find in books. In addition if a student forgets, losses, or is missing homework, they can log on the school website and print the paper out. Also, most teachers expect an essay to be @CAPS1 neat @CAPS1 possible. That is hard for some students,  typing it is neat, and everyone can do it. @CAPS1 you can see, computers are very much needed when it comes to school work. Second, computers are a great way to communicate and keep-in-touch with other people. For example, if an employee wanted to speak with a boss, or send some thing to him, he could easily e-mail it to him. Also, if friends wanted to talk with one another, the could instant message each other. If a teacher and a parent of a student had to set up an conference, the teacher could e-mail the parent a time and date. That is why computers are great can easy communication. Lastley, computers provide a safe, fun way or entertainment. Many companies make kid-friendly websites that  go on. For instance, my six year old sister goes on a website that teaches you things in a fun way. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of kindergardeners who go on these websites, do better in first grade compared to those who don't computers are a great way to spend your time. In conclusion, I believe that computers have a great effect on people around the planet. They help with school work, provide east communication, and provide safe educational activities, @CAPS1 you can see, computers are a great addition to our world.",5,5,1
1363,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 has come to @CAPS2 attention that we are debating on weather or not computers benefit society. Well if you ask me, I think @CAPS1 does. For one computers help with entertainment. Second of all, they're very information. Lastly, computers make life less stressful. In the following paragraphs I will explain on @CAPS2 reasoning. Firstly, computers give entertainment. Now I can see why people say we should go out side more and excersize but, what are supposed to do on a rainy day? Well, you could go on the computer! Plus, computers give children enjoyment and make them happy, instead of being sometimes. Another reason why computers are good, is they can give children modivation. Say you're child really wants to play a new game on his favorite website, but his homework isnt done you could tell him if he gets his homework done he can play on the computer. Also, you could give him a time limit on @CAPS1 too. Lastly, for a teenager or older they are more social than little children. They go on things like ; twitter, facebook and myspace. Computers is probably their @NUM1 or @NUM2 way they communicate. Unfortuneatley. Some people abuse these rights and people get in trouble. But the good thing is you can customize you page so that won't happen. Any way children become more social. Secondly, computers are informational. They can tell you a lot by just the touch of keypad and the click of a mouse. You can search someone or something across the whole world. If you want to know the mother and how to prepare for @CAPS1, just look @CAPS1 up and do what you have to. Also, if you find out something new tell people, you can spread the knowledge. Thirdly, computers make things less stressfull. which would you rather do, type or @NUM3 pages? Well I'd type! computers make things more organized so @CAPS1's easier to find things. @CAPS1 also makes @CAPS1 easier to find things, like files because you can just do to ""@CAPS2 documents"" and find @CAPS1. As you can set computers are an important part our lives. Can you imagine a world without computers? I sure couldn't! So far i've said computers are entertaining, informational and make things less stressful. I hope you take @CAPS2 letter into concideration.",4,4,0

According to a survey done by the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 only @PERCENT1 of computer users reported that they exercised at least once every week. In contrast, @PERCENT2 of non-computer users (non-frequent computer users) reported that they exrcised at least once every week. Can one imagine what it would be like if everyone was a loyal computer user? Nearly everybody would be overweight, lethaigic from lack of sleep due to hours on the computer, and unworldly. Getting exercise is an essential part of everyone's life, and lacking it could be deleterious to one's health. Hopping off the computer and instead getting exercise, would make for a healthier and more fit country. Not only do computers deprive people of getting exercise, but they also prevent people from enjoying nature and other parts of the world. By traveling to @CAPS1 and unfamiliar places in the world, one is able to experience and learn about other cultures. Going on the internet @MONTH1 be a decent way to learn about other places, but actually feeling the ambiance and environment of a foreign place is allows for a much more profound understanding of another place. For example. when I went to @LOCATION2 for a vacation, I learned about the differences in traditions and culture. I saw the separation between the poor and the rich when I lookes from humble sharks along the river to the portentous, eregant edifices scraping the sky. It was an experince I could not encounter on a computer. People should be able to enjoy the wonders and differences of the world not on a small screen of a computer, but through the screen of one's eyes. Lastly, computers inhibit people from interacting with family and friends. From my personal experiences, I tend to ignore friends and family. Speaking, playing, and generally socializing with others is a critical part of everyone's life. Without this basic necessity people cannot be happy. In summary, computers should not be used in excess. This sort of use could read to people getting less exercise, not fully experiencing the world, and closs of interaction with friends and family. To make a better country and nation, the people of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 should make an effort to reduce computer use.",6,6,1
496,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you like it if your children stay on the computer all the time? I wouldn't children or even adults won't spend time with family, kids will be unhealthy, and lastly they can get addicted to using the computer and computer language. Please keep reading to hear my ideas. To begin with, children or even adults won't spend as much time with their family. For example @PERCENT2 of people will stay on the computer all day and won't even worry about their kids. i remember when I read on facebook that the guy was so into a game he was playing that he didn't answer the phone when they tould him his son got hit by a car. Now, news lpaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you wan't your son going through what that man's son went through? I don't think so. Also, kids or adults will be unhealthy and not exercise.

He weighs @NUM1 pounds due to being on the computer all the time. So tell me, newspaper @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you want your kids to be abease. Lastly, now-a-days kids are ""obsessed"" with the computer an computer. @PERCENT1 of people who use the computer use the computer language in school. And out of that @PERCENT1 put internet on their phone so they can go on myspace, facebook, ect. Now, newpaper @CAPS1, what @CAPS2 happen if you wrote computer language in your article woudn't you get fired?

Second, it allows people to communicate with their friends, @CAPS1, it helps with schoolwork and makes things much easier. These are only a few of the reasons why computers do good in our society. @ORGANIZATION2 off, I'd like to say that after a long day of work, all you want to do is relax. Television gets boring and you just want to sit and play games on the computer. Well, thats a great way of winding down on a rough day. You can go on @CAPS2 and watch funny videos or go on @CAPS3 and on you friends new photo album. Your @ORGANIZATION3 computer is to do many things.

A lot of teenagers and adults have @CAPS3 because it gets. So @CAPS4 that you can't get off it. As you get older, you dont talk to your friends that much and soon you don't have many friends at all. @CAPS3 prevents that so you can always talk to them. You should always keep in touch with friends. Most importantly, you use the computer for school work. Without it you can't get picture off @ORGANIZATION1 or type an essay that due. @CAPS8, you can't search words on @LOCATION1. Some teachers require you to type out essays and other don't. You need a computer if your teacher require you to type things. I go on swifts website to see if i have homework dure and that helps me out a teachers @CAPS8 put extra credit online. All in all computes are good for society. @ORGANIZATION2, you can just calm down and relax. Second, you can talk to old friends and keep in touch with new ones. @CAPS1 and most importantly, it's very useful when it comes to schoolwork and up pictures/ .

778,"Dear Local Newspaper, I don't know if I am understanding correctly but are you honestly thinking about not advancing technology? Quickly rethink that because that @MONTH1 just be the worst mistake you could ever make computers can tech hand-ey coordination, they can also give you very useful knowledge. Lastly, computers help us stay close to our family and friends. Fisrt off, about @PERCENT1 of people say that they use the computer every day so that they can increase their knowledge. This could ba as simple as going on @ORGANIZATION1! and discovering the latest news. This is ten times easier that going on the @CAPS1 and waiting for the news stone you want details on. I took a survey and @NUM1 students say that they use thier computer every night so that they can read more into thier social studies or science unit, @CAPS2 computer advances away is like @CAPS2 learning advances away, now is that what you want? Second, @PERSON1, chrildrens doctor states, ""Computers give children that hand-eye coordination they need to enhance in sports"" I agree! Sports such as baseball, soccser, and basketball all need a great deal of hand-eye coordination. Without the hand-eye coordination, students will not do well and end up quiting. I know that if I was having trouble with sports for a long time, I would give up! If the teens gave up sports then they would't have anyining to keep them fit one! that would lead to hundred of kids with on obesity problem. Lastly, @CAPS2 away the advancing in computers maens that you are @CAPS2 away family and friends connectionds. Computers offer many sites such as facebook or myspace o connect with loved ones. You can also go on @CAPS3 or sype to chat or video chat with them. Yes, maybe computers are @CAPS2 away time with family but what about @CAPS4 or @CAPS5 in @LOCATION1 that you have at to in over a year? Don't you want some time them too? You can make time limts for yourself so that you don't spend your whole time on the computer. This way you can took to all of your loved ones would you want to be the one crushing the oceans of a child that wants to talk/ see his grandparents? In conclusion, I remember talking and laughing with my friends over the computer when @CAPS6 sick so that @CAPS7 could cheer me up. Dont take that away from me!

1334,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an amazing piece of technology, but some people are beginning to abuse the @CAPS2. There are many benefits to having a computer.

The @CAPS2 is a very fun thing to be on but when your on it for too long, you miss out on family acvivitys, hanging out with friends etc. I think that there should be a time limit for everyone on the computer. If we had something that would shut off othe computer but save everything you were doing, People would go out more and be more active. Eventhough people @MONTH1 be learning about things on the computer, you have to know when to get off. Now on the @CAPS2 there are websites where you can watch exercize videos or if you even want to buy some exercize equiptment etc. The @CAPS2 can be a pretty handy thing but you dont want to be on it for long periods of time.

Now, one thing I love about computers is now easily you can interact with people whether they're miles away or right in your neighborhood, you could chat with them in the push of a button. For instance, my friends all have the infamous? Facebook account. All I have to do is go online, click my chat box and click their name and then @CAPS5! were talking. And the better part is you @CAPS3't have to share any personal details ( @CAPS6 @CAPS7, phone number etc..) to chat on facebook. Wow wasn''t that easy? Did you ever turned on your @CAPS8. scanned through channels and say ""@CAPS9 goods on @CAPS8?"" @CAPS11, with a computer. theres always something to watch. Whethe @CAPS4 old a new, fake a real, live or not, the computer has many things tool/ watch. You could pull up your @CAPS12 browser and go on @CAPS13 (A video site) and watch their wonderful variety of filling. There are atleast @NUM1 million videos on @CAPS13 and @NUM2 being watched/uploded per day. Infact the ""@CAPS14"" views @NUM3+ video a day without noticing @CAPS4. If your looking for stand up, you could type in ""@CAPS15 @CAPS16! If you're looking to action, you type in chan . Basically, the computer and the bad wide web things to do. Now, @CAPS17 stating those two things, @CAPS4 has come to my attention that the computer is also extremely helpful. Say if you have an extremely big test/report due tomorrow, you can study for @CAPS4 online. You can go on google and type in your projects subject and get over @NUM4 results in a fraction of a second depending on your bandwidth. Now, the computer is also profitable. Did you know the two people who made google are dirt rich? They made more than the @ORGANIZATION1 and the company @ORGANIZATION1 makes the mostly used computer system.

1442,"I think @CAPS1's should use computer's so they can help their self's by using a computer? First @CAPS1's should use computers because if they wanted to take notes on what their doing they can just go on the computer and write it. The Computers are faster than just writing. On a computer all you have to do is type. You can use a computer to look up what ever you want to look for example: the teacher ask to look up a giraffe. The only place you can find a giraffe is if you go on the computer and search a giraffe. That's a reason how to look up things it is easier to look up things instead of looking it up the most way. Lastely, if you have a project you have to and it involves pictures and you dont know how to find it all you just to do is go on the computer find what you searching for and then we are done after you found everything that you see @CAPS2 to let students use computers insde classroom/schools for the they can get easy help.",3,3,0

Many kids would rather chat on facebook with a friend than @CAPS2 homework using an online book... including me. When I get home, I start using the online text book for my math class. But when I wait for it to load I get bored and go on online game website. After that I get too distracted on this addicting game called ""@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1.""

My parents also notice that me and my brother are grumpy after playing on the computer for so long. And I've been stressed lately. Overall, computers have a bad effect on people.

I mean why aren't they you can one learn up on your knowledge, two you can play alot of fun games, and last but not least we can talk to our friend. Well I hope you enjoy my essay about the computer world. Have you ever had any diffuclty finding something in a libery? Well forget your libery cards just go on the computer's @CAPS2. On there you can fin what ever your looking for. One time I was doing a project on my favorite rocker @ORGANIZATION1, so my mom told me to check the libery for a book on him but I couldn't find one. So instead I just jumped on my computer but not really jump on @CAPS4 but any way so I went on the @CAPS2 and guess what! I found all I needed to know about him getting me that rocking at on my project. i mean ther's alot more you can learn with the computer like what's going on in the world around us or even learn about little world around us or even learn about little insects to big plants. Well that's what I got for using the @CAPS2 for knowledge. Welcome back! Well now I'm going to tell you about a few games you can play on the computer. The game I'm going to tell you about is my favorite game and @CAPS4's called left @NUM1 dead @NUM2; @CAPS5 you never played the game your probably like that game sound really hard and scary well @CAPS4 is. i'm just kidding @CAPS4 can be hard at first and a little scary but @CAPS4's still fun. Another game I enjoy playing is a online game called, '@PERSON1,"" the game is fun and all but @CAPS4 takes a while to do and kill the fun stuff. For example I'm a lvl. @NUM3 mage and I can take on lvl. @NUM4 @CAPS7 because I can use high leveled spells. but anyways there alot of things to do on a computer. Like me you can kill zombie hared or just do a quest or two, who cares @CAPS4's in you hands have fun. Now the last thing I'm going to tell you about is how you can talk to you friends over the @CAPS2. well like me I moved so I couldn't really hangout with my friends so I got there @CAPS9-mail so now I can talk and see my friends on a webcam. Another good reason to be able to use the @CAPS10 or computer is you can talk to family members who joined the @ORGANIZATION2. My uncle joined the @ORGANIZATION2 and he's going to be leaving soon so I'm to be wanting to see him so I'll see him on webcam or be able to chat with him.

The @ORGANIZATION2 stated that ""a near @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 students learn something new from a computer that they did not already know."" @CAPS1, in @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 a student could find more information on a specific country than they could with a book.

Next, the computer can help with hand-eye coordination for young kids. In school students are observed to see how well or if there coordination is being developed. With @PERCENT3 @ORGANIZATION2 students having very little coordination, computer games lowered the @PERCENT3 to @PERCENT5. The computer does help with the educational needs @ORGANIZATION2 students in @LOCATION1. The computer is a great way to socialize with friends. It is a new and inventive way to communicate. I know that some @MONTH1 say that there is less time spent humanly interacting, but on the computer it is still interacting. With a phone you can only chat with each other, but a computer has a webcam. This device allows you to talk to people with some human interaction. Around @NUM2 to @NUM3 million @CAPS5 have this device to use. It @CAPS1 is preinstalled into many @ORGANIZATION3 and @ORGANIZATION4 laptops, giving us portable acces to talk.

802,"Dear local newspaper, The question that everyone is asking is do computers benefit to society. I used to think they didn't benefit to society but now I think they do. I think this because, one good place to get information, two we live in a technological advanced society, and three you can keep in touch with people that are at the other side of the world. so do computers really benefit to our society? Computers are a valuable resorce for me when I need to get information. For example, in my recent project in social studies class I need to go on the computer to get information on the subject. Also if you need facts on something and you can't go to the libary the computer has the same information. Also the computer is helpful when trying to find maps to a certain place or a phone number to a store. The computer is and always will be a great source of information. In the @DATE1 technology is a huge part of society. For example the first computer that came out was this huge block that when you did something on it you would put in cardboard card.

Computers are one of the best ways to keep in touch. For example if you call someone across the world your phone bill will sky rocket. But if you go on a website like facebook you can talk for free. Also another way to chat with people is by A.I.M. Another free way to talk to people. What same person wouldnt want to talk to their friends and family acroosthe worl, for free?

Another way aspect that the computer provides is world news and big events and drama that is happening in our society. Many news channels have their own websites and update what happened on their show. They provide pictures, stories, and actual videos of whats happening right now. The computer helps us americans know what is happening in @LOCATION1 and lets @LOCATION1 know whats happening in the @LOCATION1 and the @CAPS4.S arn't the only ones trough The computers provides international news and gossip for everyone.

In @CAPS2 oppinion they are not beneficial. First when on the computer people have less time to exercise. Also, computers don't always have approprate sites. Finally, people have less time to interact with family and friends. I believe for these reasons that computers have bad affects on people. Without a doubt people who spend hours on the computer everyday have less time to excersice @NUM1 in every @NUM2 young adults are obiese. This is because most teens sit inside watching @CAPS1 or going on the internet instead of being active. Some students are so addicted to computers they never go outside! I understand that computers can be helpful to do school work but, kids who never get off can have life threatening weight problems in the future. As you know many web sites that are not appropriate for teenagers are accesible to them on the computer. Parents have to constantly worry what their child/children are doing just to make sure it is not bad. If less teens used computers as often as they do they would be lifting a nof their parents shoulders. I remember reading a newspaper article about a girl named @PERSON1 on a website chatting with a ""@NUM3 year old guy who later came and found her and turned out to be @NUM4. If kids were not so addicted to the computer than they wouldnt get into these websites. many teens spend there whole day on the computer leaving no time for their family and friends.

With this attitude toward outdoor activities I am not surprised that students wasting time on computers do not have time for family or friends. As you can see computers effect many people in a negative way. They prevent people from ecersising, expose kids to in approplate websites, and take away from valuable time with family and friends.

1629,"Dear Newspaper, I am writing this better to explain to you how more people in our society would benefit from using computer you can do work in less time it would take to do it manualy. You can interact and make more friends by talking or web chating. Not to forget that it is more entertaning. That is what computers were made for. To help us with tasks or for our personal use. How do computers though help us with work? Lets say that you are having a buisness meeting and you have to write a five page report with pictures and a graphs. It would take you twice the time to do that by hand then with a computer. With a computer, you can type you work which makes it much neater and looks more proffesional, You can copy and paste your images that you can @CAPS1 on the internet. With graph making software, you can easily plug in the data you have collected and the computer will do the rest. If you had to do this by hand, you would have to write extremly neat, @CAPS1 pictures in a newspaper or mabe, even draw them. Then you would have to make the graph by hand making sure not to mess up. It makes it twice as hard, to do a simple task with a computer. What if you want to talk to a friend? With a computer you can easily talk to a friend as to having to write a letter or talk on the phone with a computer you can either chat with a person with writing or even being able to see them on you computer screen. Instead of just hearing voice or waiting two or three days to talk to them. If you have a laptop you can talk to them were every they go or you go. Being able to see the person at your convinience to talk without having to leave you house is a very good thing to have. The benifit are major and it doesn't cost anything to chat. If you have a friend or relative that lives very far away, you can easily go at talk and have a video conference. What about entertainment? The computer is a very valuable too! but we can fun, we can play games or watch videos at as convinience. They don't cost a lot to download at all, they can be played with friends on a web chat or by yourself. Videos you can watch all the time with no ads to interupt you can pause the video too. This is more efficie, they care I very convinient for the average person. Playing games were ever you go is good and again don't art to play or.

Here is a short example. You can experience problems with your computer, if you stay on the computer for to long it can over heat and that can cause it to stop working. Another problem is side effects. you can get headaches from just staring at the screen for to long. Those headaches over time can become even worst. You @MONTH1 even get poor vision from a computer. Computers can also be addicting. Because of your addictition with computers you @MONTH1 become less close with family or friends, causing your social life to be very minimal. Also, because of the addiction, it @MONTH1 work its way to your daily routines causing you to have to play it daily and more thatn the average person does. Your personality @MONTH1 also change with your social life and routine. Lastly, computers can be very dangerous. if your child gets on to one he @MONTH1 accidentlly link heimself to a dirty or bad websites. He then to the negatives of a computer. On a computere your child will probally be shown things like words to pornographic features. These are all things that should not be allowed to access on a computer. Computers are addicting, they cause problems and are dangerous wrong in my opinion should be stopped. Now you think we should do about computers.",4,4,0
966,"Dear the daily newspaper crew, I have seen some of your own disagree about using computers. I for one believe that using a comenter really isn't that bad. For example, the computer is actually good for education. Many use them to create @NUM1 images of things for schoolprojects or science fair projects. I use these machines to play video games on to cure my boredum like most young teens and children do. Unlike most people I dont stay on it forever. I usually play for a couple hours. There are some downsides to having computer in the house. For one the machines use up load of energy in the house making the electric bill rise and @DATE1. On some websites there are people who try to be a stalker like the website my space and twitter but on the bright side these who try to be a stalker usually instantly get caught and put in jail. Computers actually have a positive effect on the mind and movements. For example children who have computers learn how to fly a kite or for themselves with their parents watching and they learn hand-eye. Many children who play sports that have computers actually manage to catch a ball faster than usual. So you see computers are not that bad. So please think of what will happen to children if computers are banned.",3,4,0
1220,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern: I will agree that computers have caused many people to spend less time outside. However, it has kept kids inside instead @ORGANIZATION2 on the streets causing trouble. Computers have become a part @ORGANIZATION2 our everyday life. Some use it to stay connected with family or to reconnect with old friends. Experts say it's bad but the @ORGANIZATION2 gives us a computer class in @ORGANIZATION1? We learn keyboarding skills. @ORGANIZATION3 techniques and how to research any topic. @ORGANIZATION1, itself has influenced computer use. If we could travel back in time, we would most likely see kids hanging around the streets. Now-a-days, kids spend a lot @ORGANIZATION2 time inside, on the computers. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I bet you, or your parents, or maybe even your grandparents used to hear @ORGANIZATION2 gangs or fights going on in the streets. Now that computers have become an important item in many people's lives you don't hear those types @ORGANIZATION2 things as much. I'm not saying they don't happen but you don't hear your child come home and talk about gangs and fights. Therefore, being on the computer isn't that bad. In history you probably learned about immigrants coming over to @LOCATION1 to get away from their ruler. Well, not everyone was able to come. Some people have family in another country. Due to time difference, it is hard to stay in touch. My mother came over here when she was @NUM1. The rest @ORGANIZATION2 her family still lives in @LOCATION2. To stay in touch they email or @CAPS1 chat. The five hour time difference makes it difficult to know when to call. The invention @ORGANIZATION2 computers has made it easier to catch up with family! Most importantly, the use @ORGANIZATION2 computers is influenced in schools. My @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION1, has a computer class, where we learn how to skillfully type. We are also taught how to correctly cite and research work. This is helpful because if we don't know this information we could plagiarize and plagiarism is illegal. Frequently, teachers give us projects that ask for computer use.. Either we have to look something up for specific, accurate information or we have to type a @ORGANIZATION3 document. As well as using the the online @CAPS2 book instead @ORGANIZATION2 taking it home. After reading all the facts, I'm sure you will agree that computers can benefit society. Students stay off the streets and only cause trouble with siblings at home. People won't feel like they've left or lost their family. Schools influence computer use to help us learn. Certainly you cannot disagree with me!",5,5,1
1349,"To the Newspaper, Computers are obviously needed in society. They can be used as a valuable learning tool, help communication, and teach skills that will be used for life. Students like myself of often use computers for many reasons. Our teacher also encourage us to use computers. All projects require research. For example, last week in social students I researched the amendments to the constitution. I went to @ORGANIZATION1- on the and sound a storage of information on the @NUM1 for my project on wehter capital punishment is and unusual. I found from this database that not onlt is it all lawed for that reason but the @LOCATION1 got from the international council of human rights for allowing it. Without the internet, which is instanly to carry the newest. most recent information I would have now to go find banks published recently enough carry this significant fact. It would mre costly taken over two houses just to find the same information that five minutes using a computer. The internet can millions websites and photo on a wide variety of toys and faster than any other method. As well as for research, school use computers to type papers. This moves than easier to road the teacher and provides useful tools like spell check. Also, using the internet you can access all of the communicate benefits of using computers. E-mail, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are just @NUM2 of the commnly used websites on computers they make talking to friends and family easier and faster then ever. Last @DATE1 my friend on a business trip the was for @NUM3 weeks she missed him a lot @CAPS4 mom let @CAPS4 she was able to would have a telephone call. It consoled @CAPS4 for the @NUM4 days wasn't able to see @CAPS4 while still being amazing quick. Computers allow people to interact with other people at once even when they can't be with that person for whatever reason. This communication element is very important just like how they will help for the future. Many jobs involve the usage of a computer mastering how to use the computer before. It is needed has many advantages. If we already know how to use them we don't need to worry about learning in life. Also in the closer future computer will be used in high school and college for helping paper researching and morw it will be faster and easier for us it we have knowledge of how to do these things. Eventualy if can read the benefits are counters. As you can see, computers and the internet can any benefits iur society school can use them for many projects and learning People can talk to others virtually when it is not possible face to face finally, it can help run the future. In conclusion compare use be encouraged.",6,5,1
790,"Wouldn't you say that having a computer in your house is helpful? It provides useful information to everyone. It can be used for personal use, such as for talking to friends. If there is a child in the house they might have to search something up on the internet for school. If you need directions to a place or you want to find out more about a specific person, a computer can help you. If you have a child who likes to run up the phone bill because they like to talk to their friends just tell them to use a computer! These are so many ways communication can be made through a computer such as @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 @CAPS5, @CAPS6, and even email! If you need to make quick plans maybe for a movie with a couple of friends just send them an email or a message on @CAPS2. Now, an @CAPS1 you can text people right from your computer! If you're afraid someone might not get the email in time, just enter their cell phone number on @CAPS1 and a text. It's free too! Now that our world has become more technologically advanced schools often tend to tell students to look something up on a computer or maybe to do a homework assignment posted on their webpage. If a child does not have a computer at home this will. Make it hard for them to do their homework. Also, if a perent decides to start a business from have a computer would be required to cant up profits and to talk with customers. A computer can also make signs for a business or business cards. Need directions to a restaurant? Or maybe a local gym? A computer can help you find directions to almost @CAPS10 plan on earth. @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS11 is a reliable website to get directions. You can also learn about specific people if you type in their name in @ORGANIZATION1. If you need someone phone number but don't have a phone book you can use @CAPS12 pages to help you. So, now I hope you can see that computers effect people in a positive way. They help you keep in touch with friends and save you money. They help students learn more and could possibly help you start your own business from your home. If you need directions or help finding a phone number, a computer can help in multiple ways. Having a computer could make you have draw perspective of everything.",5,4,1
1155,"Computers are becoming more advanced everyday, almost everyone owned, or owns a computer. I think, ther benefit society very greatly. One of the many ways is, they teach you hand eye coordination. So even @CAPS1 your playing games your hand-eye coordination @MONTH1 be improving. With hand-eye coordination you @MONTH1 need it to play sports like baseball. When do you need hand-eye coordination the most? I use it most, when I'm playing hockey or, baseball. So next time your on a computer, remember your hand-eye coordination is improving. Another reason we benefit from having computers, is we learn about far away places. @CAPS1, you know about places that are far away from you that you can or can't travel to, use a computer to gain some background knowledge @CAPS1 you travel somewhere on business and know nothing about it, what do you do? I know! get on a computer and do some research about it! An example of this is, @CAPS1 you have to fly out to @LOCATION1 and don't know anythin about it, use a laptop on the way over there. @CAPS1 you do that, you'll have some schema about the place. As you can see laptops and computers are great for learning of foreign countries. Finally, computers are great for learning a new language. You need to learn spanish in a couple of weeks. What will you do? Download a free language learning app. @CAPS1 you don't know a lot of french and need a few words but don't have a dictionary. Use a translator. When you are talking to someone from @LOCATION1 and you don't know there language use an english to african dictionary translation app on your computer. Computers have a great translater applications that are free so, @CAPS1 you don't know a language hop on a computer and learn it! In conclusion, computers are used every day and help us greatly, weather it be learning a new language, or just talking to friends. Computer benefit society greatly.",4,4,0

Also if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to your door. My final reason is that computers can save paper buy having a lot of document on your computer. My first reason was that if you don'@CAPS1 know something you could look it up. A lot of times you could be watching @CAPS1.V. or talking with someone and you @CAPS4 wonder what something is or means. @CAPS6 instead of just letting whatever you didn'@CAPS1 know just pass on you could look it up on a computer and educate yourself and possibly others to. My next reason was that if you are to sick or don'@CAPS1 have the time to go out and buy things that you need from stores you can buy it on-line and have it @CAPS7 right to you door. This is a great help to the people who are to sick @CAPS3 sometimes they are @CAPS6 said they can'@CAPS1 leace there home @CAPS6 instead of starving to death they can have food or anything @CAPS7 to them if they just click a couple of buttons on the computer.

They had to have this happen @CAPS3 they @CAPS4 worked long hours and they didn'@CAPS1 have the time to go to a grocery @CAPS5 @CAPS6 they had the food @CAPS7 to our house which was a huge help. My last and final reason is that computers can help save a lot of trees and paper. A big thing now is that we have to go green right, @CAPS6 instead of cutting down more trees we can just have all that on our computer which doesn'@CAPS1 we any paper.

1156,"To the editor of the daily newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a negative affect on people of all ages. Computers these days are being used way too much for useage of priveleges that we already have. While people are using the computer for random activities, they are not having any physical activity. Also emailing and facebooks are great websites to communicate with but people are checking emails all the time instead paying attention to when their parents get home from a long day at work. With this people are so consumed into the computer that kids get side tracked and forget to do homeworks. Computers are great invention but with todays society there are to many issues that aren't always being appointed. In the first place, people aren't getting the exercise that they need because they are playing on the computer or video chatting with a friend. About @NUM1 of america is obess so excercising should definitely be a priority but with these new websites and activities on the computer people are getting held back. With this, kids and adults are communicating in high end ways that waste too much time. The computers have so many stupid activities that are not needed which make us not excercise because many people think that the options and webpages are important and needed. Indeed computers are a technology that is needed but people are taking advantage of it too much by having their whole life in the computer instead of having it toward other things such as excercising and being healthy. In addition to computers taking away from excerscising they are also taking time away from your family. For example, @TIME1 when my dad got home. From a long day at work no @CAPS1 truly a bear hug that he was longing for because everyone was so interested in their email or what my sisters friend just said on facebook. Family is the most important part of your life and if computers are getting in the way, computer use absolutely has to be changed. Which is more important to you, family or computers? I understand that you still talk to your family and give them hugs but when you rae talking to your sister through facebook eventhough there just in the next room. It is lobvious needs to be done. Computers affect you and everyone around you in more ways than @CAPS1. Finally, computers take away family but also schoolwork and works. Most kids spend so much time on the computer and they to do their homework. This is unexeptable and can be away, kids and teenagers are always playing games, facebooking friends and video chatting making them realize at that they need to start their home work! A girl from @PERSON1 said, ""@CAPS1 time I was on facebook for the whole afternoon and then I realized I never started my @CAPS2 essay!"" This has happened to so many people because computers are too distracting and drain your brain. Moreover, yesterday I remember that I was video chatting my friend for @NUM2 hours and didn't start my homework until @NUM3! The computer evryone that goes it which is uneceptable. Without computers a negative affect people. off people exercising out with time in the computer which is unbelievable and terrible. Also they cut communication with your family making it rare to truly bond with them. With this people become glued to the computer and forget to do their homework. Overall computers are that make life that much more stressful. Thank you for listening.",5,5,1

I can tell many others and spend to much time with the computer screen that we have drifted away from our familys! I never really thought about how much I don't talk to them anymore because I'm to busy cyberly chatting with friends. Although, I don't think we should get the computer either. Online we can research almost everything in the world. I can even type my name in a research bar and find me and anybody else with the excel same name as me! The internet got for more technical in the past years. Without it, these days, just about everybody would be lost!

1593,"As the people of the world are starting to use the computer more and more, I think it has a extremely positive effect on people. Computers are not all fun and games they help with other things as well. For example, some of the amazing things the computer are; teach hand-eye coordination. give people all over the world a chance to learn about the places, people and culture from far away places, and last hit not least, it is another way to allow people to talk online with their friends. Now let me explaine more about what a positve effect the computer is for the millions of people that use one. The computer today is such a great thing to have in your house. It is not for just ga off and playing video games on, it is also very helpful in the education of young children, teens, parents, and even grandparents. when you use the computer there os so much you can learn. For instance lets say you have a in your socical or history about the country or and you don't know a thing about it. What do you do? You should log onto you computer find a reliable website and boom you are learning facts about @LOCATION1 that you would have never know until you logged onto the computer. The computer is also a great way to practice and get better using your hand-eye coordination. First you need to learn about the of the keys and where they are positioned on the keyboard. After you have that skills, you should try to look at the computer screan. and not be working down at you finger keys. Not only is that not helping you hand-eye coordination, but it is causing you to type much slower than you would if you were looking at the screen. The computer truely is unbelievable. Are you one of those people who's parents don't you get a phone because use of how much it costs without even the cost of texting? Well if you are, the computer help you out with that problem aswell!! There are bunches of different ways to talk to your friends and family on the computer. For example, you could use @CAPS1 to instant your friends or facebook to learn more and more about somebody. The comp. is so hanndy! So lets recap on what we learned! The computer helps people learn about different places all over the world helps w/ hand-eye coordination, and lets you talk to your friends! I think the comp is a in every household.",5,5,1
1241,"Do you like computers? Do you use the internet to help you? Do you use it every day? Well @CAPS1 not this article gives you information about all of this. First, alot of people don't like computers because they say ther're to confusing. Actually computers are'nt that hard to work you just have to be patient and take some time to get used to it. Also, computers can make things easier like typing. why should you right @CAPS1 you have the option to use a computer which lets you write faster than you could on normal paper. Secondly the internet is very easier then books. All you have to do is go to @ORGANIZATION1 any other search engine type what your looking for in and in a split second you have all the information in the world on that topic. Also @CAPS1 your planing a vacation the internet can help. You can purchase plane tickets online and sometimes there are special discounts doing the web. Also, you can back hotels and look at live pictures with more than just . So when you back a vacation on the internet you know it will be a good one. Finally, you can purchase anything with a click of a button. Almost every website has discounts. I remeber the time when I bought @MONEY1 shoes @MONEY2 online. Also it usually ships to your house in a couple of days . Lastly going on it alot isn't bad. I go oh the computer almost every day but also go outside too. I can do this because at night when one one can go outside I go on the computer for school or for fun. Also, you can talk to your friends or family over the internet. What @CAPS1 your mom or dad wnet on a @NUM1 weeks buisiness trip. You could use your webcam and talk to them and see than like @CAPS1 you were in the same room. So is going on the computer really so bad? I don't think so @CAPS1 it is that helpful and easy to work with.",4,5,0
7,"Did you know that more and more people these days are depending on computers for their safety, natural education, and their social life? In my opinion, the increasing use of computers is not benefiting society. Initially, ones safety while using a computer is at risk. To begin, when someone is talking to another on a computer, they @MONTH1 never know who is at the other end of it. For example, @CAPS1 a small girl was playing a game on the computer and a person began talking to her, it could be a predator. She will never know unless they meet us somewhere. At this point, it maybe too late. Moreover, studies show that @PERCENT1 of people's information is more widely exposed in the last @NUM1 years due to the new chat websites. Such as myspace and facebook. In these websites, people share their information. With this, their safety is at risk. Finally, people should stop using computers as much as they are now, in order to keep their safety safe. Furthermore, enjoying nature is a must, in our world full of immense landscapes, wide waters, dense forests, and lush valleys. @CAPS1 you depend on your computer to teach you about the world, you should cease this use. One must actually be outside, experiencing the feel, the smell, and even the taste of nature. A recent study shows that people who actually went to the grand canyon could write a @NUM1 page essay on what they had learned. The people who didn't go and simply read information off their computer, could not write this much. Finally, society needs to back away from their computers, and stop into. Thirdly, a person's social life could be ruined from the use of computers for many reasons. One reasons for this could be that a person spends all their time on their computer instead of spending time with their family and friends. Sure, you can chat with people online, but that's nothing like chatting in person. There is no need to talk to a friend or family member online, when you could do it in person. Finally, @CAPS1 someone takes an embarrasing picture of you and puts it on their computer, it is there forever. Thus, you can lose friends, whether you're the person in the picture or the addict who put the picture on. With this, you can easily ruin your family/social life by using your computer too often. How would you feel @CAPS1 it was your fault that someone's safety is at risk? Wouldn't you rather enjoy nature in person instead of which it on your computer and not get the fall effect? Couldn't you talk to your friends and family in person rather than ignore them to use your computer? There are numerous ways in which the increasing rate of computer use does not benefit society. I encourage you to agree with me that computers can put one safety at risk decrease their education of nature and ruin their social life.",5,5,1

1401,"Dear local newspaper, I'm sure you love kicking back and surfing the web. Afterall, the internet is an amazing invention. However, the truth of the matter is that some people spend way to much time on the computer. We miss out on all the other important things in life, just because of to much time on our laptops. Excessive use of the internet can lead to not enough exercise. It can cause us to be anti-social, And lastly, not allow us to enjoy the beautiful nature that surrounds us. Do you know that a very high cause of obesity is? Electronics, kids sit on the computer all day long, while they should be out exercising and keeping fit. Sure, it is still okay to surf the web. You just have to keep the time minimum we could ensure this rule by having a time limit set at home. I myself love to use the computer, but i make sure to get off after about an hour. The whole idea of the ""internet"" is such a broad topic. That leaves us with so much to explore, we just have to keep on eye on the clock. There are so many forms of chat on the internet; @CAPS1, @ORGANIZATION1, etc. Many people are always on one of those, instead of talking in person. We can eventually become anti-social due to so much time spent on the computer. Although yes, you can be talking over the internet, it is necessary to be talking to people face to face, it is as if we become grued to the computer. Websites such as @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 are also causes of this. People get addicted and are on them constantly, @CAPS4 ""@CAPS5"" websites actually take away time that could be spent with friends. So instead of having a chat over the computer screen, plan a meeting in person. Don't allow the computer to let you loose the social skills that you have built up. I love going outside each season to see the beautiful nature that surrounds us if you spend to much time on the computer, you wont have time to enjoy it. There are so many thing that you would be missing out on. Take time out of you day that you would normally spend on the computer to take a walk outside. Things outher are so much prettier than you computer screen, trust me. once you cut down you computer time littyle-by-little, you will realize all the other things that are more worth you time. So the next time you think about going to surf the web or play that new computer game, i hope you think about my opinions i presented to you. Too much time on the computer causes us to not get enough exercise, and we can become anti-social. we won't be able to enjoy the nature around us. Computer time is fine in moderation, you just have to be aware of how much time you spend on it. Hopefully, my supported reasons have given you another view on surfing the web.",5,5,1
33,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 I think the effects that computers do on people are really positive. Computers can be used for all sorts of things. Examples like finding things out about history. People that changed the world and other information. Computers give the power for children to learn.

You can meet new people and is a good way to make life even better. Popular sites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and so on make a good way to keep in touch with friends from your past, or even make new ones.

So it would help america alot to stop playing softwear and start exersizing. So many people miss out on the butiful works of nature. The cool relaxing air at the beach is much nicer than a dark stuffy room with just the glow of a computer. There's so much to discover so much to be explored. So yes you could find the gisers in yellow stone online but it's nothing like seeing in real life. If there were computers back in the early @DATE1's people would never had the earge to find new land, you don't hear of many great explorers now do you? I bet if every one took a break from computer new spicies would be found or maybe even a cure for canser. Who knows what you can do if you step out of the box and into the buitful part of nature. ""@CAPS3 come down and talk to your grand parents."" ""@CAPS4 mom I'm playing on the computer!"" @CAPS5 many times has this happend to you? Has your son or daughter been on the computer with great @PERSON1 has been over? They @MONTH1 have wanted to play the computer then but they don't know if thats could have been there last day with him or her. Computer will be here forever or almost forever, peoples time is limited. There fore hanging out with a relitive is much more imortant than playing on the computer. I know a kid named @PERSON2 who was playing on the computer when his friend called and invited him over. @PERSON2 said @CAPS4. His friend was so disiponded and angry. I would be too. Whould you like to have a friend pick computer over you? I'd hope not. There fore computers hurt and are not as good as real people. In conclusion qualiy time with people, nature, and exercize is more important than a glowing box. I hope you agree the computers do not always help society.",5,5,1
553,"I think computers are bad because people use them all the time to go on facebook and other wedsites that are sometimes wast of time. People should not go on the computer as much and explore outside and go for walks, explore the woods, exersise most people do not get alot of exersise that they need because there an the computers. People showed stop making computers so less people go on them and so people can exersise more and loss weight. If people stop making computers some people would stop going on bad wedsites. People should only go on the computer for reasurch for projects or for homework liketyping papers. Parentent and kids need to exersise to stay healthy because people do not wnat diebedes when they are young so it really important to exersise so bad things do not happen to your body people need to stay healthy and exersise.

1622,There are many reasons that computers are a good thing for the world. They let us learn about far away places without us even having to leave our homes. Another reason why computers are so important is we can talk to our family without having to even travel if they live in another country or another state or even if they are your neighbors. Lastly they teach us hand-eye cordination that is a much needed skill that can help you get through life. The fantastic thing about computers are that we can learn about far away places without having to leave the comfort of our home. People of all different countries @MONTH1 be inquestitive about where they came from. They @MONTH1 also wonder how other countries are doing goverement wise or even economic (stocks). All of this is possible and much quicker then watching the news or weather channel. Computers allow us to search the web and arm ourselves with knowledge. The marvelous things about computers is the speed of them. You could be waiting for a stock update on the news channel and wait maybe ten or even twenty minutes. However if you go on your computer and use the internet it makes you life much easier and the faster you can look up somes part of knowledge the faster you might be able to make dinner or even enjoy a nice walk outside and breathe in the nice icy crisp cold air. Also radios and television stations might be a little of with their accuaracy. Maybe a minute later there is a suicide bombing that you might like to know about or the stock might go up one-hundred points or go down one-hundred points. This is all valuable information that people would want to be one-hundred percent accurate. Secondly you can stay in touch with your family even if they live in a different country or in a different state. With webcams that are attachable to some computers or some that are embedded within the computers you can talk to them. My grandma was in the hospital once and I wasn't allowed to see her since I was to young. Since the technology of webcams were invented I was able to see her on the screen instead of seeing her in real life but at least i was able to see if she was doing okay. Webcams are a could way also in discussions. Such as you and your friend are joking and she says something you think is rude but you can't tell that she being sarcastic you might get into a fight. If you have a webcam you can talk to eachother on the computer and see if she is being sarcastic or not. Technology @MONTH1 be one of the greatest inventions that has come forth and @MONTH1 be the best one that will ever be made. That last important thing that you need to know about computers is that they teach you hand-eye cordination. Hand-eye cordination is an important skill that is acquired. This is an important skill because it allows you to suceed in life such as having to write. This skill is also important if you have a job that invloves computers because you need to know how to type and move you fingers fast if you want to suceed in this well payed job. This skill also helps provide a wide range of other suceesful jobs in the world. Computers in the long run are magnificent machines that makes life a lot easier and fun in acquiring knowledge. If you don't have a good hand-eye cordnation you should get a computer because it will help a lot. however if you get a computer you must update it reguarly so you computer will not become slow and start crashing on you. In conclusion computers are the best thing that has been introduced to man kind so far in this world. It allows you to do do many things such as news and how the world is doing globally and how the economy is doing globally. Also it allows you to stay in touch with your family no matter how far you live or what country that you life in. Lastly computers teach you the important skill of hand-eye cordnation. Everyone in the world should be able to have a computer so that they could obtain the knowledge that they would nedd to suceed in life.,5,5,1
1003,"Dear Newspaper, People should play with their family and friends instead of staying on the computer all the time. People would be more fit, have closer bonds with their family, and get better grades in school. People will alway get fit faster if they excersise instead of staying on the computer. When the computer is unpluged, anyone has a chance to go out side and play. When people go outside to play with their friends, they excersise which causes you to lose weight. @NUM1 scientist believe that it is better to go outside and socialize than to sit on a computer and watch monontenious videos. People would be more active if they stay of the computer and went outside because it will keep you happy with your body, and healthy so you don't die of a terrible diseases. Their would be closer bonds with families if people stayed of the computer. Family would be closer together instead of spreading apart by computers. Your family is always their to comfort you when ever you have a terrible day. Your family will help you get over any problem so that you can keep moving forward. If you did this by computer, all you see is a persons face who can't comfort you with a hug. Without computers, you get a closer family that loves and supports each other, but with computers, people just drive their families away. Closer families also help children in school get better grades. Families who stay of the computer and have dinner with their families typically have children that get better grades. @NUM2 scientist agree that kids who have dinner and play with their families get better grades in school. If kids get better grades in school from staying of the computer and spending quality time with their family, we could get great inventions that can help mankind in every single way. All of can happen from staying off of computers. Staying off computer is a great way to help yourself and other people to. It would get people fit, create closer bonds, and create more gradutes who go on and achieve the greatest of all inventions. Imagine what else could happen by staying of computers.",5,4,1
8,"@PERCENT1 of people agree that computers make life less complicated. I also agree with this. Using computers teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and lets people talk online with other people. I think that these are all very important. Why wouldn't you want to have strong hand-eye coordination? I think this a very important skill. Computers help teach hand-eye coordination and they keep it strong. While you're looking at the screen your hand is moving the mouse where you want it to go. Good hand-eye coordination is used for a lot of things; mostly everything. If you play some sports like baseball, hand-eye is one of the most important elements. Why not make that stronger off of the feild? Also, hand-eye can be used to @ORGANIZATION1 while taking notes. Hand-eye is involved with almost everything you do. you can't have a poor hand-eye coordination or else you won't be able to function properly. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 doctors agree that hand-eye very important for healthy living. I love to travel, but I want to know about the place I'm going to before I get on the phone to go there."" said @PERSON1, a science teacher at @ORGANIZATION1. He feels the way, I'm sure, a lot of people feel. They want to know about the place they are going to and they want it to be current. The computer has plenty information about a lot of different places in the world. Some books don't offer as much information or they need to be updated. Computers are also very good for learning about other cultures and traditions. No one wants to be ignorant right? People want to know what's going on in the world quick and easy. The computer does this. I remember when I was about @NUM2, our phone broke in our house. We couldn't go out and get one right away either. The only way we were able to communicate with our family and friends was by computer. The computer made it easier to e-mail everyone and tell them why we weren't answering our house phone. This happens more often than you think. People need to communicate through computer a lot. At work, if you need to talk to an employee or co-worker and you can't leave your desk, you can just e-mail the information to them. @NUM4 out of @NUM2 employees say that it is much faster and easier to e-mail information as opposed to talking them on the phone or in person. A lot of people agree that computer make life a lot easier. Computers teach hand-eye coordination and they let you communicate with other people. The most critical reason is that computers let people learn about faraway places and people. You can make a difference in the way people feel about computers. Write to your local newspaper. It's now or never!""",5,5,1

I think this for @NUM1 simple reasons, @CAPS1, you gain computer skills, which can help in other situations. Second: Computers give people the chance to learn about faraway people and places.Lastly when you have a computer you can chat and talk to other people. When I think of a computer, I think of typing or a keyboard. After a few times of using a computer you get @CAPS2 and better it. You gain, typing skills, hand eye coordination and mouse skills. After jusst a few uses, your computer skills build up and you soon get good at it. When you do get @CAPS2 though, you get better quicker and more so it all works out very well. When you are on the computer, the internet allows you to search anything and everything. Weather it be a different culture or even schoolwork, a computer is helpful. When I am doing my homework, and I don't know how to another a question, I go on the internet. The computer allows me to get help with any homework I need help in, its great.I can even look up something on a different culture and compare it to ours. The computer allows me to do everything I need. Have you ever felt alone, but theres no one to talk to? Well that problem can be solved very simply, get on a computer. You can chat with people even if there is no one around. You can chat with someone half way around the world. Its amazing you can be anywhere, talking to anyone you want. A computers chat you to reconnect with old friends, and make new ones. Computers are great. When your on a computer, there is so much to do, so much you can get out of it.

1023,"Dear Local Newspaper, I'm writeing to you today to show how I feel on how computers have an effect on people. Computers have a very strong effect on people. Computers can cost people to gain weight, cost problem to there eyes and you couldn't pay bills. We all know that we all gain weight at some point in our life, and we can lose that weight. But if you on a computer for six hours a day you dont have time to cook a real meal. So what do you do, you eat alot of junk food. Do you really want to be the reason why someone is over weight? Picture yourself looking at bright computer sreen for six hour non-stop. Do you think that your eyes are going to be fine I disagree. When I really tried I cant even keep my eyes open and I'm pretty sure you cant say that your eyes are going to be fine when you just got looking at a bright sreen in the dark. Can you see yourself quiting you just because you say your going to work at home. But you dont do your work, and get fried, now how are you going to pay your bill with no money? Once your power goes out you have noting to do because you got fired all because of you computer. Now what are you going to do with your life? Well that all. I would like to thank you for your time.

How will you keep up with your email or type of the articles for this very newspaper? Even though some people @MONTH1 believe that computers are taking away from exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with family and friends, computers do have a positive effect on us. The list of reasons why is endless but three that stand out are you can communicate with people in other states or countries, it's more interesting to learn from a website than a textbook, and eventually @CAPS2 will be computerized anyway. Am I right? Have your old teachers ever assigned you a pen pal in another state or country? If yes, didn't you have to, write letters? Then, you had to wait at least @NUM1 weeks before your pen pal wrote back. If you had used computers, you would've gotten a response back within days. I know many parents and other adults @MONTH1 think that e-mails are a waste of energy but actually they're faster than letters will ever be. Has your daughter or son ever told you that reading from a textbook is boring? Yes? No? That's where computers come in. It's much more interesting to use the internet than reading from a book. I understand that some students can read from a book and retain all of the facts that they've learned from that one book but various students learn differently than that. If a student learns from the internet, they're more likely to remember it because they won't be put to sleep by the boredom of a textbook. Many people have mentioned and some statistics show that by at least @DATE1, @CAPS2 will be computerized. Do you seriously want to be the last one left behind? I wouldn't I understand that you are a person who likes to keep up with the current events so why not use your computer more often? When they say @CAPS2, they mean @CAPS2. They even have @CAPS3 tools on computer. So I want you to take a survey of how many people find computers effective and you'll be surprised. Many people will say the same that I've said. The choice is yours, which side are you on? Thank you.",5,5,1

Whether you are keeping in touch with friends or organizing business meetings computer offer a large amount of aid. With the modern technology that is provided with the computer, people can instantly send messages to co-workers or friends in a matter of seconds. In some cases businesses completly relie on the computer to function; for example, to have conversation with people accross the globe to discuss they are going to expand internationaly. Computers are greatly necessary for people to communicate and enable people to make plans with simply and effectively. The computer also supplies an endless source of entertainment. With the internet the computer provides the users with websites that enable them to talk to friends, watch videos, play games, and more. The computer provides a relaxing way to enjoy yourself when it is late at night or a rainy-day. The computer enables people to stay entertained, and relaxed when needed.

People stop exercising, don't enjoy the beauty of nature or life, and they aren't spending enough time with their family and friends. So, I hope that while you read through this letter, you take some of this information into consideration. First of all, when people spend a lot of time on the computer they aren't getting all of the exercise that their body needs. They become lazy and don't want to do anything. This is very bad because it will affect your health and the rest of your life. People @MONTH1 become overweight and since they got lazy from always being on the computer, they won't go out and get the exercise that their body needs. People need to enjoy their life! By always being on the computer, they won't be able to. @CAPS1 are so many fun and healthy things you can do for your body. You can go play sports and have fun while getting exercise. Many people do this and try to encourage their family and friends to do it with them. But, some of their family and friends are to lazy to do anything because they are always on the computer. Instead, they stay inside the house all cooped up and don't get enough fresh air. This is a horrible thing to do to yourself. Your body needs fresh air, so start enjoying your life a little more people! Finally, people @MONTH1 lose contact with family members of their friends because they are to busy on the computer playing games. I know I wouldn't want to lose a friend to the internet ever again and I don't think anyone else would want to either. I once lost a friend or two because I didn't talk to them as much as I used to because I had been too busy on the computer on @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and games. I felt horrible because I didn't realize that I had been doing that. I really wouldn't want anyone else to lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because of the internet. Its horrible and you don't feel like yourself anymore. Once again I would like to tell you that always being on the internet is not good. You can become lazy, not want to do anything etc., people aren't enjoying their life to the fullest and you can and @MONTH1 lose contact with a family member or lose a friend because you spend to much time on the computer.

Teenagers just can't wait to chat with their friends on facebook and instant message. There are a lot of positive and negative things about computers. In these paragraphs below I am going to give you my opinion, tell you how people can manage there time better and the effects it can have. My @CAPS1 experience with computers is that they have @CAPS3 much information but sometimes it can be too much. Today, a lot of children and teenagers are getting bullied. People can send horrible messages to someone. They rather do it on the computer because they don't have to say it to there faces. that is one thing that I don't live about computers is that people can get harrased. Other then that I think the computer is a great resource for learning about things and also connecting with people from your past. Not a lot of @CAPS2 want to see there child coming straight home from school and go right to the computer @CAPS2 have to be strict with there child when it comes to computers. They need to manage there time @CAPS3 they can alson do there homework, after school activities etc.... Studies have shown that children who go on the computer every single day for more than two hours are most timely to see their grades drop. That's why if you mange your time it wouldn't be a problem. You want your child to have a balance in there life, @CAPS3 manage the time where they are not all day long. There are positive things about the computer and as well as negative things. The computer is a great way to research people you are learning about in school and find people from your past for example, facebook is a great way to stay connected to your old buddies. Google is also a great tool because you can type in anything and it wil give you a hundred websites to chose from a negative effect about it is that people are likely to say things on it to other people that they wouldn't dare to beg to there face. It also prevents you from doing other things because you get @CAPS3 consumed about the computer you forget your main priorietees.

For example, they make @CAPS1 easier to keep in touch with far away friends and family, they help you learn things or know the important news, and their also very entertaining to people of all ages. This is why computers are one of the most valuable things to have in your home. One of the many things a computer can help you with is keeping in touch with family members of friends that live far away. Computers can serve that purpose because someone can use facebook, twitter, or skype when using one. ""I love facebook, because I can keep in touch with my family members in the @LOCATION1,"" says @PERSON2. Also, researchers say that people who have facebook, skype, or twitter accounts become closer to their families than people who don't. A computer can be used for educational purposes also.

""@CAPS1's fun and gets my son prepared!"" says a local mother as she talks about a computer game. Studies show that computer games are @PERCENT1 better at preparing a child for school than textbooks and worksheets. One of everyone's favorite reasons for keeping a computer in the house is for entertainment.

My second reason I think computers help people is because what if someone didnt have @CAPS3 or the newspaper he or she could get the @CAPS4 news via nbc.com or fox.com and will be able to still find out whats going on in the world.",3,3,0
964,"Dear @CAPS1 Have you ever wondered how much the world wide web has to offer? I would definetly agree that computers have a benificial effect on people. They teach hand eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places and they give people the chance to recconnect or new people. The internet has so much to offer and is absolutley benifical. Studies done by @PERSON1, doctor at @ORGANIZATION1 stated that @PERCENT1 of people who are on the computer typing have better hand eye coordination than those who do not. You could be improving your coordination and not even know it! Intelligent people would agree that being on the computer is very helpful to you. There are many computer games are there that you have to react quickly to and call for fast reflex and hand eye coordination. I know personally that it has help us. Since @CAPS2 been on the computer more I have noticed that my reaction time off this block for has shockly improved! Yes, I know that some people should get outside and exercise, but you can excersize and improve your hand eye coordination, either way you can go wrong. As the massive sits in space like high take fascinating worlds it the computers. The technology of computers to learn about the far away places. Kevin, scientist that @PERCENT2 of our knowing about space come from computers! For example think about google earth; it allows the human eye to see clear pictures of anywhere in the world! I think you would agree that without computers we would a lot of knowledge about the wonderful world around us. Would you rather us not have computers and not know half the stuff about we live in? By these high tech computers we can learn about life outside like space, and other galaxies. Did you know that @NUM1 of the population use the computer to talk, and reconnect to friends and family. I know I do! I know that people shouldn't be to computer, talking to people. But its a great way to stay in touch with people. They have awesome websites like skype and oovo that allows you to chat with other people over. Friendly, educated people agree that this is a good way to catch up with old friends from highschool or even way back to grade school. Another great aspect of online communicating is long friendships can be created. Newly explain, now they not online and got so close they ! Personally I know that I go to @DATE1 camp every year and make new friends. Internet websites like facebook helped me keep in touch with her. Clearly this is a great source to use! The time has come to decide the choice of using computers would deffinetly be a wise one. Without a doubt it will certainly help you; hand eye coordination and keep you talk or recconect with people. Most importantly it gives people the ability to learn about the wonders of far away places. So dont make the wrong choice, and appreciate and use all this computers have to offer.",5,6,1
933,"Dear Newspaper, In think that computers are not good for the society. There are three reasons why I think this and these are the following; @CAPS1, people don't get to spend time with their family. Second, you can get misspell words using instant messenger. When your doing your homework you can get distrated by the computer. The @CAPS1 reason why computers are bad for the society is because people don't spend enough time with their family, I know I don't. I spend at least half my day staring at a screen when I could be outside walking my dog with friends. Furthermore, instant messenger is the most addicting. When I type something, I use abreveations for any word. The professor at @LOCATION1 says at least @PERCENT1 students spell abreveated words in tests. For example, if you wanted to spell ""what"" instead the @PERCENT1 would spell ""@CAPS2"". Finally, my last reason why I think computers are not good for society is because you can get distracted by it a lot. I know that because I am driven to the world of computers. When ever I do my homework. I can't keep my eyes off the screen. Therefore explains that computers are not good for society. In conclusion, computers keep you from spending time with your family, has students misspelling words, and distracting you from doing your homework. I hope you agree with me on this.",4,4,0
1631,"I believe that computers are a great invention. It lets people interact with people from very far off places. Has lots of fun games you can play. And it is also a great way to learn information on topics and places very far off. Being able to talk to relatives from far away places is very important. @PERCENT1 of experts say that having a close knit family will give kids a greater chance of going to college. I understand why some people think ""well why doesn't the "" I grew up in a big family and just the whole day the phone was getting used. The computer has a lot of fun games that you can play. I see why you might think that the computer is why kids are over-weight But isn't the hour on the computer. Its eating habbits. Studies show that computers are use in the winter two time as much then. Going on the internet to learn new information is a great way to useing your souce. Just imagine this you straight A student comes home for the weekend about to do the biggest project lige forgets to bring home the most important book. She is flipping out looking all over the place and hyperventalating. But if you had a computer your daughter would be able to get the proect done and go to the college of her dreams. But since you didn't buy a computer she is going to fail her class not accepted to harvard and settle for the local community college where maybe one day she will be able to transfer. So I've gave you reasons to go out and but a computer you just lost to go do it. Do you want your kids to interact with aunt sally who lives @NUM1 miles away. Also it is a great way to play games. And lastly you want your daughter to go to yale or do you want her to fail. I have give yous you the facts the rest is up to you.",4,4,0
235,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I feel that computers are a great in most people lives. One you can use them for almost everything. two computers are good for you in many ways. It shouldnt affect dailey schedule or just being with your family. People can use computers for almost everything for one their are hundred of websites on the computer. For example, you can play games all different kinds, you can also chat with people, litsen to music, watch videos, look for places and a whole lot more. Computers are very useful in many different ways. Computers are also good for you. They help with you eye cordination. You can also go online and do practice on math, social studies, etc. The internet also has a lot of eduacting games whiten is good for people who had that extra help. It also helps you with you hand cordinations because on the computer you need to know how to type. you get realy good at it you can type without looking. A computer can not get between you dailey schedule or whay u do with your family. Because a computer is a computer you go on it if you need something or you go on it just for fun for example i havea computer at my house and someone goes on it everyday and it never affect what everybody does us kids still go to school my parents still go to work, we eat dinner together we do what we have to do, and the computer never gets in the way. As my conclusion i know that computers are good to have in peoples houses. One you can use them for almost everything. Two computers are good for you. Three i shouldnt affect your daily schedule in anyway.",3,4,0
1385,"Did you know that in a recent poll in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use computers everyday? Computers have a very positive effect on people, such as informing them on news, traffic, and weather right away, interacting with others, and learning new facts. Can you even imagine how difficult life would be without computers? They are a daily tool that millions of people use positively. One way that people use computers positively is by using it to be informed by news, traffic, and weather. For example, say there are signs of a hurricane going to hit near their homes. they would know righ away just by clicking on the internet. Another example is if there was a shooting nearby. People would be well aware of the facts by reading an article online. Computers help by informing people about danger so they and their families are not harmed not only doe computers help inform people about any danger through news and weather, but @CAPS4 their daily lifestyle. My father drives into work every morning, and is always looking online for any traffic updates so he can avoid them and get to work on time and safely, without computers people would be unable to know directly the harms and difficulties they @MONTH1 face. Another positive affect computers have on people, is letting them interact with others, such as video chatting and instant messaging @PERCENT2 of the world video chats and instant messages. It helps to make people more social, by chatting with their friends. Another example is, say you haven't seen a close family member or friend in a long time. Video chatting and instant messaging will help you catch up and develop a stronger realationship nobody wants to waste time in life not speaking for a long period of time to a close friend or family member, right? Computers help people by interacting with others throughout their daily lifestyle. A third positive effect computers have on people is teaching them new things. Students' main source for education is through the computer on the internet. @PERSON1 from @ORGANIZATION1 said, ""Computers are what helps my students grow. I have them use computers everyday for reports and to extend their learning"". They are @CAPS4 helpful to students because the internet now contains textbooks they use in class. That way, the won't need to lug around heavy books, and strss out for forgetting them, @CAPS4, if the student doesn't understand material learned in class, they can look online for extra help and guidance, malking their knowledge grow further. Without computers, lives wouldn't be the same in a negative way. Computers help people know news, traffic weather directly, interact with people, and learn new things. therefore, computers are very positive, since @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 use them now positively, why stop?",4,5,0
1731,"Dear Local Newspaper, ""@CAPS1 people have any viruses in there head?"" @CAPS2 they need a maricle to pop up away from the computer. Why I stated that is @CAPS2 its unhealthy for many people. Its not using time wisely. But most importantly, it can get you into trouble you don't want to be in. Stick around if you want the anecdote for the computer virus so people can be cured. OMG!!! My stepfather needs to get of the computer! It's unhealthy the amount of time he spends online. He needs to get up and move around. But instead he just sit there online everyday eating. Another reason why its unhealthy is, as you get older your bone's get weaker and when your old you can't move lik you use to and want to. Man just think, if we didn't have a computer, all the time/money people spend on computers can be spent for stuff more useful. For example @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people love computers more than life itself. @PERCENT1 of the world spend their time doing somthing active instead of being on the computer."" @CAPS3 an computer is nice but you got to know that you, can't get controlled by it. ALERT! ALERT!!! Sirence is getting closer and closer to my house. I am getting scared @CAPS2 I am online and i'm wondering if i did anything wrong. But it wasn't me who the cops was coming for, it was my next door neighbor. I guess he was doing illegal stuff online that he had no buisness doing. See computer's can get you into trouble. For example, I remember when i got into trouble with my parents and they look the computer away from me. Now, you know why computers effect people. How unhealthy it is, to many people. Why it takes up so much time from people's life. And all the trouble it puts people through.",5,4,1
1556,"Dear @CAPS1, Computers play a huge role in society. Many adults and children spend a lot of time on a computer every day and I think that is bad. Instead of being on computers, I think it would be best to spend time with your family. Exercising and enjoying the outdoors is also a good time consuming activity to do. Studying, school work, and jobs are also important things people should be doing instead of being on the computer so much. Family is very important in life and some people take advantage of it. Instead of being on the computer all day, spending home with family and doing activities with them could be more fun. For example, most teenagers come home from school and go on this computer to talk to friends or play games instead of talking with this parents about this day or anything. By spending time with family you not only learn more about them but you can become closer and be able to talk with them about anything. Nature is a beautiful thing. Sure you can see pictures of nature on the internet, but! is is not the same as the actual thing. By outside, and enjoying nature, taking walks, runs, or even hikes, you can get your exercise. Exercising is a very important thing in a persons life, because you need to be fit to be healthy, and by being on a computer all the would happen. Adults, and even some teenagers have jobs in. While some jobs involve computers, most do not. No one can get in job by spending all day on the computer playing games. I talking to people. Teenagers well and do while playing game talking to. Computer are all the time. There are plenty of important activities, such as, spending time with family, enjoying nature, and school work and jobs. Computer are not necisity. We lives, so I think use should using them",4,4,0
699,"Dear @CAPS1 Society: Computers are perhaps one of the greatest improvements to our societies advancement in knowledge in the past few decades. These gems of future, are like a human being; they have their own mind and can figure out answers to all problems. People all around the world use them, from @LOCATION5 to @LOCATION4, to @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1, they are being used. People from ages of school kids, to adults who have a job so highly appreciated as a chemist, use computers! Do you wish to be that one standing on the side lines, stuck in the past, not advancing with technology? From the creations of rockets, engines and planes; computers have never let us down. Still, the question is this: will computerized technology benefit our society or crash it down? Ever since the @DATE1, computers have been used as an ad for new information. The speed that they are able to recieve new information in is just astonishing! @CAPS2 @PERSON2, computer engenieer, says ""With the technology that we recieve from computers, we are able to be in the game."" @CAPS2 just comes to show one of the best benefits of computers: their ability to display the most current information. Now, I can see how books are an excellent resource in society, and how they provide for amazing information, however it takes years to publish books! With the use of a computer, information that occured sometimes as close to @NUM1 hours ago can appear on the internet! Not only will this allow you to get information faster, but it will allow our society to ""be in the game."" You catch a football as it soars through the air, you track a baseball or it flys high in the sky, you grasp the face of a basketball all because you have ""hand-eye"" coordination. Hand-eye coordination is perhaps one of the most neccessarry aspects of life that a person can have. Face it, everybody needs it! So why not help your body to get that talent: buy a computer. Imagine, our society would advance in it's sports and even just with life if they learn how to coordinate themselves. Did you know that @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people who owned a computer and typed daily were able to catch all three tennis-balls that were thrown at them! You could do that too! When typing on a computer, human development observers states, your eyes a free tracked on the screen and you train your hands to manuvor about the keys all by themselves. Just as in basketball, when you train your hand to track the bounce of the ball without you needing the need to catch it. I can remember when I started typing, my hands began to naturally find the keys without me having to look at them. And the next day at basketball practice I felt like @CAPS3 amazing point-guard @PERSON1, the ball just came straight to my hand! Get this need of life, invest in a computer! Money @MONTH1 be the most vital thing in our society right now. With profits as low as medium wage, our local area is not that ""rich."" I can see how it could be hard, having to purchase these computers at prices as high as @MONEY1 each. But then just think, each book that we won't have to purchase would save us @NUM4 each. Not only do computer's stand to last @NUM5 longer than any paperback, their information is always new, changing, and up-to-date. In order for us to be purchasing new books because of recent information would end up coasting as more in the long-run. Our neighboring society of @LOCATION3 just invested in over @NUM6 comptuers for their society. The stated that it took onlyt @NUM7 months to get the money back that they had purchased on the computer's with the amount that had not purchasing book! Now just imagine how much money our society would gain after @NUM8 year! It is necessary for our society to have computers. With them we not only learn hand-eye coordination but we invest in more money for the. And now with so many things happening in the world it is important to recieve information instantely from these computers. I can't stress enough that without them we just @MONTH1 be less in the rest. Dreams of incrediable rockets and medicines and cures far diseases just won't happen. Computers rise perhaps the only thing that actually benefits our society. You must understand how important this technology is to our society! But, int the long-run, the decision is yours is make. Choose quickly, the fate of our society is in your hands.",6,6,1
1714,"I agree that we shold have computers, because more and more people use computers. Long time ago we don't even have computers, but now we do. Now we have computers we should use it. If we donÂ’t use computers why we even have computers? Computers can help you to learn faraway places like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION1, @PERSON1, and other faraway places. If we don't know what is going on faraway places then we don't know what kind flag they have and what do they eat, what do they have, are what they do, and what do they speak.

If your friend is in @LOCATION2 are other faraway places your friend can bring there computer with him or her so your friend can just talking to you by talking online, you dont have to call your friend in @LOCATION2 or other places.

644,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers can be a very good thing to implement in society. First of all, if people never used computers they would miss out on an immense opportunity to learn about the world around them. Also, with computers, people can communicate with people from across the world. If people use computers more often they'll probably develop the skills to pursue job opportunities on a much wider market. Because of this computers can greatly help any community. Computers can give many chances for exploring education. People can pursue a large amount of information with a relatively small space as opposed to using a large area of books. People can find alsmot anything they want to know about on the internet relatively easily. If not for solely learning but for reference. If someone is making a project at a school. Computers can expand on many peoples opportunities for education. Secondly, the internet can be used as a widespread communication tool. Any document or piece of information can be transmitted from say, @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1 @CAPS2.C in a matter of seconds. Simialarly if two people are seperated by a large distance, they can easily communicate since the invention of social networking, people that @MONTH1 have lost touch can easily meet again and discuss things. With computers communication is becoming faster and faster. Finally, because of an over-expanding job market, use of computers is becoming a common requirement of many professions. Most jobs that pertain to engineering require use of different programs for modeling and drafting. Also now most governments are networked with files on computers. Also, most any job that has to do with any sort of business has a requirement for the person needed to be able to type quickly. Because many jobs require experience with computers they shouls be a part of any community. In conclusion experience with computers can benefit any one person and entire society all together.",4,4,0
1408,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 is a lot of technology including the biggest hit, the computer. I say that computers have a more positive effect on people. Some reasons include that computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about far away places, and even give you the ability to talk online with other people. Where would we be without computers? First of all, is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. People that type slower usually have poorer hand-eye coordination. Of course with faster typers, they have better hand-eye coordination. @PERCENT1 of people including teachers agree with this. Is this why @CAPS1 is typing ""lessons"" in computer classes in elementary school? The answer is most likely going to be a yes. Second of all, is that computers give people the ability to learn about far away places. Computers give you more resources than a book. Using the computer to go on multiple websites, is actually easier. Using these websites, people can have a higher education. One teacher said, ""using websites is so much easier for everyone. Using them for homework and having the students take notes is a lot less difficult."" And to that I agree entirely. Finally, computers give people the ability to talk to other people online. Using things like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3-mail, and video chat. All of these, and more give you the opportunity to chat with friends living far away. That way friendships are never really lost. People never want to lose relationships. Losing one can be very sad. I know this from personal experience. In conclusion, this is why I think that computers are a positive effect on people. From learning to chatting, computers are a great way to chat with friends and even do homework. Hand-eye coordination included. All of these are positive effects don't you think? I think so and this is why I believe that computers are a more positive effect than a negative effect on people.",4,4,0

What can get better than that we can research a famous person google dead people look up pictures. But the computer makes you lazy because it makes you wana just sit there never get off of it its addicting to people but others just don't know the meaning of using or having a computer.

410,"Dear editor, Computers are a waste of time. When kids get home from school they put their name work down and go right on the computer. Computers are wasting minds of little kids, while others dont even bother to look outside because they are on the computer. If there is only one computer in your house and are no time limits on how long you have to be on, can cause problems between siblings or adults. If your brother or sister has been on the computer for really long and you want to go on and have no more parents, there probably will be some fighting and yelling. Also, if somebody does somthing that they werent suppose to do on the computer, that messed it up, the person that is always fixing it can get really mad. ""@CAPS1 a nice day outside"" is what alot of people get from there parents. Most people just waste away the day by sitting on the computer w/ there favorite snack. Alot of people wont even look out side because they are to lazy to get up off of the computer, and go for a walk or maybe play in the snow. My little brothers like to play shooting games on the computer, they are only @NUM1 @NUM2 years old! They are twins so they like the same stuff so, they both enjoy killing people in games. Im pretty sure that almost every other boy out there around there age, feel the same way. My point is these games are teaching the kids nothing. All @CAPS1 teaching them is how to kill people or animals, or do dangerous things were they would hurt themselves. I hope my letter showed people that computers can hurt other people and they waste your life and instead of going to the park w/ your family your spending that time on the computer.

913,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I have been informed that recently, people are questioning the use of computers. Some say computers have negative effects on people when using them but I for one disagree with that statement. I believe that computers in today's society have created an atmosphere of learning, communication, and an ideal amount of creative fun. Computers are changing the way everyday people live. This technology is the basis of our future, and our future has evolved around our computers. People learn so they can become better at things, be aware of what is going on, and to gain the knowledge that possibly help mem succed in life. Computers gona access to information that people want to know whether it is to learn how it dance using youtube.com, to learn about a possible vacation spot your family might visit, or to research a topic for a school paper: computers have it all. It sits right at home so there is no need to drive to the library and wait for a book with the right researching skills, almost anybody can find the exact information they are looking for. Computers contribute to people who want to learn. Being a popular used computer have beenimportant to make them the best. Whether that means faster internet better, researching book or more websites, a computer has it all. Back before the telephones was invented, people struggled to have a reliable source of communications with where communication is important because it is the main source of communicating. Through the computer, @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and emails are easy and guarenteed ways to talk to everybody. With just a simple click of a mouse a person can talk to their bestfriend as if they were right next to them. Communication plays an important role for a civilization or society. It makes life so much easier without creating a place where people become lazy. Talking to people by using the computer has become easier and more dependable than ever. People can email their teachers if they have a question for homework, people can check there grades online, and people can talk to their friends and family all they want whenever they want. So we people say that the computer. If a sibling is away at college, their @CAPS3, when a family is to gether, they could since new things are discovered through the computer everyday. can come to a person in multiple ways. A computer can emphazize the fun is never a bad thing. Computers offer video games, learning games, and that bring creativity to. This technology gets people every to have an open mind with everything. It allows them to have fun but at the same time learn something about the world or even themselves. Sometimes computers can inspire people to do something like start a group to make the environment better or go running around ther block. Even though the actual computer is inside the fun and creativity can be whenever a person wants it to be. Computers expand a person's knowledge, allow one to communicate, and create a whole new word of fun. Researching topics can be easily accessed through a computer. Communicating with others makes life easier and having fun while inspiring people everywhere makes computers have a total positive effect on people. It creates a new atmosphere of enjoyment of different things. Computers effect people in the greatest way and I don't know why some people doubt its magnificent ways of indudging people in the environment.",5,5,1

Why, because it makes socializeing easir, You can gain lots of education and also help with buisnesses. Wow, I cant believe how easy it it to ather people with computers. Computer are helping family chat with family and friends chat with freinds. It help peoples socialize by letting messages on paper that to be forever to deliver and to get one back, also if family members go away on a vacation you can still contact them. Or simply if a friend cant get a ride to another friends house they on still talk on the computer. Also a computer gives you an oportunity to socialize with people all over the world. Its amazing how easy it is to talk with other people with the computer. I really astonishing how much education we have gained from using the computer. Computers have given us to many part to learn. Before computers you learned about things from books, And many of those books could not teach you as well as a computer does. With a computer you can learn about space and stars and planets. Also with computers you can learn about other nation. What @CAPS1 culture and landscapes are like without even being @CAPS1. Computers have truly played a vital role in our education.

It helped buisnessed organize @CAPS1 work and money also its given people lots of jobs working on computers. Also it gave buisnesses, quicker, more eficiant way to put up for people to by @CAPS1.

Well I'll give you @NUM1 reasons why you should say ""@CAPS8"" @NUM2) teaches hand-eye coordination @NUM3) abiliy to learn and get your @CAPS3 online @NUM1) you can talk to people all of the world. These are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons. @CAPS1 first reason is hand-eye coordination. If you have hand-eye coordination, you can @CAPS6 anything. This can help you get a job and even help with a sport you like. Having hand-eye coordination is important because were in @DATE1 everything goes around by computer and cell phones. This is @CAPS1 first reason. @CAPS1 second reason, how the computer can teach people things. The internet has a lot of web sites about how to get your @CAPS3 online. And you can take online classes. There is a @PERCENT1 drop-out rate and @PERCENT2 of those kid don't have there @CAPS3, so they go online to take there classes. The computer can really help you. This is @CAPS1 second reason. Finally, people go online to chat rooms to talk and met new people. Meeting new people is a good thing to @CAPS6. You can learn about where and how the person lives. Chats rooms are cool to. You can go online and talk to your friends without wasteding your phone minutes. The computer can help in many ways. @CAPS1 last reason. OK, I'm done but @CAPS6 you remember that question I asked you? (@CAPS6 you the computers are a positive effect on people?) @CAPS7 @CAPS6 you think? I hope you say "" @CAPS8, they are an positive effect "". But any ways those are @CAPS1 @NUM1 reasons why. P.S. I hope you go out and buy a computer after reading this!! ",4,4,0

185,"Dear, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 are many people who use computers this advanced technology we have. Lots of people life that we had computers they have lots of benefits that come with having computers. But not everyone agrees with this @CAPS2 are many people who donÂ’t like that people use computers to much it takes away less time from enjoying nature, exerising, and interesting with family and friends. But I think on people with computer such as talking to people who you cant see, looking up information gives people something to do. One of the effects computers have on people is it allows you to talk to people you really dont see. I say this beacause not all your friends go to the same school so you dont see them as much. But they might have email, myspace, and facebook. Surf you cant online. It makes it easier to talk to them instad of driving so you can see them. I think that is @CAPS2 are activities you have to do or other activities, they need to do The second effect computers has on people it allows you to look up information. Think of it have you to do a project and you dont always have enough information on what it is to do it. But if your computer it gives lots of you can find information. I think that computer can help you in that way the endless sites of information and of better. Also the might be times go on a trip and know how much it cost and how long its going to take to set to you destination. Well if you look it upon the computer it will be all their for you to see also where else will you find this information you call to questions when consist go to the website. The third effect computers have on people are it gives you something to do. I say this because not all the time will you me to do something to do. Sometimes you will be bored something to do go on computer. The things you can do like play games. Also watch videos on youtube. For example you funny keeps you laughin add on the computer you watch videos. Another thing you can do is download music to your do you ever have line that think of not busy so do it now. See these @MONTH1 things you can go on the computer. To conclude I think that computers have lots of effects on people. These are about computer how people spend time on them. But I disagree is many good effects computers can have on people. I hope you agree with me. These are the three effects computers has on people allows you look up information, gives you something to do.",4,4,0

Now you @MONTH1 be saying thats not true, that everyone has a computer, but the truth is they don't and they believe it puts negative attitude on people. People have many reasons for owning a computer and one is friends. Did you @CAPS5 some people own computers because they want to stay in touch with friends from differnt states who live far away. For example, many people use @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 to connect with friends. I can make a connection because I have both a @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 that I use to stay in contact with family friends from all over. Some people, like myself, even have friends from different countries! I @CAPS5 that many people want to learn about people from differnt countries and this is one way to do it right now I am learning some new things about the @LOCATION1 because I am friends with someone who lives in @LOCATION2. While on this wonderful adventure of learning you @MONTH1 even get yourself into a vacation adventure. A recent test was taking stating that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people like to travel but don't @CAPS5 where. Some people say that people spend to much time on the computer but not enough enjoying nature.These people are wrong if one is on a computer and they are chating with someone from a differnt state or country then that person might persuade them to take a visit there. For example they would be able to go to the internet type in the place they want to visit and get photographs and information about the place. As a result, people would still get to enjoy nature. Sometimes using the computer could be educational. Many people @MONTH1 disagree with that statement but its true. For example when on the computer many people in their senior year of high school use it to take online college courses to get their degree because going to a regular college @MONTH1 affect their work scheduale. This could also help students in any grade learn more about the topic they are studing. It would also help them on their reports. For example they would be able to get pictures and other information anytime they wanted to. As a result, the students grades would increase. I hope many of you agree with my statement and help spread the word that computers could be positive on the mind. As a result for those who didn't agree with the statement that they are positive not negative I hope that you will redecide on your opion.",4,4,0

I understand that some people @MONTH1 not agree with me, however I propose that my side is the best. This is horrible. How can it? It distracts people from their life. I makes them blind to enjoy nature. Spending too much time on the computer is a horrible disease. The hard part is to get in your freedom is being able to know that it is ocntroling you. That way your door to freedom will be open. The tecknologie keeps you away from having fun, doing homework from school and having fun with friends. I know that you can break free from it because I once experienced the same thing. Technology is a beautiful thing indeed. I has so many information in it you wont even think a person it. I know even more than . However it is also very foul. Once I came up on a very horrible seen on the computer. I my i can shut it . Michines have a mind that it our and anything it. Changing a persons life is not easy. You become complitely new. Sometimes those changes are good sometimes they are bad. But a michine can make you change in ten minutes. Once you see what you like on it or what you want you can change. If you see something and you want it so bad. I you cant get if then you will be forced to get it by stealing. It is a very horrible thing to learn. All you have to do is learn to controle your self. Machines are a very bad influence on people. There are book if you need information.

653,"@ORGANIZATION1, The computer to me is very beneficial. I say that because if wasn't @CAPS4 the computers we wouldn't have as much knowledge about other contries like we do now. Also because it's another source of communication. Another reason is, the computer helps kids get their work done faster. Hopefully after reading this you will think the same I do about computers. First the computer helps people know about what happen with people in other islands. @CAPS4 example you heard about the @CAPS1 that happen in @LOCATION1 by t.v. But what if you wanted to get more information about it. All you had to do is type it in and it gives you a lot of information. Also it shows how the in the other places are and how people have in deal with all of that. Another example is communication. The computer has allowed people to have a conversation without a phone or being in person. That helps people a lot because not everyone likes to be on the phone all day (me) so that their of communication. Also you can go on website @CAPS2, @CAPS3 or other places to talk to your friends. Some people prefer to have penpals. A penpal is a way you can communicate with someone you never and from another contry, more you have @NUM1 reasons on how you can communicate from your computers. My theird reason why computers are beneficial is the get done with their ways @CAPS4 example lets just say you had to find so definitions, instead of looking the word in the dictionary you can just type in the definition. Also if you have to do in history you can go on the computer and find on him/her. So I hope you take this in consideration that computer are great @CAPS4 society.",4,4,0

Secondly, I would talk about people who talk online way too much. Lstly, I would say spending to much time on their computers. To start, people that use computers too much. First, people like to go on things such as myspace, secondly people like playing online games. ALstly, some people like to gosep to others online. For example, if you go to soemones house you are always going to see a young kid or a parent online somewhere or playing online gmaes. Also, peopel talk online way too much. First, they go to face book all the time. Secondly, they got ,myspace which you can get your identity stolen. Lastly, kids love to go on myspace it's the smae as myspace. for example, peopel might come to you and say do you have a so and so and sya can I get your eamail address. Certainly, spoending too much time on their computers is bad. first, kids might have problems online and to keep the problem to get worst. Secondly, might be argueing with a friend. Lastly, might nit be active but live playing or going other online websites. So @CAPS1 did you start to agree with why people should get active outside and have fun.

743,"To use computors, or not to. That is the question. Hundreds of millions of people use computors in their daily life today, but some believe that using computors does not benefit society. It is my firm beleif that they do. Computors provide entertainment, a way to interact with people, and a nearly endless expand of knowledge. Without them, we would quickly find life to be much harder and less fun to navigate. Have you ever been in your house on a rainy day just sitting around bored because there is nothing on @CAPS1? Well I have on many ocations. When that happens, all you have to do is turn on the computer and you have endless choices at your fingertips. You can go on game sites and play thousands of different games. (this can also help improve your hand-eye coordination). You can also watch movies or @CAPS1 shows that you missed or want to watch again. You can even go on sites such as fanfiction.net, and read or write your own stories! Another reason why computers benifit society is that they help you interact with people. You can keep in touch with far away family members and friends using webcams email, and chat sites without the bill that would come with talking on the phone. You can also meet new people from different countries and become their. That way you learn about different ways of life and cultures. You can also quickly contact people in an emergency get updates on events, and comunicate with your teacher if you have a question about your homework. Lastly, and maybe even most importantly, computers are on enormous source of knowledge. Say you wanted to learn how to start a campfire, you could just search, ""how make fire"" a google and @NUM1 matches would be found seconds. Also, if you were asigned a project for school, you could do all of your research easily from your computor, then type the whole thing up on a word document. You can even get a college degree online if you wished. And if you want to find a resturant that specializesin @CAPS2 cooking, you can find one close to you, get directions to it, look at the menu, see the prices get the restaurant's history, cud find reveiws for it all on one magnificent little choice: your computer. So you see, computors benifit society greatly. In fact I don't think we could live without them. They provide us with entertainment, an easy way to interact with people, and a huge source of information.

259,"As time goes on, our society becomes more advanced with more and more unnecessary technology, such as the television. What I really want to write about is the computer.

When you don't excersise, and all you do is eat junk food and drink today, you better bet on your mothers grave that your going to either get diabetes, the fly, heartburn, or any other sickness or disability. You are what you eat is what I say. Life already has enough distractions in it, why add another distraction? All the computer is, is a distraction from keeping you and everyone else healthy. The computer started off as an ""innocent"" invention. Now a days, people literally worship the computer like it is a @CAPS3. People who use the computer all day every day, end becoming very lazy, because all they want to do is sit down and use the computer. In my opinion, everybody should be a part of some physical activity. Whether it is basketball, football, baseball, track, tennis or my favorite thing to do, skateboarding. Everyone should get physically active atleast three times a week for many reason, fact is, that if you excersise three times a week at the least, that your body will function better, you will look better, and you will feel better. excersise can be fun, as long as you make it fun. I hope this essay has really made you think about how you want to live. excersise should be a huge part of your daily routine, now sitting on your buttox all day searching pointless videos on ""youtube.""

186,"Dear, Newspaper I am writing to persuade to put article in the paper about how computers have bad benefits on people. Computers make you unhealthy, bullying takes place on the computer, and it effects how you do in school. First, computers have bad effects on people because it makes you unhealthy. I say this because most people don't get enough exercise. Then you get obese from not having enoughb exercise. Eventually you @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not get diabetes from being obese, but most of the time you do. The next reason why lcomputer have bad effects is because kids get bullied on the internet. This is important because when kids get bullied the feel bad about themselves. Then they all get very depressed. This is called cyber bullying. One example is, is that a guy came to our school to talk about his son. his son had killed himself from being bullied on the internent and at school. That is why bullying is an important issue and computers have bad effects on people. My third and final reason why computer have bad effects on people is that kids do bad in school. they do bad in school because they spend so much time on the computer that they stop doing their homework and stop preparing for tests and quizzes. Also kids get distracted in school because all they think or care about is going home and going on the computer. Kids also do bad in school because they eventually think that school is a waste of time and drop out. It is a proven fact that @PERCENT1 of kids that have dropped out of school was kids that were always on the computer and they said that school was a waste of time. Thats how a computers have on effect on school. Now remember, computers have bad effects on people because it makes people unhealthy. People gets bullied, and it has on effect on your schoolwork. That is how computers have bad effects on people.",4,4,0
217,"Dear Local Newspaper, I agree that computers have a positive effect on people. You learn hand - eye coordination, you don't have to step out to go to the library and it can improve social skills. Continue reading to find out why. Computers, we use them everyday. They are teaching us something. We @MONTH1 not even realize it, but they are teaching us hand-eye coordination. We type something and we use our eyes to look at the screen and then our hands to type, one mistake and automatically our hand fix it. Or maybe when we are playing games online, the same thing applies. Our eyes are looking, while our hands are fast at work over the keyboard. Hand-eye Coordination is a skill you need on sports, and I believe that computers, since we spend time on them are the quick way to learn that skill. Next, how many student's parents work? My parents do. Something it becomes difficult to walk to the library, not everyone lives in walking distance to one. That's when a computer helps. If you have a project to do, but your parents work, you can just @ORGANIZATION1 it up, you might even get more information, then what you can get in the library. Hows that? you ask. Well, for an example, @CAPS1 you had to do a project on @CAPS2. Let's just say, you managed to go to a library, but apparently there were only @NUM1 books on @CAPS2, out of which @NUM2 were checked out. You can always check it out from another library, but that might not come soon enough, on a survey @PERCENT1 of students said this has happened to them, but the computer saved them. So what else did they say? HELLO @ORGANIZATION1! Last but not least, a computer improves your social skils. When I first moved here I was a very shy person. When I made a @CAPS3, I @CAPS4 talking to people who go to my school. I even became friends with them. I'm not saying that you should just stop talking to people in person, and use @CAPS3, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, or @CAPS8 and communicate. @CAPS9 I am saying is that if you start talking to them online, you know them a little, then when you talk in person you will see you have alot in common, with that person, and soon you can become friends. Another thing, that is somewhat related to this. I have many friends living in @LOCATION1, and many cousins in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, @CAPS9 over. We @CAPS9 know, you can't travel @CAPS9 the time, sometimes you can't even get to see them. Thats @CAPS10 social networks help. You can keep in touch, plus @CAPS11.S. not even waste minutes on you phone. Can it get better? In conclusion, Computers have a very positive effect on people. From improving hand-eye coordination, to not stepping out to go to the library, and getting that project done in time with a A+ as a grade, to improving your socia skills. Even see the data collected. Thank you for taking your time and effort to read this, I hope it has persuaded many people.",5,5,1

My last reason for this is that it helps me and my friends get intouch easier lets say I'm having a friend come over, but he got sick. He woulden't have to go look up a number and call me, he could just send me a message of the internet. My second reason is that computers help with education.

Also, @CAPS1 I have to do projects, the computer is very helpful for me and many other kids, @CAPS1 doing a project, I can't getall of my information from one book so I go on the computer and look up information about the subject.

On the computer there are many sites that have very interactive sites the you can really benefit from I know of one website that was able to help me with my fielding in baseball because it had interactive games that would actually help with things is real life, like fielding in baseball. I know there are other websites like this for many other sports like basketball and foot ball. So the computer actually helped with real life activities.

Some peol argue that the computer will take away from enjoying nature, spending time with family and friends and exercising. But what if we didn't have the computer?

E-mailing is just like mailing a letter except it is dilivered instantly and doesn't cost anything. There is also no risk of anyone reading your mail.

Read on so I could let you know how and why these things about the computer are helpful. @CAPS7 I know I said computers help gives direction but let me explain it like this. You know when you need to go out somewhere far and you don't know how to act there and have no @CAPS3 in your car. Well then think about it on computer is your only option left. Like for example when I was going down south @DATE1 we didn't have no @CAPS4.P.S and we didn't know how to get their. So our only option was the computer. We logged on to google on found our direction @NUM1. So this is the first reason @CAPS7 read the next on. Okay, okay, okay. @CAPS7 we all know the way our economy is rediculous. Away computers helping our economy is instead of people driving to go pay there bills, they could pay online. Because it's saving money and the state won't have to pay for questions to get gas for the cars often or get re-build. Like for example this gas station near my house is getting re-built because something went wrong with the pipes @CAPS7 this is costing us all about @MONEY1. @CAPS7 say this isn't away we could save the economy. Its about time to move to the next reason. Listen here, here, here's my @DATE1 reason how computers are helpful. Im other known as instant messaging. This is helpful if you don't have a house phone nor on cellphone and you wanna tell you a family member or friend something really bad had happened then you could tell thru by instant messaging (@CAPS5) because they would surely would get it. Like one time my friend aint have a house phone nor cellphone and somebody was trying to brake into her house she had instant message me to let me know because it could get send to my cellphone. And I called her mom to let her know and befor I know it another massage was coming thru saving ""@CAPS6 you."" @CAPS7 after reading how computers are helpful by helping give direction, save the economy and instant messaging, could you agree with me saying computers are helpful. Its still your opinion but you read minds so think about what you read on say it isn't true.",4,5,0

1658,"Dear Local Newspaper,Â… I believe that computers have a negitive affect on people today. I believe this because computers cause people to be less active, most people would want to be at home on their computers then out side doing activities. I also belive computers restrict people who talk through it to show emotion. People should be out with each other when they talk not talking throught a machien. Finally if people were not on the computer as much they would bring down the obesity rate of the contry if everyone just stoped using technology for a while and wen outside. Every day at least once or twice or somtimes even more people use the computer for hours on end. People today have so many options of things to do on the internet: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, ooVoo, and alot more. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say they ""need"" to check these everyday but they really dont. What they do ""need"" to do is to stop using computers as much and go out side! Furthermore, people all around the world communicate thought the computer. I talk to my friends all the time thought the computer"" says @PERSON1, ""@CAPS3 the easiest way"". Now it @MONTH1 be the easiest way but @CAPS3 also the most boring, I mean really do you want to talk like a robot or with emotion like a person? Computers dont give you the chance to show emotion, this means people need to go out, hans out, and mabye even call each other to talk. At least you getting up to get the phone. Finally, @CAPS4 is one of the most obese places in the whole world. People are sitting on the computer everyday, eating, and not moving at all and gaining weight. Do you really want to be a known as the ""fat country""? I dont think so. People should restrict computer usage among themselves to a of an hour even less if you can. To restate, I beleve that computers have a negitive affect on todays people aroung the world. Computers cause people to be less active. less emotionn in a conversation, and cause people to be obese. So please help me fight to put more people outside and make people more active, sounds like a pretty good cause huh?",4,5,0
936,"Dear @LOCATION1 news paper, I think computers are a bad and good thing because computers keep some people inside more than usual and then on the other hand a computer allows you to talk with family members that you haven't seen in a long time, search for upcoming events and see if they are canceled and to search up other stuff like when a movie is playing. Computers are a big part of school too, because without computers it would be hard to study and for some teachers most of their homeworks aquires you to use a computer. There is some other things that are bad about computers too for example: my friend stayed on his computer playing video games for most of the day. Its like when he's on that computer he dosen't listen or hear anyone, not even his parents. He barely goes down to eat dinner and when he does he has his laptop right beside him. His parents started to get tired of it so they took his tv and laptop away so he could go outside and play with his friends. After a while he started to come outside a lot mostly every day when it was nice. They gave him back his computer and tv. The only time he goes on it now is rainy days.",3,4,0
558,"Some ""experts"" are warned that people should spend too much time on their computers. Yet, look at all of the advantages to a computer. You can develop better hand-eye coordination skills, internet with friends/family who could live hundreds of miles away, and you can learn about cultures all around the world, along with the people who live in those countries, without ever leaving home. In my oponion, computers overall benefit society, helping us learn more & more every day. First off, there are many skills you can develop on the computer. For example, when playing interactive high-paced games, kids get a sense of awareness timing, and hand-eye coordination. Not to mention, with new advances in technology, people can now go to college without ever leaving home, and at a much lower price, while still getting a great education. Many people even work from home, thanks to their computers. These are still only a few of the many skills that can be learned on computers. Secondly, why buy a ticket to a far away country that's fairly expensive, trade in all your money for the money they have there, go through the hasslels of baggage, ect. When you could simply go online and look it up on the computer? You can go online, look up some of that countries recipes, language, pictures, people without the hassel of going there. Not to mention, for kids who aren't old enough to @LOCATION1, or have to do a report on it, instead of making through countless textbooks, newspapers, libraries in general, they go online, @CAPS1 their country, and they have must, if not all the info they need right there. So not only is getting the information then you would've learned in the first place, thereby, extending your knowledge. Finally, the internet helps people connect. Leading experts from the @CAPS2.S.A., or Family security agency, says that since people have started using programs like @ORGANIZATION1 and facebook, many more families, who live in different countries, have been able to re-coonect and get to know one-another. For example, if you have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, you could both buy cameras for your computer, install them, and within minutes, be seeing each other/talking face to face. I think this is better then simply writing letters to them, as it's quicker, and you get to connect more. Same goes if a friend or you move away, but want to stay in touch. A quick facebook account or @ORGANIZATION1, and you'll still be good friends. So all in all, yes, computers do benefit society, as they help teach people skills, learn about distant cultures/far away countries, and connect people, who might live in different countries. I don't see anything wrong with these beneficial factors to society. So yes, computers have a positive effect on people.",5,5,1
371,"About @PERCENT1 of the world today, use computers. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family and frinds, exercise your brain, and there is time to enjoy nature. Have you ever heard of a email? Well it's a contacting source you can use to contact family and friends. Also there are other sources you can use to conact family and friends. For example, facebook, myspace, and twitter. Even though you're on the computer, you can still do this, you don't always have to call them. I remember a time when I called my aunt from my cell phone, and it wasted my minutes. Something simple as this could've been done over an email. So computers do have a good point to it. Do you know online you can exercise your brain? You can do this by learning new information you haven't learned before. For instance, if my sister needed help with science, she could go online, and learn more information about it. Some experts are thinking that it's too much time on the computer, but it can be very useful to others, by helping them gain knowledge. Computers can even help get online, tutoring, so you can exercise your brain there also. Do you know you can enjoy nature anytime? About @PERCENT2 of our world enjoys nature. Don't you think it can wait until later? Also some people don't like the different seasons and might want to stay in their homes. For example, when it snows. I think nature is good, but I don't think others want to be out as much. Also I know we are apart of nature, and nature is part of our society, but the seasons change and it's lots od bad weather. In conclusion, the computer has some good sources. Although you @MONTH1 spend time on the computer, you can contact family exercise your brain and there time to nature.",4,4,0
504,"Click, click, click, ""@CAPS1!"" @CAPS2 no, your computer froe, what are you going to do now? Computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches you information, you can socialize, and you can improve your skills. Without a computer, you'd be hopeless. Have you ever needed to do a research project, but don't have access to go to your local town library? No problem, @CAPS3 you have a computer at home. You could just sit down type in a few things, and get all the information you need, and more! You can research just about anything on everything, because the computer will have it. Maybe you want to learn something new, but there aren't many books on it, well there you go, the computer is your friend. Many people assume that computers are just for entertainment, to play games and have fun on your free time. What they don't know is all the research engines like google, netrekker, @LOCATION1,etc. All loaded with knowledgable information. Some people sit at home and read to become smarter, right? You can do this with computer, which would probably even be more entertaining than a boring ad book from the library. Have you ever thought to yourself ""the computer is just a way for people to get away from everyone else, and just have time to yourself?"" @CAPS3 you thought that way, you thought wrong! There are many ways to socialize with others through the computer such as e-mail, instant messaging, video chatting, etc. There are various ways to communicate with people through the computer. It is amazing technology because even @CAPS3 someone is in a different country, you can communicate with them in the click of a button. Ever heard of social networking? The name is self-explanitory. You socialize with people all across the world through a network. For example, these is myspace, facebook, twitter, tumblr, etc. That is a fun way to connect with others like relatives you have never met or that live far away, friends, friends of friends, etc. You can even be really social and meet new people, as long as your safe. You @MONTH1 be thinking at this point, that a computer is nothing more than research and socializing. Again, you thought wrong. Computers are a good way to help with your skills. For example, your hand-eye coordination. You look at the screen, type your words, look at the screen again, while clicking your mouse. That really improves your coordination. Also, your hand movement will get better. When you type, your fingers are moving all around the keyboard, creating hand muscles. Not just physical skills, but computers help with research skills. There are certain ways to research information effectively. This can help for future researching, and school purposes. Without all this, wouldn't a person be missing something? Computers play a big part in everyones lives, no matter what age they are. Computers definitly have a positive effect on people.",5,5,1
135,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing to tell you about the effects computers have on people.

First, the computers teach hand eye coordination it helps you become a better speller and type fast or type without looking at the keys I know it helped me and im sure it will help you too. Secondly, computers lets you interact with family and friends and lets you make friends like myspace you talk to your friends and make @CAPS1 ones facebook is more mature if you ask me twitter also its just away for you too talk to your friends yahoo, gmail, aol. Even teacher es lets the teachers communicate with parents so it helps you communicate without everyone being in your conversation on the phone. Next, it helps you search @CAPS1 and old places like landmarks or bussnesses like salons, nail palors. Gyms and @CAPS1 resturant you can even search when a movie is goin to come out. A computer can help you very much in this type of case. In conculsion computers are good they help you inform you and they can teach you I love my computer it helps me with homework and helps me study. Say you cant talk with someone over the phone, you can email or chat with them and it's so cool/fun and it interesting how you can learn @CAPS1 things it lets you upload pictures, music videos and you can type essays.

1313,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 waste your time learning at home when thats what schools for? People are concerned that too many people are spending too much time on their computers. They spend less time outdoors, excersising, and enjoying nature! People need more time to interact with their family. People are concerned. They are concerned there is way too much computer time. One time my mom had just bought a new computer and I stayed up all night on the internet. When I woke up the morning I was so tired and I didnt want to go to school. I think you should consider less computer time. The more time people use their computers the less time they are enjoying the outdoors. Insted of talking to you on myspace that they right down the street at the park with them. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people in @CAPS2 that use alot of computer time. Interacting is a nice enjoy nature and have fun. Family activities is a nice, fun and enjoyable way to spend your time. You can go to park when its nice outdoor weather, go swimming, play sports, in the wintertime you can possibly go to the movies, go to the mall, have fun with the family dont waste your time on the internet. In conclusion, there is too much computer time and you as the newspaper editor I advise you to make computers more expensive so people can spend their money on something more usefull because there is too much computer time.

560,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 though computers have many benefits, they also have many faults too. I believe that computers and the tecnology these days have many more negative features that positive. Some of those faults are it's bad for your eyes, don't spend as much time with family and excersising and the usage of going outside is less often used. Yeah, I get it that computers are very useful but they also kill your eyesight. If you haven't notested more and more kids have been getting glasses and contacts, due to the use of staring at a screen @CAPS2 day. I know more than @NUM1 kids that have glasses now, I also know that over @NUM2 parents I know now have glasses for the same exact reason. Using these computers is great for looking up your homeowrk, but if you stay on it for over an hour or @NUM3 a day you'll probibly become addicted to it and eventually you'd loose your eyesight. The usual time a kid spends on their laptop a night is about @NUM3 or @NUM5 hours and the time they spend with their family is maby an hour if the parent are lucky. Personally, I feel tecnollogy is the reason parents and kids are less connected. @CAPS2 the kids go on the computer is go on @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 and talk to friends that they see eceryday, so I don't find their friend, mostly the girls but why not just talk to them in school since you see them for @NUM6 hours everyday. The use of technology is being abused! the computers were invented for knoledge not scandeious ""webchats"" or ""@CAPS4 pages."" The world would be so much happier and mentally fit if we stuck to original idea of tecnology. Now kids don't even take a faststep outside their bedroom afterschool, its pointless! Most people even eat in their room so they can talk to people. So thats taking the parents time away from their kids. Now that you have read what I had to say about tecnology now a days, wouldn't you agree that it just takes time away from your actual life? I think it does and hope that you agree with me. ",4,4,0
1785,My opinion is that people should have computers in their homes. Computers should be for important things like searching for jobs and other things. People can do their work in the computer. To teach your childrens how to use a computer or let their children go on the internet to they can search kids stuff. People shouldn't all their time on the computers and spend less time with their families and friends. I think people should spend more time with their families and their friends then spending it on the computer. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. But a lot of people use computers almost everyday. Probably your family are worried about people spending their time everyday in the computer. They their friends how to type in the computer and teach them some stuff about the history. Do you think that people should alot more time with their families and be happy about it the they are spending time with their families. I think people shouldn't use the computer when they have a vistor over their house they don't their vistor think you are attracted to the computer. They should give people the ability to learn about faraway places and to learn things about the internet. But not everyone agree that people shouldn't use computers because people can get attracted to it and people don't want that. To happen. And families are concerned about that a lot of people use this can of stuff. Other people think that this is a great idea to use a lot of computer and spend more on it then their families. So do you think that people should spend more time on their families and friends then picking atention to the computers.,4,4,0

1360,"I support the advance in technology especially in computers. Using the computer can teach hand-eye coordination, give you the ability to learn about faraway places or people, and give you the opportunity to talk online with other people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill to have. it quickens reflexes during everyday life. Hand-eye coordination is needed especially for sports like baseball, football, or basketball. Without computers, many people would lack hand-eye coordination. If you are driving a car on the highway, when suddenly a car swerves onto the wrong side of the road and is heading toward you, you need to react fast. Without hand-eye, you could die. Using computers could possibly save your life one day. If somebody wants to go to a foreign country, but doesn't know anything about it, he could lost it we on the internet. The internet is a major part in having computers. Without it, people probably wouldn't be able to research a country with ease or learn about other people. Some people @MONTH1 think that using the computer too much restricts people from getting exercise, which is true in some cases, but the computer is very useful to have if you want to know about something. Like who won the election, or who won the sports championship. The computers is almost a neccesity in every home. The computer gives people the opportunity to chat online with other people. Some they @MONTH1 know in real life, or some they met online. It expands peoples interactive life, helping them make new friends. Though this is great thing to have acces to, it is still important to socialize with people in person, rather than socializing online. Some people have trouble talking to people in person and more comfortable chatting over the computer. Maybe this person could make a friend, and one day meet them in real life. This @MONTH1 be dangerous for younger people, so be careful.

958,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know that computers can prevent you from doing a lot of things? Instead of going on the computer you can exercise more, play outside, and spend more time with family and friends. This is why you need to spend less time on the computer. Exercise is important to your body and computers are not. you can get some weights and exercise in your room. A run out the beach doesn't sound bad either. Just by doing that you lose a lot of weight and not gaining weight on the computer. So go exercise and lose weight because it's good for you! Computers also prevent you from getting freash air and playing outside. When your are outside you see that playing is much better than just pressing buttons and clicking everywhere. On the computer. You don't even have to play outside, you can just walk with someone or just sit on the grass and talk. The computer prevents you from doing all of this fun activities outside. Spending time with your family is a huge activity that your computer is prevting you to do. You are on the computer for an hour and your family is having a barbeque. You finally get off that computer and you realize that spending time with them is so much fun than sitting down and looking at the screen. this is why computer are a distraction to everyone because you don't want to exercise, play outside, or spend time with the family. you can use the computer but just don't stay on to long because you are missing the fun.",4,4,0
479,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Some people are debating whether advances in technology, such as computers, are benefitial to our daily life. I think that computers are a good addition to life for a few reasons. For one, information and knowledge are at your fingertips. It takes merely seconds to know anything you want or need to. Email, @CAPS2, @CAPS1, etc. can be labeled as wasteful or dangerous. New friends can be made everyday. Lastly, there can be limits set so no more worrying about to much time spent on the computers. One of the reasons computers can be benefitial to our daily life is what it can give us. Knowledge is just seconds away. Anything you might be interested in learning is all on the web. Homework, school projects, and even work need information that isn't found anywhere else. The library is a great place to find what you're looking for, but if you're in a hurry and need what you're looking for quick, there is the online encyclopedia, world book, etc.Technology is becoming a huge part of our life today, many opinions are up in the air about it. If, there's one thing everyone can agree on, it's fast and can make daily tasks easier. Ordering clothes, books, movies, tickets for trips and more all can be done online. That's not all the computer has to offer. Friends/family are a necessary part of life, but they're not always living right around the corner. They @MONTH1 live on the other side of the state, country, even world! @CAPS2, @CAPS1, email, etc. can allow you to connect with anybody around the world at anytime. E-mail has been around longer than other websites like @CAPS2 and myspce which allow you to keep daily tabs on them. @CAPS1 or ichat allows you to instantely talk to anybody that you want. These websites can't replace being together in person, but it can help keep in touch for the meanwhile. Some are worried about spending too much time face to face with the screen, there is even something to prevent that. Time spent inside on the computer is becoming a problem. Not enough exersise or time spent outside can be unhealthy. Time limits can fix this problem. A certain amount of time can be plugged in. When there's @NUM1 minutes left, it gives you a warning. That way more time can be spent outside in the open, and less inside staring at the screen all day. Many different opinions about whether computers belong in our life have been shared. I believe they're a beneficial part of our life. They allow you information at the touch of your fingers, access to friends/family, plus there's time limits. In this day/age, the computer is something we can't live without.",5,5,1
1478,"Dear local newspaper, have computers ever hurt anyone? I believe the effects of computers on people are positive ones. For one, computers let people talk and socialize, even if they are on different sides of the planet. Another effect they have is letting people work faster in businesses and other jobs that require mathmatics. Lastly, computers allow people to see far away places and learn about almost anything with a click of a button. Because of the internet, people across the globe can talk to each other as if they were neighbors. Lets say a friend or family had to move to another country or state. They could be apart for months or even years. They would miss each other contantly. But with computers, they can talk to each other like they were still neighbors. Computers also have some more ""practical"" uses. They make it easier to see their stocks, their income, and even see sale trends. Lets say you needed to make a change to the price of your goods but your car broke down and the incorrect price was miles away. You would halfway have to wait for a mechanic or run for miles to get to a phone. But with a computer, you wouldn't need to do any of that. Just log on and change the price from the luxury of your own home. There are also educational purposes for computers. Computers let you travel the world without taking a step. You could take a trip through the safari or go on an adventure in the raln forest. You could take in the beauty of the great plains or watch the ever changing sands of the sahara desert. You could learn about the greeks, archemedes, ancien egypt, or pacman, with a computer, the world is your oyster. That is why I see computers as a positively amazing thing. Because they let us do things our minds usually can't because they allow people to traverse the world in seconds, and because they allow people oceans away to talk together.

Computers are such a bad influiance to people agian because people need to experiance life an not sit behind a desk or a home being lazy. Myspace, facebook and all the other crazy site s on the web are not good. There are sexturall preteters all over the world that like to rape kids and teenagers like us at batchelder. You should not interacted with friends on the internet for that reason. You should get some exersise at the park with your firends and family. Aslo its better to talk to new friends in person because you can get to now them better as you grow up. There are many reasons why computers are bad and sometimes even worse. Don't use computers for stupid reasons. Or might get yourself killed. It makes you so felt that you won't be able to walk. Just keep that in mind people.",4,4,0
1787,Dear - Local Newspaper I agree thats computers are good for society. Without computers a lot of things couldnÂ’t be done. Computers are sometimes the easy way out. And thats why I love them. Computers almost makes anything possible. Now say if your an elderly person and you cant get up and your bodys really bad. Well all you need is a computer. You can pay your bills online or you can get a job online or even shop online. All you need is a computer. Computers are also good if your lazy. You can just lay in bed all day and go online to work or to the mall and order things all youll have to care about is personal hygenic. Sometimes computers take a lot of stress of you. No more ignorant co-workers or no angry boss everythings a-okay. Computers are also swel because its the eazy way out. But you have to make sure you get a good computer. Not and old one because it can breakdown. Dats one reason why computers arent so good. But as i said computers are very good they might be a little pesky but ones you get the hand of them everything gonna be alright and remember you can do almost anything with a computer.,4,3,0
1413,"Computors have definitely had an impact on society that changed the world. People and life are now smarter quicker, faster, and easier. People who live on opposite sides of the world can communicate in an instant, for free. But what effect does this have on people? Something this big and having such a long history can't be good for some people. I don't think for some people it is. To start with basic, some people get too obsessed with computers. If they have life problems then they @MONTH1 seek the solitude and privacy of unfiltered and limitless internet. Even if you use a computer to chat with people, it still is no replacement for the real thing. In fact, studies show that due to non posonal ways of communicating such as text messaging, email, or chat rooms, can severely restrict a pasons way of connecting with other people. Don't get me wrong here. I do use sites such as facebook to talk to people. So, I'm not going to state that online talk is bad. I think it's a very good way of keeping in touch with people you can't talk to in real life. And, it's a good way to help friends and be there for them. It's done in moderation though. Getting information from the computer is very debatable. Some could say that the people being informed is a good thing, which I agree. Some others could say that knowing too much will make our egos so big that we will be ignorant. I also agree with that. I would also say knowing some things are good, but be careful of knowing too much. One once I find computers to be great in is originallity. In a world where we are raised to kill creativity, I find computers to be part artistic. In a way. It's personally helped me to discover what kind of music, drawings, creations, etc. that I like. I can also share what I've made so everyone can see it. Or listen to it. Or try it for themselves. In conclusion, I think computers are a great tool for use in moderation. Some people who are obsessed, it can be problematic. I think they are a great addition to society though.",5,4,1
92,"Dear local Newspaper; @CAPS1 you know that computers teach you to do many things? You probably do! I understand you would like to know my opinion on whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Well, I think that it has a positive effect. Computers teach you how to type and learn the moun keys. It also helps you to look things up like people, states, and etc. Lastly, it helps you to interact with other students when not in school. i encourage you to continue reading to hear my wonderful and strategic ideas. First of all, I think that computers have a positive effect on people because it gives you the learning skills to learn how to type I remember last year in @NUM1 grade, the tech ed teacher, ma @LOCATION4, told to go on a website that was all about learning how to type. It told us that the main keys were. A,@CAPS2,@CAPS3,@CAPS4 and @CAPS5,@CAPS6,@CAPS7, and colon(;). It was very helpful. From then on I typed like that. I think that learning how to type is an excellent thing. Typing helps you if you want to become a secretary or even a newspaper editor. My mother is a secretary down town at the low form called: @ORGANIZATION1. She works for three houses so she learned to type really fast. Typing is a big part of your life. You can use it for a project that you have to do for class, or an essay lthat you have to type to apply for a scholarship ro colege. Typing is used everywhere, even in math class my teacher types up things and pits them on the @CAPS8 @CAPS9. In addition, computers have a positive affect on people because they help look up famous people, states, countries, and etc. I remember on @NUM2 grade I @CAPS1 a project on @CAPS10, and in @NUM3 grade I @CAPS1 a powerpoint on I've also done a project on @LOCATION1 in @NUM1 grade, I @CAPS1 one on @PERSON1 this year for music, and I'm beginning one on @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3. As you can tell, I've been using a computer, basically my whole life, except when I was a baby, but now that I think about it, when @CAPS11 a baby I got a little fake computer. i know computers are @LOCATION1 but they do have a positive effect on people. When was the last time you need a computer to help you look up something or someone? Priority not too long ago. Computers are the real dael. They can help you do anything. They've helped me my whole life. To be continued, computers have a positive effect on people. They help interact with other people students, and fa mily members, when not in contact. I remember when my cousin moved away. i was so sad. I didn't went her to leave. So then she gave me her email to contact her on the computer so I could talk to her. The computer has many websites where people can interact like: @CAPS12, @CAPS14, @CAPS13, aol, msn, yahoo, g-mail, twitter, and many more. i like talking to people from all over the country. I talk to my friend when I'm at home. i talk to family members. My favorite website is @CAPS14. I am a fanatic of it. It'@CAPS2 spo much fun. Do you have a favorite interaction website? @CAPS1 you have any interaction websites? If you don't you should get one. This is why computers have a positive effect on people. In conclusion, i think that computers have a positive effect on people. One because they can interact with others. Two: they can look up things to help them. Three, they can develop a sense of typing. Thank you for reading my letter which I 'm sure has persuaded you to agree with me on how computers have a positive effect on people.",5,6,1
771,"Computers are very important, I donÂ’t know anyone who does not need one. But some people say that it distracts you from exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friend. Do I agree? No I disagree with this situation because computers are a modern day tech that people use. They say it distracts you from interacting with family and friends but a computer is the number one way to talk to long distance friends and family, @CAPS1 without a computer how will those people who work for a business work, and last we always need a computer for research. A computer grabs attention to a lot of teenager. Most of the sites we use due to interacting with family and friends. The two main sites people use is myspace and facebook everyone must know these two sites nine out of ten people use it to interact just think if we did not have a computer we would not be able to interact with our long distance friends and family. My aunt has a facebook and her friends live in @CAPS2 she interacts with them all the time they @CAPS1 have phones but comp. have webcames so you can see the person too. Business people need computer a lot of course mobile computers thats why they have laptops. But as I was saying what will people do with out a computer for work they have your schedules, your notification your boss sent out and much more on the weeks most people work and the weekends we can go visit our family membere there are mosly days in a week and a job pay of course you need a computer. Google is the number one searching website we have. If you want to know what time a movie starts most likely you will go to search on the computer, if you have a research paper due of course you will use the computer. We need the computer for everything if I were to ask my dad what the square root of pie is he would tell me google it. This is one of the main thin people do when they us a computer to research. So if you! Yeah I said you think a comp. is a waist of breath think again because it helps you to communicate with your friends. A lot of business people need it to work and last it is a good research engine. But here is a little advice dont spend all!! Day on the computer pick up your walking shoes to get some fresh air you have all day on the computer just go out and enjoy your self in any way possible.",5,4,1
346,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 a teanger growing up in this technologic era @MONEY1 society, I think computers are more harmful than helpful. I presume that books are better resources, people can find fun in other ways and that computers can be dangerous and cause health problems. @CAPS1 a well-read newspaper, your stand on this subject will influence the minds @MONEY1 many. I know computers can help find information, but personally, I believe that books are better resources. Anyone can write and post an article on the internet, even if what they are saying is not true at all. People can lie and say they are a doctor in their @NUM1's when they are really a @NUM2 year old working at @ORGANIZATION1. On the computer, you can never be sure who to believe, but with books you know what you're reading is accurate. The information on the computer, (that's true) you can find a book. Sure, the computer @MONTH1 be the quicker or ""easy way @CAPS6 "" in some cases, but maybe what people need is a challenge. It seems that because @MONEY1 the growing technology, every generation gets lazier and lazier, and less and less into books and it's time for that to stop. Also, people can find fun in many other ways not involving a computer. Many people use social networking sites to connect with their friends, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, but on those, you can't tell if that person is really who they say they are or not. If you want to talk to your friends, why not call them or more modernly, text them? That way you can be sure @MONEY1 who you are talking to. Too many teens nowadays hide @CAPS6 in their rooms and play games on their computers and spend less and less time with their families. What happend to playing cards and board games with your family? It's much more enjoyable, in my opinion if you play the game for real and not virtually. You can also go outside and get some fresh air, instead @MONEY1 that muggy smell in your room because you're so busy on the computer, you forgot to @CAPS5 the laundry. Plus, if kids have to start handwriting their papers that would improve their handwriting, because they wouldn't get the simplicity @MONEY1 typing. Besides, some kids don't have access to computers, anyways and you have to handwrite your @ORGANIZATION2's, so why not? Lastly computers can be dangerous and/or harmful to health. The use @MONEY1 social networks allows kids to put all their information @CAPS6 there, for anyone to see. This can lead to bad things, like being stalked or kidnapped. The internet also carries many innapropriate images and websites, that youngsters, or anybody, really, should be looking at also staring at a computer screen for hours on end is very bad for your eyes and can cause very serious vision problems in the long run. Plus, I'm sure you've heard how many typists are more prone to arthritis or any problems with pain or loss @MONEY1 the use @MONEY1 their fingers because @MONEY1 the movement @MONEY1 your fingers when you are typing. Getting rif @MONEY1 computers will help to impact peoples' well- being-in a positive manner. While many people enjoy the use @MONEY1 computers, there is really not that great @MONEY1 a need for them. Books are better resources, you can find fun in many other ways, and they can be dangerous/harmful to health. Why spend hundreds or @MONEY1 on a tool that is not even necessary? Don't let the media fool you or pull you in with their tricks, scams, or gimmicks to get you buy one, and next time you go to turn on your computers, thinks "" @CAPS5 I really need this or is there a better way to achieve what I need to get done or what I want to @CAPS5?"" because, more than likely there will be a better way. So, sometimes it's better to say ""@CAPS6 with the new ways @MONEY1 doing things technologically in with old ways @MONEY1 doing things manually.",6,6,1
1568,"Dear Local Newspaper, I think that computers are giving bad effects on peoples lives. Instead of using your time wisely and getting active outdoors, your'e inside your house on the computer playing games or chatting with your friends. If you're those people who easily get overweight or in any diabetic medication right now, I't easily recommend you to do workout or go and invite a friend over for a walk at the park. That way you are enjoying nature, talking with your buddy instead of doing it online, and you'd also be getting exercise. If you didn't notice, you are also doing your friend a favor too. Not only are you getting good benefits on the outdoors but so is your partner. Getting more active @MONTH1 even bring your friendship or family bond even more closer. You might also improve your self-esteem because you'll look in the mirror and feel great about your new, healthy looking body. Also, if you're one of those people always depressed, feeling lonely, or just in a bad mood, this advice could be the key to your solution. The workouts and activities helps you have more energy you never thought you'd have before. if I were you, I'd stop being lazy and actually enjoy your life and not waste time doing lazy then go.",4,3,0
780,"More and more people are using computers on a daily basis, but I do not agree that this benefits our society. People are spending too much time on computers and less time exercising and healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with family and friends. As people use computers more they are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Profesor @PERSON1 has done a study showing that people who are on the computer for more than @NUM1 hrs a day are overweight and do not excersise regularly. He goes on the state that if these habits continue throughout their lives they will become obeast and are more likely to die from a heart attack before age @NUM2. I have experienced changes in my communities health due to computers as well, last year I had a friend who weighed @NUM3 lbs and exercised regularly but when he got a computer that folowing year he stopped exercising and gamed over @NUM4 lbs he now is much slower and can not do more than push ups. I do not agree that computers are benefiting our society because as people use computers more they exercise less causing them to be unhealthy. Not only do computers less on unhealthy life style, it also causes spend less time with family and friends. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of children that their our computer spend less time with their family and more time on the computer. This @MONTH1 not seem like a thing at but this study also shows that @PERCENT2 children who spend less time with their familieis grow up to become lonely and kill themselves due to depresion. I remember when a new came to our school from he wasn't that kid and didn't many friends he was still doing just fun but when he came back the next year started and I found out he had at the end of he school and keep in touch with an of his friend and to his parents. So far that week of from the rest of the students and don't much. Then the we got back the @DATE1 he wasn't at school and for the rest of the week he didn't show up either and finaly on @DATE2 and teachers told us he ran away from and has still not been found. So people that use computers are spending less time with their family and friends which can cause them to become depressed and lonely. More and more people are using computers daily basis, but I do not agree that this is benefiting our society. People are spending to much in their computers and are spending less time excersising and staying healthy. Also people using computers are spending less time with their family and friends. I know that the more people using computers is not better for our society it is worse.",5,4,1
1676,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 glad to see that you have a debate if computers are good or bad for human society. Well I would like to state my opinion if that is good with you. In my letter @CAPS2 going to tell the bad stuff about computer and why there not good for society. Well I dont think computer are good for society because you dont work-out as much as you use to. I can say that a fact because I use to work-out then a computer games came out and I spent @NUM1 hours a day playing it I had no time to spend with my family, I had no outside commaction it was like it topic over my life. Plus I know a lot people who feel the same way. The computer is like a addiction. I say this because once you hit the power button you cant get off. All the commution website are hard to get off because there starting to put games on so you wont log off as fast. THe have different website that play video of things that are funny. Like once you find it you click and a of things so when you look you on same thing else. Dont get me wrong you can see and talk to family members you dont see but you dont have ime to go to the park and have fun and enjoy nature it like you looked up. I dont think we should get rede of computers but we should spend least tine as we do know. I know people are going to be upset by waht I say but we as a society are addicted to the computer. Every were you look theres a computer. I going to leave on one not would you pick computers or life? ",4,4,0
1072,"Dear editor, @CAPS1 you think that people spending a lot of time on the computer is good, I don't. People should get more exercize. Also they don't get enough fresh air. Finnaly they don't spend enough time with family and friends. Now we have to determin weather people should spend a lot of time on the computers. Those people who spend alot of time on the computer could be going outside everyday to get exersize. Some parents got their kids hooked on playing on the computer all day instead of going out side to get exersize. They could ride bikes, scooters, play basket ball, wiffle ball. They can also go swimming play, sports, and go to a play ground. Finnally they could go for a long walk on the beach. People need to get fresh air instead of being on the computer all day. They can go sit on the beach for awile, go outside to watch their kids play or watch their games like baseball or basket ball, or they can go outside just to be outsides. They can go sit on their porch to wait for their kids to get off the bus from school. Those people who love to play on the computor don't spend enough time with their family or friends. They could go visit their family more often, go out for lunch with their frinds. Also they can spend more time doing things with their kids. Even though there is a chat on the computer it is nice to talk to your friends in person. The time has come to decide weather people spending a lot of time on the computer is a bad thing or not. They don't ge enough exersize every day. They also don't get enough freshair. Finally they spend time with their friends and family. So now you need to write a letter to your local newspaper telling them which you are choosing.",4,4,0
247,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 people are now using computers. However, everyone is entitled to their own opinion about them. Some people don't like them, and then there's people like me who do like them. Computers can let you communicate faster, you can play all sorts of games for @CAPS3, and it provides information. Nine out of ten people love what computers can do for them. Unlike sending and writing letters to people, instant messaging is a much faster and easier way to talk to another person. Sending and receiving letters can take days or weeks, on the other hand, instant messaging takes only a few seconds! Even better, it's @CAPS3! Instant messaging is not the only way you can communicate with friends or family, there is also video chat. Video chat is just like talking on the phone but you can also see the person you're talking to. You can be talking on video chat with someone from another country, and guess what? It's also @CAPS3! When you make long distant calls, it can be very costly, but video chat won't cost a penny out of your pockets! Not only is a computer good for communication, but you can also play fun and entertaining games! Everyone enjoys playing games, whether you're one or eighty-two. There are @CAPS2 websites on the internet and among them there are game sites. Most game sites have virtual games that you can play online for @CAPS3! There's one player, two player, and party . This means you could play alone, with a friend, or the whole family. Everyone on in and have a time. Also, computers could be for fun and your used for work. The @CAPS2 information. It's like your own personal library at home at a touch of a finger! Either you're doing research on a project, , or just want to be informed, the internet can help you with any subject. All you have to do is search the topic you need whether it's cooking a certain dish, learning about space, trying to spell a word, or anything you can think of, and it'll all be there for you, and once again, for @CAPS3! In conclusion, computers are useful for @CAPS2 things and these are just a few examples. I hope you think of computers the way I, and millions of other people, do.

1458,"Due to an on going debattle about weither or not computers benefit society I am writing to you to inform you of my opinion on this mater. I believe that computers have more of a benefit than they do a draw back. I believe this because. First of all, computer bring about online communication. Also computers advance and enhance learning, had to mention that computers advance emloyment. As I mentioned, computers bring about online communications. Now after reading this there must be one side running thru your head define this well online communication, include social networkinjg sites litre facebook and twitter and not to forget my space. This also includes email and blogs and some chat sites. Okay enough of that But how do these things inventions iprove our lives. These inventions allow long distance communication bringing people ""closer together."" @CAPS1 example, my uncle lives in @LOCATION1. And thru facebook, my mother can speak with him any time she wishes and over from their relatives. So online communication @MONTH1 be very nessary @CAPS1 same. Also you could use email to communicate with others although it travels slower than other of electronic communication. Besides, I mentioned learinig. Computers can improve learning in a variety of ways. Computers improve learning because they speed the flow of information to the students can go to such places and a school websites to findout more on a particular occuring at the school. @CAPS1 example, I go on my school's website to retreve nightly homewrok assignments and read the next day's daily annocments. Teachers might post helpfel hints on homework and @MONTH1 a detailed explanation of the assignment. Also computers can improve learning by assiting with research projects @CAPS1 example a couple of weeks ago my health class was information car our illegal drug project. So with the information, made of wide variety of brouchers from it.",4,5,0
10,"In the @LOCATION1 we have the technology of a computer. Some say that the computers are good for the society. I disagree, I believe that it is bad for a few reasons. Some of the reasons are obesity, cramps, more sexual harrassment and even cyber bullying. First if people don't get off the computers and go out to exercise then it will cause obesity. Think of it this way, if you watch a kid that didn't have to go to school his entire life and he started off at @NUM1 pounds. The only thing the kid will want to do is play on the computer and he will gain weight. Next, tip-top-tip-top, that's all you hear when a kid is on the computer, @CAPS1 teens come home from school and go straight to the computer and don't get off about on a school night. These are the kids that are @CAPS1 likely to get bad cramps. they get the cramps form typing to fast, hard and too long. They also can get the cramps from just sitting down for to long then trying to get up but can't because it hurts to much to decide to move anywhere. There's also a lot more of sexual harassment that is going on some kids goin to a chat room to talk to their friends about some great news, but when they get out of the chat room they are all mad and pissed off. The reason is because someone was making fun of them and they didn't like it. This happens maybe close to @PERCENT1 of the time that teens and even parents go into chat rooms online. This is the third reason on why computers have an huge effect on people. The last reason that computers have a huge effect on people is because of cyberbullying. cyberbullying is when someone bullies you but just online instead. Have you realized that children became poor or sick because they dont want to be hurt or killed over something very stupid? Well, I have and it's not nice, and now the god thing is if a kid goes to school online he/she @MONTH1 get cyberbullied because he's not smart enough or if he/she don't have the money to go to school. The cyberbullying normally occures in a chat room online. There is where all of the family will either become broke with no money or food. They @MONTH1 even lose their kid or the house that they live in because someone wanted to act all big and bad to be popular in school. In conclusion, these are only a few ways that computers effects people. The obesity, cramps, sexual harrassment and cyberbullying are not a joke and it's not fun to get done to you. Now it's your turn to tell us what you think about the computers. Do you think computers are good and benefits society or is it bad a rot little kids brains to make their lives horrible for them to live with?",5,4,1
797,"Dear @CAPS1 post, Computers are an advance in technology, in a good way. They do benifit are society grately. Its a way that family members can keep in touch, it makes your life easier booking a flight and keeping a flight and tastly they help kids with school work. They can bring people together. Firstly, they are a great way to keep in touch. In my own expierence I have a brother at college and when I miss him or need to talk to him I can always send him an email or vidoe chat with him. Do you have someone, you don't get to see everyday? It can really make your family closer, because you talk more, with your realitives, and with friends. Friends more and go away but you can always chat it you need them. In a time of pain all you want is a friend. When the friends away, a computer probably helped our, too, just getting there. Booking plans without a computer would be a hasal, waitting on the phone for hours, at end, with computers you can do it all in all about five minutes. I have had a expierence when my plane was canceless but didn't know until, she went on the computer and checked. So she just switche are flight and we were off but could you imagine going the next day to find out that your flight was canceled and try all day to get on a flight and might not. With computers you can check every hour on the hour if you like. It well even say if there delayed so you don't wait in the airport for five hours. When it comes to traveling computers are a hesasity. Has that ever happened to you? Most likly. Yes once you were happy you had a computer. On the other hand, it also helps with your education. When class is over and your teacher is trying to scramble to get the homework out, mostly no ones listioning all they want to do is scat. About nine out or ten kids won't know the assignment when they get home that night. I know thats happened to me. As a eighth grader you probably did the of just forgeting all about and just taking the concerned. You could use your computer. Most schools use some or device, here at @CAPS2 he have were all are teachers post, grades, test/quizs coming up and homework. It's just one click away from every thing we need. It all right there, together. Most @CAPS3 kuchers will be a let happier if their kids come, in with there homework then without. Wouldn't you be? From school fund raisers to the lunch menu its all there. In conclusion, computers do help us from everyday use. to special uses. It helps use make are family stronger, help us keep are flight out and help us get homework, for school the next day. Computers are a help to the society, in a great and convienent way.",5,5,1

But sometimes computer are bad because when people go on web sites to chat peoples can be grown ups but talking to little kids. ,3,2,0
1192,"Dear @LOCATION1, I'm writing this letter to you to tell you my opinion on the effects computers have on people. My opinion is that computers have a positive effect on people. First reason is they give the ability to learn about people and places in the world. Another reason is that computers bring unity to the nation and even the world. Last reason is it can help you be organize and get a job. Now I will move on to give more details on my first reason. When I have a school project on a famous person or somewhere in the world I know that the computer will give me more information than a book. If I am doing the project on a place and I want to know how far is it from where I live to there or whats the weather of that place all I have to do is type it down in a search engine and the computer will give me a bunch of websites that will answer my question. Now, if you can't draw a picture for your biography project go on a search engine and type down the name of the person you're doing and don't for get to type down pictures or photos and you will see a bunch of pictures of that person. Now I will move on to my second reason. Computers bring unity in the nation and the world for example think about these social networks like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 these networks has millions of people on them that you can talk to. And what about the @ORGANIZATION1, webcam, where you can talk to the person face to face. Just recently there been earthquakes in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3 you can spread the news to family members or friends to tell them to support and help those in need. Now I will move on the my last reason. Computers are everywhere there's never a job that does not have a computer. That means that you need to know how to work with computers to get a job which can be.",4,4,0
243,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 would life effect you if you did not have a computer? I strongly belive that computers have a great effect on people all around the world. It helps you at work for a job and at school. Computers also help students and adults talk to people. Many people want to go to places but they do not know what the place looks like or where it is. With a computer, you can find out all of that information. Read in to the minds of the students and see what we have to say on this topic. With a computer it is much easier at your job or at school. Just think, without computers people would need to write every paper by hand and we all know that can take hours. When you type a paper for school, you go to spell check and then you know everything is correct. If you write a paper by hand, there is a huge chance that some words could be spelt wrong. Work get finished a lot a quicker on the computer so you have more time to do other things like hang out with friends. If you rush on a paper, the people reading it will have a tough time trying to figure out what it says, on the computer, you work is always going to be neat. You mcan e-mail your work to a friend or save it to your computer so if. you need to change something for a paper, it will be a quicker than having to rewrite the whole paper over. Computers do not effect me in a horrible way because it helps 'me get my work done faster. Computers help people communicate with other people. By having a computer people can talk to other people. In many schools students ask their friend a question about homework. Without a computer, people would have no way of asking questions and end up getting it wrong. I like to hang out with my friends and in order to do that you have to make plans. When you are on the computer, you can go on facebook and if they are on, talk to them about what they wanted to do kthat night. It is so much easier to do instead of looking up their number and calling them. Many people in the world have old friends from school that they want to stay in touch with. Now with a computer they will have no issue doing that. You will finally be able to look up a place you want to go. Many people in this world like to travel on the computer you can look up maps and see the shortest way to get to the place, you want to go, you will see if they easy way to get there and that might not he by car. i would not want to go to a place that did not look eye catching. Now I can just go on the website and find out 'everything I wanted to know about that place. If a place is @NUM1 hours away, I would not want to travel that far so I would need to know if a place is close to where I live computers really tell you a lot about it and what the weather is mostly like. i use the computer for mostly everything I do. Comming through our minds have showed you what we have thought about the effects computers have on us today. We can make work a lot easier, talk to other ;people, and get imformation on places you want to visit somebody. The computer is a very reliable source for me and you have lost a lot if you do not agree with me on this.",5,6,1
1267,"In my opinion i think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers allow you to communicate will people from anywhere in the world. You can learn about different places much faster than you would if you read a book. Also many more jobs want people with computer skills. It is also fun and educational. Can you imagine how much harder it would be to communicate with someone who lives in, lets say @LOCATION1. It would be a lot harder, dont you think? Well thanks to computers it is as easy as turning on your computer. Many teachers enjoy doing activities with penpals. That would be a lot harder if you had to write letters. It would also cost a lot more money to call. Also, if you were looking for specific information about florida it is alot easier on a computer. You just type in what it is you are looking for, rather than reading through tons of books, in which case you might not even find what you are looking for. Also the computer has millions of iinformation. The computer also has various pictures which is also good. Another good reason is that many more jobs these days want to hire someone who knows how to work with computers. You can do a lot more things on a computer that you cant do on a piece of paper. For example make animated movies and video games. These things have evolved over the years thanks to computers. Finally my last reason, its not only educational its also fun. Sure you can research information and do you rhomework on the computer, but you can also play games. Computers can do all sorts of different things. Computers can be programed to have simulations for jobs like policemen ambulance drivers, and doctors. These are all things that save lives. That is why i think computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers our country probably wouldn't be as evolved as it is today.",4,4,0
1126,"@ORGANIZATION1, I strongly believe that we need computers. Computers are very helpful they are a very big part in are world, ability to learn about very interesting facts, and they allow people talk online too. After reading my letter I hope you agree with me. First of all compters are important because as our world gets more technilque inclined compters are need for almost every job and you will want people to know how to work a computer. Police officers use compters to find want criminals and put criminals into the computer to keep them on files. Schools use computers everyday for kids to do reports on, find information, and do homework on too. As a student I know that kids use computers all the time. For example @TIME1 I used computers to do my math homeworks that my teacher assigned me. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. Secondly you have the ability to research places all over the world. Another good thing with computers is that you can look up the news and be updated everything that is going on right now. Computers are just great to use because if you don't like write you have a computer and you might even get it done faster if you are a good and fast type. I use computers to do all my essays and book reports for @LOCATION1 I also use it for look at the news to see ehats going on in the world. Lastly computers are get because they allow you to talk to people online. You can either email them or talk to them from a web cam. Online chat is good to keep in touch with a friend from far away or even ask a friend ehat the homework was tonight. I like to ise a web cam for the reasons I just listed because on my birthday my sister could't come home from college so we hooked up some web cams so she could be there when we open presents and song happy birthday. After you read my letter I hope you will agree with me. I hope I have persuaded you to show you that computers are very important and that why we use them so much beccause computers are very helpful, they give you the ability to learn interesting facts and they allow you to talk to people online.",5,5,1
1525,"Dear local Newspaper, I was reading this article about computers. I agree with kids and adults not having time enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But, also, kids and adults should be having some fun time outside and enjoying it. But when it comes to usage of computers is helpful for searching information. I think kids and adults need to get active and get healthy, because now kids don't want to play outside, so they can play outside, so they can play video games. When I was a little kid I would always play hide and seek but now my mother doesnt like to play anymore because of technology she rather be on the computer or on the phone. Kids all over the world now know how to use computers because they don't want to be outside. Computers are only helful when your doing a report or something, important. For example, people that have businesses they are going to need computers. Also when a teacher a sighs a project on someone your going to need a computer to search up information for that person. Finally alot of kids aren't taking responsibilty of school. They don't that school serious. Kids think that the computers will teach you everything well there wrong because things on the computer can be made up. But its also making there life very in healthy. So thats why computers are good usage and bad at time because kids don't play outside anymore and computer are helpfull for searching information so with. What I've sadi don't you agree with me?",4,4,0
1162,"Dear Local @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 I see why some people think that computers and technology are bad for society, I on the other hand strongly disagree with them. In my eyes technology, especially computers can bring people together and computers are very benificial to @CAPS5. Also computers can save you time and money now. First off computers can bring people together. I had one of my best friends move across the country, all the way to @LOCATION1! and I don't get to see her so I now video chat with her on my laptop. and if I didn't have that opportunity then we probably wouldn't have stayed in touch with each other. That experience was not only with a friend but it happened with a family member as well, my grandmother. Every year for passover the whole family comes to house to celebrate but because she is getting older we video chat so she can see the whole family together. It is wonderful experience. As I said before computers can be benifical to @CAPS5. You might be thinking ""@CAPS3 it can only understand that but I am a student at @ORGANIZATION1 and sometimes I forget to write an assignment down so I get my laptop and go to @ORGANIZATION1 notes. com, if that was have gotten a zero on the homework. See! Computers are very benifical! Have you ever been in a situation where you need something but you just don't have time? Well now many things can be ordered offline. You can get things from food to cloths and toys. Surveys have proven that over @PERCENT1 of average @CAPS4 order off of the computer and save money from gas because they don't have to drive. Overall, I think computers can be handy and helpful to all ages, @CAPS5 with homeworks, family and friends and adults who don't have a lot of time. And I think as years go by more and more people will start to realize that.",4,4,0
929,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe computers are a huge benefit to society. I myself have a computer; it is very important and useful to me. Over @PERCENT1 of the families in our town own at least one computer. Computers are a great source of information. They also allow you to talk to people, even if they are far away. They are also very convenient and easy to use, in mu opinion. Based on these positives, @CAPS3't you agree with my opinion? Computers are a great source of information. Unlike books, which you must find and buy, there is an enormous amount of information just a mouse click away! With computers, you can learn about far away places and people without having to visit or talk to them. Let me compare this to a book. Let's say you wanted to do research on @PERSON1. You would have to go to the library and search for a book about him. And what would you do if you couldn't find one about him? With a computers you could type ""@CAPS2 of @PERSON1"" into a search engine and receive of information in under a minute! I love saving time, and computers help me do that. They also augment the information I use. Another astounding development in computer technology is that you can talk to other, no matter where their location is. Email is extremely faster than writing a letter. having to pay to travel. Who @CAPS3't like that? Computers are very convenient. You can surf the internet, talk to people, and much more from the comfort of your bedroom. There are jobs that you can do from home on a computer. No need to go anywhere to work. My uncle is one of those people. He is s stockbroker, and operates his whole job from the computer in his house. It is a convenient and a well-paying job. I asked him what he thought of his job. He said, ""I love my job because I can work when I want to work, and from the comfort of my home."" @CAPS3't you want to have his job? I would most definately. In conclusion, computers are very beneficial to us. Did you know computers were first invented by @ORGANIZATION1 to perform calculations that were very long? Look at what they have involved into @DATE1. They bring us information at amazing speeds. They let us talk to people all over the world. They are very convenient. These are major benefits to society, and everybody should embrace computers.",5,5,1
362,"Newspaper, I feel that the use of computers is no big deal. it is a convienient way to communicate, it teaches young adults and adults social and life skills, and is no different than other addictions. These three reasons are why I feel the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated. My firsty reason why I feel that the @ORGANIZATION1 is under-appreciated is that some people think that less time is spend with family, but I talk to family, and friends everytime on the @ORGANIZATION1. It is a conveinient, fast, and for the most part safe way of communicating. When I need help with something, I sit at the @ORGANIZATION1 and fb chat someone, or if their not on, I e-mail them. I get my answer within a day. Also you can look up the answer online, the internet is a beautifully smart device. Also if you call someone versus chating on the @ORGANIZATION1 you @MONTH1 have no idea who they are, it is also much easier to trace a call then trace a @ORGANIZATION1 to a certain location. Communication is faster, safer, and more conveinient over the @ORGANIZATION1. My second reason for being @NUM1 is that it can help teach said and life skills. For example, did you know that on average, an adult will make @MONEY1 more if they know how to type good, and fast? The @ORGANIZATION1 serves many functions. Facebook, for example, is a social network, amny young adults can learn basic social skills by having a facebook. Social skills play a very important role when you are finding a job for the first time. If you have good social skills, your boss @MONTH1 like, and apreciate you more. Which can only lead to a promotion! Computers are very nifly to have around! my third, and final reason, for believing, with all respect, that @NUM2 people are blinded, is that people don't easily get addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. It is very hard to become addicted to the @ORGANIZATION1. Only about @PERCENT3 of facebook users are addicted. Compared to an alcohol addiction, about @PERCENT1, or drug addiction, @PERCENT2, @ORGANIZATION1 addiction is microscopic, and not to mention, not deadly. The only similarity between the @ORGANIZATION1, and other deadlier addictions is that they are addicted, and @MONTH1 become grumpy if asked to stop. ""@ORGANIZATION1 addiction can be cured with a speedy recovery, and as long as you are on for an hour or less a day, there is nothing to worry about"" says @PERSON1, at the @NUM3.) @CAPS1 there you have it, computers use is not a major problem. It is a conveinent communication device, an effective way to learn social, and life skills, and is no huge major source of addiction. @CAPS1 there is nothing to worry about. Sit back and look it up on the internet if you don't believe me.",5,5,1
1621,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you belive that the advances in our technology are not good for our society you must be misunderstanding computers have a positive affect on the people in our community by giving us well hand and eye coordination and giving us the ability to seek and find information to learn. It can also allow people to communicate online with others. Hand and eye coordination is an important thing that helps us everyday. @CAPS2 new technology such as computers, can help us with that skill, we should use it. @PERSON1 of @ORGANIZATION1 says, ""Computers do help us a lot; almost @PERCENT1 of active computer users do improve their hand and eye coordination just by using the computers for a small amount of time everyday."" @CAPS3 and education are essential, especially now; the more you learn, the better salary you get. With this new technology, you can earn degrees and learn in a short period of time. My aunt got her @CAPS4 online about six months ago, and just because of that, got promoted at her job. Gaining valuable @CAPS3 online doesn't just go for adults but children as well. @CAPS2 they have a report on @CAPS5 or need some help on their homework, these new technologies are one of the most effective, fastest ways to learn and find information. @PERSON2, a doctor that specializes in @CAPS6 emotions/feelings says in the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 last month that, ""in this new millenium, preteens and teenagers simply love the new advances in technology, and @CAPS2 we want them to learn, then we can take this tool and have them use it."" Computers are also a great way to communciate it's fast and easy. I have an uncle who lives in @LOCATION1, and we rarely get to see each other due to the distance, som we catch up by messaging each other by social netwroks or emails. It's even free, unlike the costly long distance calls. The communication is also great for businesses. A company can reach out and contact their customers to reschedule an appointment, give receipts, advertist and many other things. Computers are essential and effective techorlogy that are use by people around the country and world. They improve hand-eye coordination, allow people to gain @CAPS3 and education, and gives people opportunity to communicate with others. this is another great and useful step in our communities around the world.",5,5,1
1388,"Computers have a positive effect on peoples lives. They are big helpers. They teach you skills you need in life. The technology abilities help us with tasks every day. Finally they help people to keep in touch and meet knew people. I think that computers have a very positive effect on our lives. Computers teach us many things. First of all just learning how to use the computer is a skill you need in life. At most jobs you have to know how to work a computer. Today computers are essential part of most work enviornment. Hand-eye coordination is another skill the computer teaches you. Computers actually help you with sports in a way. To catch a ball you need hand-eye coordination. The technology the computer gives us helps us alot in life. If you need directions you can look it up on the computer. If you couldn't you would have to call the resturant for directions. Without the computers help we would all have to write all of our papers out. For students it would be a nightmare to have to do reports without a computer. We would have to read so many books to get the information. The world would be a much different place without computers. Sometimes people who we love have to move far away from us. It's hard to keep in touch on the phone when that happens. The computer through keep you in touch. With programs like facebook, twitter, and @ORGANIZATION1, its possible. You can chat with them pictures of how there doing. You could even keep in touch with them from @LOCATION1. Computers almost anything possible. In conclusion computers are great machines. They teach us life long lessons. They help us when we need something or have to do a report. Computers even keep people in touch so their relationships don't fall apart. I don't know about you, but I think computers keep the world up and running.",4,4,0
817,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, A resent concern has built up among experts that computers @MONTH1 have negitive affects on the society. I do not agree with this. Computers ease life, teach you about faraway places and people, and finaly you can chat with others. I belive computers can only benifit a society. As previously mentioned, computers ease the hassels of life. With computers you are able to plan your life with @CAPS1 output. This program ables you to enter data on places you have to go and reminds you when time is done to that event. With this program you will never forget where you have to go. Also, with the computer you are able to gather information at extreamly high speeds. Supose you are doing a research project in school on types of cars, you just enter cars on @ORGANIZATION3 and get millions of results. this save much time than going on the librery and finding a book. This can take up to on how . Finally, with a couputer handy there are programs for special needs people to wright. New programs such as @ORGANIZATION2 word have a special function called voice commands. This lets a person who can not wright because of blindness or a disability speek to the computer what he or she wants to wright. In an istant it will pop up on the screen. Computer ease peples' lifes jarasticly. Besides esing lifes, computers teach you about far away places and people. pictures on a computer give one a first hand acount of how a far away place is like. Insead of just reading about it you can see it. Acording to time magazine if a person sees a place they will learn more by @PERCENT1 than reading an encyclopedia. As well as pictures, blogs give people an idea of how a person lives in a regular day in that place and how they feel about it. This is another first hand acount of the place. Finally, ebooks on the internet give you a large amount of information. Ebooks are books but in an internet format. These books inclued encyclopedias that give statistics and, pores, and events that are in the far of place. For example if you are planning a trip you can learn where to eat and where to get entertained. you can learn about far of places and people in them with computers. Lastly, with computers you can talk to people around the world. you can talk to friends. Have you ever moved and wanted to talk to a friend from where you previously lived? Now you can esily do so with video chat. Not ownly can you talk to someone you can see them. i remember @NUM1 years ago when I moved to @LOCATION1, I mised my friends in @LOCATION2 so i video chted them. As well as talking to friends, one can have a bussness meating around the world with out having to traval out of your town. For example if a company wanted to make a trading agreement with another company in @LOCATION3 they could do so with a click of a mouse. This will save time and money of travaling. Also you can talk to others online to get a feel of what happened. For example @CAPS2 a few weeks ago, video chated many people in @LOCATION4 to undersand now bad conditions were after earth quake. You can talk to people with ease with an computer availible. In conclusion, I believe computer are benifical to a society. They ease life, teach people about far away places and the people who live there, and alow people to talk to others. Computers open doors in the world. Computers help the society a great deal.",6,6,1
5,"Dear @LOCATION1, I know having computers has a positive effect on people. The computers connect families, contain information which is great for peoples education, and are very conveint. Computors are a step into the future and we should take advantage of it. First off the internet or e-mail will help family members connect. My family, which lives @NUM1 hours away by car, love to talk with me by e-mail. This helps me connect with my family and is just another reason why we should have computors. Another reason that includes family is when the family is just sitting around and are calling everywhere just to find a board game, it would just be easier to go online to find it. This way it would be quick and easy to find that one board game. The last reason why a computer would help a family is if a family wants to get in to any kinds of activities and they need the number they could just go online. On the internet the family could find the numbers, the and some information about it. This way more and more families can do activities together. As one can see the computer is bringing more and more families together. An other reason why the computers are good for society is educations. With information at the tip of your fingers more and more people will want to learn. Now a days people try to find the out, but will all the tools on the computers mae people get the education. Secondly computers are another way to go to collage. If you arn't up to going to school/collage because your sick. You wouldn't have to miss anything because with a click of a button you will have the materials needed for what was missed. Lastly everyone knows that in @LOCATION2 most classrooms can't afford one computer. The children want computors so hard. If they were to get one it would change so much. They would be able to learn so much more than before. The children could lean about different countries far away. As a result computers would improve the way we learn. The last reason why computers are so helpful is convience. Now a say the world is crazy, so if we don't have to go out or talk to someone we won't. The computer will offer the ability to confrence will other people so that there would be communication between work parttners. With the ability to talk with another for work would make us a lighter nation. This is only one of the many reasons computers are very conviente, subssiquently computers are conviente because you could book flights, vacations, rentals, and much more. With a click of a button you should be going to @CAPS1 or a nice vacation.",4,4,0

I don't believe computers are a good thing. People spend to much time on them & less time excirsing, enjoying nature & most of all, it's highly dangerous. I don't believe computers are a good thing because people don't excersise like they did. Some people spend @NUM2 out of @NUM3 hours in a daw on computers for others it's there whole life. People spend so much time on computers they lose touch with the outside world. Ever since computers came out, obestity has gone up. all people do is chat to other people & think ""they don't have to know what I look like.""They sit at the computer eating & eating. That's not healthy. I dont think computers are good also because they spend less time enjoying nature. It used to be when I had somoe free time, I could call up a friend & ask them to take a walk with me somewhere & they'd say ""sure! Now they say ""@CAPS1 get on the computers & we can take a virtual walk."" That's not the same as an actual walk with the wind in your face the fresh smell, & all the animals, at least not to be. Nature is a thing of beauty & if you don't enjoy appreciate it, it'll turn into something hideous. Nature used to be the most peaceful think now it the internet. I dont think computers are good because most importantly they're dangerous. Little kids, like myself, think they're grown up & go on computers & meet rapist, murderer, thiefs, all kids of criminals. Also people send hurtful & violent things to each otehr & it yo're on the computer alot of bad people can track you down. Also, the military & @ORGANIZATION1 keeps secrets on computers but if your smart enough you can hack it. Computers aren't safe for anyone or anything. Well, I've told you my main @NUM4 reasons why I think computers aren't such great things, they're not healthy, emotionally or physically. People don't excirse they don't enjoy nature & computers are highly dangerous. All I can do is hope you publish my letter so everyone can see my point of view & make their own decisions. ",4,4,0
315,"Newspaper and Readers, Computers are a very large part of our lives and society. However, there are still people who think that computers do harm. Actually there are many positive effects that computers have on people. Among those effects are ease of communication, ease of gathering information, and ease of find entertainment. Computers have far more positive than negative effects. Computers have made communication easy for people. There are so many different means of communication using the computer, which are all free. For example, instant messaging, @CAPS1-mail video chat, chat rooms, @CAPS2 (and other social networking sites), are all there and help you communicate with friends and family. The positive effect that this has on people is that it allows them to stay in touch with people whom they might not otherwise due to financial or convienency issues. Being social is heathy for people and therefore communication is a positive effect of computers. Information is far easier to aquire when a computer is used. For example, if a kid needed to know about the climate of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4.S for his social studies project, instead of having to get in his moms, drive all the way to the town library, spent time looking for the book, he could just log on to @ORGANIZATION1 and go from there. This is a positive effect on him because it saves him some time and effort. Furthermore much more useful information can be found on the internet as well, such as: flight times, prices, restaraunts, stocks, weather, news, and basically any fact that you need to know. All at these things make having a computer a very positive thing in somebodys life. Computers are a great source of entertainment. In this economy, I know we all could benefit from not having to pay rental fees for movies and big prices for your exams or playstation games. Internet gaming is very amusing and you can find many good games for free. In addition to that, there are websites who offer free movies and television shows to be streamed right to your computer. These things are a great solution to the rising lost of entertainment. Saving money and enjoying good entertainment are both positive effects on people, and both offered by computers. I hope now that readers of this newspaper will now understand how good computers are next time you are for king for a late fee on a libary book or movie, remember that the internet and your computer have offered an alternative.",5,5,1

Computers have a massive affect on some peoples life. Sitting around on the computer all day can be harmful but informative in many ways.

Computers benifits our community by saving paper. It also make our work neater. We can talk to friends and familys. The main reason is that it give computer technians more jobs people need more jobs computer also provide news. say The mayor need to send and iportant message about polluting the water he can do that through email. The main thing today in our society is going green. The only way we can do that is by swiching to computers. We have to chop so many trees down just to get @NUM1 paper to each kid in the grade. Aduts should understand we need to conserve paper. Now I know what your thinking what of we need to print something. My response is that you just could email it to a teach friend or any body else.

All you have to do is type the place you want and boom there it is. There are many benefits to having a computer my final reason is it also give you great hand I cordination. And if you want to be a athe lite than you need lots of it. How the computer gives you hand I coordination is from typeing an moving the mouse. The best way is to play lots of education video games.

People are so busy with computers that they dont even spend quality time with their friends and family anymore. Obesity is also a big issue. Computers are ruining peoples expierence with the great outdoors. Many peope, mostly kids stay inside all day playing video games on computers. Outside there is great things to do like go to the park or play sports. Computers are just taking away from kids and now they dont get to expierence the fresh outside fun and are now a days kids in the @DATE1 stay inside all day, instead of going to fun outside camps. Families now a days are being broken up due to computers. The parents or even kids are not spending lots of time with each other due to the computers. As a result the family starts to lose the bond between each other familys can also develop these ways, youth most likely get attracted to computers, so its either the son or daughter who are not emotionally or physically contacting with the family which is a problem. Health is a big issue when it comes to computers. Whats happening is teenagers or even adults are sitting at the computer playing these games or surfin the web then eating dinner then continueing to surf the web or play the games. After time the starts to become worse and worse and the kids gain weight and keep gaining wait then become obese and unhealthy. This is a problem all over america, that is technology keeps advancing and advancing the youth will become very unhealthy. In conclusion, computers have a very negative affect on people.

737,"Dear (Newspaper), This is a very controversial topic. I am discussing. But on this one, I must say I agree with the experts when they say computers have a negative effect on people. It ruins their social lives, and other bad things. If you spend all your time on the computer, you get no exercise, no fresh air, and you will not get to experience the rest of the world. Not recieving your daily exercise is a big problem. Obesity has already been an issue for millions people in the @LOCATION1 And it is mostly because they eat unhealthy snacks while sitting at the computer the whole day! you want to live a long and healthy life, don't spend all your time having your eyes give to a screen. In adition everyone needs fresh air, right? Going on the computer inside a room is not going to help at all. You need your daily intake of oxygen. Lastly, if you are on long enough, enough, it will become an obsession. Computers already have a bad effect on people all around, and just think about what has just been mentioned. Another problem computers have is that they keep you away from your family and friends. As mentioned before, the social life you had will be gone. With that in mind, people will always see you on the computer, and eventually get sick of you. Computers bring no adventures, just pictures of them. Going out into the real world might be hard, but it is something that should be done. a real life cannot be lived in a dark room with no people or no nature. Haven't you always wanted to travel around the world, see different types of cultures, lifesyles, etc? It gets to the point where computer use should be limite, and living your life should be in place of your free time. Using a computer all day will not let you meet new people, and see new places. You will sbe getting nowhere with a computer screen in your face, so put it away! In conclusion, using computers all the time restrict you from exercising, getting fresh air. Meeting new people, and seeing different places all over. At the end up the day, life is short, so you can't aford to waste it. computers have a negative effect on everbody, and hopefully someday these problems will be changed!",4,4,0
764,"Dear local Newspaper, To my understanding computers have been putting a bad effect on people of all ages. In my opinion staying on the computer all day can cause you to miss out on outdoor activities. Also if you sit on a chair all day, honestly what will happen to you? You will become less active. In past experiences I have learned that if you get interested in computer game it will come very addicting. Computer put negative affects on people of all and I think we should stop and think about what we are doing. Most likely if you stay on the computer all day you will indeed on activities such as sports. @CAPS2 example @PERCENT1 of americans play soccer. In the beatiful fall when the leaves are beatifully changing you will miss out on playing soccer and the beaty of the leaves because of the computer you can't get your eyes off of. Another breathtaking adventure that you @MONTH1 miss out on is hiking. Hiking can be amazing when you get to the top and you see on the houses that have people like you (cach potatoes) sitting inside on the computer. Simple activities can be lost because of an addicting game you call fun. The computer is like a cause and effect. You @MONTH1 think you just playing farm town or chating on facebook, but in feture you will be missing out on the beauty of nature and sports. To connect @CAPS1's with missing out on sports because of the computer that will cause you to become over weight. A recent study showed that @PERCENT2 of children are obeased because of computer games. You @MONTH1 be thinking how, but I have a friend named named, @PERSON1 and he used to love to play out side and play sports until came out @CAPS2 the computer. Now he way @NUM1 pounds and he is only @NUM2. Honestly sitting in a chair all day will cause you to not be active and gain weight. Do you want this to happen to you? Help me tell others how computers cause a negative effect on others. Lastly playing on the compter or chatting with friends on @ORGANIZATION1 can cause you to @CAPS2 example if your talking to your girlfriend in spain who is there @CAPS2 callage I garentee your going to put off school work, @CAPS3 and other @CAPS4 that need to be done. In the end it will end up being time @CAPS2 bed and you got nothing done weather it was because you were trying to get to level @NUM3 or talking with your girlfriend you will have nothing accomplished. If your not yet a resent scientific study reported that six hours on the computer per day @CAPS2 one week can @CAPS5 your vision from a @NUM4 @NUM4 to @NUM6 @NUM6. If you keep it up now it @MONTH1 not seem bad but @NUM8 hours looking at the computer can kill your eyes. Would you rather be blind or not use the computer because or what could happen? All in all the computer is a bad thing such as useful piece of technology can cause you to miss out on events such as sports. Also it leads to being overweight sense your not getting active. Finally the computer is bad @CAPS2 your eyes and can cause you to procastonate. Help me help yourself avoid all of these bad effects caused from the computer.",5,4,1
1410,"Dear @PERSON1, The use of computers is not beneficial to our society. I fear that many kids will suffer from child hood obeasity, this is because of the inactiveness of so many teenagers my age. They @CAPS1 could be enjoying life outdoors and staying active, but they choose to sit infront of a screen all day, everyday. Researchers have proven inactiveness is at large due to many, facebook, mysape and twitter users. These websites are nothing but trouble, other than being unhealthy, teenagers all over are being cyber bullied, to the verge of suicide. Many are not aware of the several pedifiles and creepos these sights carry, which can lead to abduction, rape or worse. By staying active and being outdoors with your friends could save you from these dangers. Go outside run a little, you would be amazed how much a little exercise can help you. Also I firmly believe time should be spent with your family, doing family activities and eating dinner with your parents. By doing this you become closer as a family, and it could help you make healthier choices keep exercise. I believe by following these simple steps, staying active, staying off the computer and spending time with the family. Is much more beneficial than learning how to type, or talking to your friends. Using the computer leads to cyber bulling, and dangerous people, living healthy is the way to be.",4,3,0
968,"Dear @LOCATION1, I think computers are a great tool for everyone if they use it right. Here are my reasons why. First of all, I think computers are good because news travels quickly. Using the internet, world changing news can spread like wildfire and inform everyone in seconds. It is great for staying in the loop and reading about things you need to know. This reminds me of the time when a massive earth quake hit @LOCATION2 and traumatized its citizens. Within moments of the accidents, it was already circling the internet. This brought mass attention to @LOCATION2 which caused many people to donate and needed items. Secondly, the computer is also good for researching topics for school and common interest. If you need facts for a school project you can easily search what you need through the internet wide variety of search engines, you will be able to pin-point exactly what you are also look up things that interest you. If you have a favorite sports team, band, or are interested in a famous figure, you have tons of information on them at your disposal. You can do all of this within the privacy of your on home so you can remain as secret as a @ORGANIZATION1 agent. This reminds me of the time when are of my idols died. Within seconds of hearing the tragic news I was able to search the topic and get an endless uphoria of information regarding his death. Finally, you can chat with someone from around the world if you wanted to! Using social networking sites like facebook and myspace, you can connect with your friends and chat with them for hours on end. You can also enter chatrooms with people who share a common interest with you. Just like how I talk to people about a band we both love. I believe access to news, research, and staying in touch with your friends is without a doubt the best reasons to use a computer. What are you waiting for? Get one!",5,4,1
1364,"I agree with the many peole that but benefits society. Computers can be used as a learning tool, allows communication with distant family and friends. Lastly computers give you something to do in your free time, such as playing games. First of all, I know many people think that others wasted their time on computers. But most computer users us the computer as a tool to learn and get work done. There are many educational websites that people can go to to learn about any subject want. If you want to know more about different cultures such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2. There are websites to tell you everything you wih want to know. Computers also help yet work done. There are multiple programs designed to make writing papers or presenting information much easier @MONTH1 people use these programs to yet ahead in their work and present facts easier by using these programs it is very hard to lose and work that you do because it is all saved into the computer. Next, computers are agreat way for many people to pass some free time. Many websites are designed for this reason. Some allow you to play games and other websites let you watch video made by other people, while some people @MONTH1 spend to much time on this many offers know moderaton and spread their time even other websites hard videos that are used to portray important issues, for example the president has given many through @CAPS4 videos because more often people are on their computers and not watching television. Lastly, computers are a great way to communate with distant firends and family. There are so many ways to do, such as email, or many of the social networking websites. My family being immigrants from another country my family. Thinks this is a vauables tool for talking with our family, and I am sure that htere are many ohters who use the computer this way as well. People also make and keep in touch with great friends through the @CAPS4. I use @CAPS3-mail as a way to keep in touch with many of my friends that I haven't seen in tears, my parents have also found long lost friends that they had before we moved through facebook I also allows people to communate important ideas faster than a letter could. Many scientists use the @CAPS4 to publish ideas and experiments. Finally, I agree with people who sad computers benefits society computers help by being a tool to learn and get work done, pass free time and see important information and lastly computers allow communcation with very far and distant family members.",4,5,0
434,"I think we need our computers. If we dont have competer's we wont be able to connect to our family that could live in anther state or country. I no how there is texting now but some people dont even have phones or nothing how can you connect to them you cant call it might not be free with the phone palan you have. If a family member coms and visits you they would probuly email you about it but if there is no computers they can't tell when there coming. Are they gong do show unispectly they might not even be home and if they show up without them knowing there out of luck. And we exersize on our overtime we pick what time and we do it and if we play a sport were enjoying nature some people might have job's that take place outside of if. There are nerd's that are on computers all day long but in sure they enjoy nature I dont know about exersizing but they have a car and every thing they drive and things. Also, about the exersizing every on has to exersize to stay in shape im pretty sure people dont want to be fat there whole life they want to look good and feel good about there self. If it is a holiday or something and people want to send them something to wish then of whetever holiday it is. There not gonna be able to see them in person if they live so far away inless they plan to meet each other but even if they do that there gonna want to email then not call were it costs money and texting only comes with sertain plan's of phones so all there is left is emailing. Sometimes, people will more fron of you that your ollways on the computer if your not dont worry at least you get to email your family that you dont ever seen. These reasons are my opinion that dont get rid of computers and other things.",4,3,0
1206,"Dear editor @ORGANIZATION2 the source, @CAPS1, I have noticed that many people have been spending too much time using their computers. This is something that needs to stop because it imports peoples health, safety and education. To open my statements, overuse @ORGANIZATION2 the computer con lead to poor health. Take my friend @PERSON1 for example. He sits at home on his computer all @DATE1 and plays games, goes on @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. He rarely gets any excersize and he almost never sees daylight. @PERSON1 @LOCATION1 gained @NUM1 pounds, which lead to obeisity and heart problems. He even wears wooden teeth because his general hygene declined as well. Another common health problem that developes from excessive use @ORGANIZATION2 the computer is arthrietis. Dr. @PERSON3 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION1 told @ORGANIZATION3, ""The massive amounts @ORGANIZATION2 typing on the keyboard can lead to joint problems, arthrietis, and other joint related problems."" In fact, a study that took place from @DATE2 to @DATE3 to see the long lasting terms @ORGANIZATION2 computer overuse had some shocking results. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION2 the test subjects saw doctors from problems with joint pain. These health risks are a concern, but peoples safety is on bigger issue. When people excessively use the computer they put their safety and well being at risk. People have had serious injuries and scams placed on them because @ORGANIZATION2 the internet. In @DATE4, a girl named @PERSON5 was kidnapped and taken to @LOCATION2. She met a man on @CAPS4.com named @PERSON6, who persuaded her into meeting him at an airport. From their she was taken to @CAPS5 and held from ransom. Every time people use their computer, they put themselves at risk. Dr. @PERSON4 @ORGANIZATION2 the @ORGANIZATION2 claims, ""I @NUM2 @ORGANIZATION2 internet-related kidnappings & other crimes. The victim was a person who overused the computer and frequented the internet. Safety is one @ORGANIZATION2 the most important things in life. But peoples education is also effected. When people overuse the computer they can impact their education. The internet hold false information and can be a waste @ORGANIZATION2 peoples time. When students are working on a report, they very often use the internet to get information. Websites like @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION4 are most commonly used. This can be a big problem. Did you know that @PERCENT2 @ORGANIZATION2 information on the internet is wrong? Thats more than half @ORGANIZATION2 it! The internet can also be a time waster. My bro, @PERSON2, had on assignment to do @DATE1. He stood up @NUM3 hours using @CAPS2 and didn't even write his essay. He recieved a zero on that grade. In closing, overusing your computer can cause health problems, put your safety at risk, and hurt your education.",6,5,1

They cost a lot of money cause people to stop exercising and become unhealthy, and teach children that things come easy in life. Computers cost a lot of money. Between buying one, purchasing hardware and protection, and paying for maintanence, they are very expensive. Dr. @PERSON2, a computer science expert, claims, ""The average computer costs @MONEY1. There is then hardware that needs to be bought and replaced, along with antivirus programs and other protection. Now we could be talking about @MONEY2 at the very least. With yearly maintanence costing about @MONEY3 per year, you can see how expensive these machines really are."" @CAPS1 out of every ten computer owners in a recent survey stated that they had to service their computers within the last three months. Thats a lot of many going toward fixing computers. But computers don't just cause money problems, there are health issues too. Computers take a lot of time away from people. When a computer is used, the user doesn't move around or exercise. Computers are making people unhealthy. The obesity number in the @LOCATION1 has skyrocketed, but it's not just food, Some experts are now contributing computer use to lack of exercise, and therefore, obesity. Dr. @DR1 @CAPS2 says, ""@CAPS3 matter what you're doing on a computer, be it games or education, you would be better off outside, moving around, getting exercise. A recent study shows that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 families who purchased a computer in the last year have halved their exercise and play time. There are health problems created by computers, but they also teach the next generation that things come very easily. Computers are an excellent source of knowledge, but that could be a problem. It is a quite easy to find something out, or research a topic using a computer. Before computers became popular, people had to work and look for @CAPS4. Now that it is so easy, children @MONTH1 begin to think things come easily in life. @PERSON1, a pediatric psycologist, says, ""The mind of a child works in a such a way, that most things they encounter are absorted and become normal.

If they are not he @MONTH1 become frustated and not be able to do what is needed."" @NUM3 out of @NUM4 poll takers agree that finding @CAPS4 on the computer is quite easy. What are the children of the world being taught? Life is easy, a false statement. Computer use is a growing problem. It costs ridiculous amounts of money, causes health problmes, and poisons the minds of children to believe that life is an easy thing. Computers are bad for the people of the world, they take our money, our health and the minds of our children.",6,6,1
205,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1, my name is @PERSON1. I've just been informed about how people view computers and the effects of them. In my opinion, I find computers to be a very negative influence on yound kids, teens, and adults. Many harmful awarenesses come along with having one. For one thing, people being so hypnotized in this electronical device are finding lesser time to excercise and take care of themselves. Also to, the only nature they're experiencing is pictures online and not enjoying the full beuty of what we have left of out earth. Another negative outcome is that they start becoming more and more distant from their loved ones. What happened to our society? Why can't we think on our own anymore? I truely, strongly hope that what i'm saying will change the minds of some people. Thank you very much. Exercise is a very key aspect in anyone's life. Especially growing kids and teens. On the computer what exercise benefits are you getting? Stronger fingers? A higher chance of syndrome @CAPS10.

With global warming by ourside, what you saw yesterday @MONTH1 not be there today. Breathing in some fresh, natural air can really calm a stressed child out. What ever happened to playing an endless scoth with side walk chalk and fresh? or tag or just running around? Is it not cool anymore? Yah, not cool to take care of yourself. Inspire yourself by writing poems about how you feel or draw a screnary. Now a days, instead of @CAPS10 climing a tree, were climbing our mouse arrow to the next website. There's so much that we all take for granted, that one day when you look back on ti all, youre going to really miss those @DATE1 days. Family time is so critical in anyone's life. Without a family, you're nothing. When did game night or family time disapear? Just because we're in a society that says computers are completely normal everyday thing in a house, doesn't mean you family and friends aren't a main priority to you anymore. If you want to hangout a friend's house, dont email about it, walk @CAPS2 there and get the full affect since when does a computer a family? Never. If we got out of a fake reality, @CAPS10 there wouldn't be negativity in our life. @CAPS10 you can regain a true life back with them. @CAPS10 you'd think more clearer just @CAPS10. Whats makes a computer any better than life? Nothing ask yourself that. So inconclusive, I strongly believe that with this in you lives we've actually get dumber. There's more negative than positives in having a computer. Sure you could quickly send them a message or like @CAPS9, but is it ever bad to do the good old fashion calling? Or sendin letter? I say again, thank you for taking out your time to read this. @CAPS10 i changed you, @CAPS10 not. Whatever you do, think about the next time you're online and see what happends. ",5,5,1
956,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 opinion on computers is that they have a positive affect on people. I think this because I know some people that excersise and go on the computer mainly, I don't think computers are a bad thing. Some people learn on computers. They learn how to exercise. Sure some people just chat and learn about that far away place they could go there and explore the buety and nature. I think computers are great effects on people, They help out a lot. I know @CAPS2 uncle that came from @LOCATION1 he learned how to speak english of the computer. He learned a lot and we were all proud. Some effects that computers have on people are a lot. People have classes online they go to @CAPS3 mothers that are single that have kids for example, they get their diplomas and degrees of the computer online. And theirs other @CAPS3 @CAPS2 aunts and uncles they go to english classes online and work. A lot of people have classes online. @CAPS3 i go on @PERSON1 all the time all the time. @CAPS4 teaches me how to type. @CAPS4's fun, but also educated. I think that all computer have positive effects on people. All of them should their should'nt be one computer with negative effects on people. But that's only by @CAPS2 opinion. Computers are @CAPS3 robots they do lots for us. We type reports, learn, read online. And then theres also were we play games online, and educated games. I believe that their are lots of resources. You could search up a lot of stuff. For example you could search up: mistery, animals, natures and places. You wouldn't beleive how many results the computer has. So who would have negative effects of the computer. All @CAPS4's trying to do is help us and out education @CAPS4 helps me with @CAPS2 spanish sometimes. So why would people think that computers arn't good ideas? Computers are great for everything. I could go on and see what the weather is for tommorrow. Also I could see what the news are, and i could contact @CAPS2 teachers through the computer. I think a computer would always have a positive affect on people.",5,4,1
427,"To: The @ORGANIZATION1 can be a big part mof people's lives, however, some don't realize the negative effect these pieces of technology have. First, staring at a computer screen is unhealthy for your body. Secondly, anyone can post information on a website, therefore, it can be inaccurate. Lastly, people tend rely on computers too much. Computers are negatively impacting our society! The first reason why clearly, computers are not benefiting people is because they can cause unhealthy symptoms. For example, if you are playing games on the computer for hours, it can strain your eyes. This can cause you to feel tired and drowsy after being on the computer. Also, statistics show that @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 own computers. Could this be the cause of obesity in @LOCATION1? Computers could very well be restricting people from wanting to go outside and excercising to maintain a healthy lifestyle and weight. Computers are obviously unfit for our bodies in many ways. Have you ever wondered if the information on a website is completely accurate and true? I know I have. Anyone who has access to a computer can post information on a blog, website, or communication site (such as twitter, facebook, or myspace). Not everyone who posts articles is an expert on that topic; the information could very well be false! More and more @CAPS1 use computers to get the information they need, which could, in the long run, be hurting them. Books are much more accurate! They have to be revised by editord, and are written by people who definitely know what they're talking about! Therefore, computers are, without-a-doubt, hurting our nation because of false facts. Lastly, computers have a negative effect because we rely on them too much! For example let's say you are writing a paper on the computer that is due tomorrow. You save it, and then close down the computer because you have to go eat dinnder. Later, you come back to the laptop to find that your paper isn't there anymore! You look all over your folders; but it's gone. Computers always have technical glitenes, but you don''t always have time to go to the tech help store to fix it. However, if you had written out the paper, it wouldn't have randomly disappeared! @CAPS4 people depend on computers too much, it can backfire and cause a @CAPS3 problem for you. My sixth grade teachers once said, ""@CAPS4 I was in college, I had a big french paper due. I worked hard all night to get it done. Then, @CAPS4 I went back to print it, it had been erased. I had to rewrite the whole thing again!"" Computers have a big negative effect on society because we tend to depend on them too much. In conclusion, computers are hurting our society, clearly, they are unhealthy for our bodies. Also, the information on the computers internet might be naccurate. Lastly, we rely on computers too much, which leads to problems. I strongly believe we should recluce our dependence on computers! ",6,5,1
690,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, I believe that computers do benefit society. People are able to read, shop, and play online. This makes life easier for many people. Buying books that you would like to read can get expensive. With the internet, people are able to read almost any book right on their computer. In a recent survey, it was found that people who read books online save an additional @MONEY1 a year more than people who buy books. People can also read things like newspaper online. If there is snow on the ground, and people are unable to get their newspaper, they can read it online. This way they will know if a newspaper is still good, and continue buying it, including the @LOCATION1 @CAPS1. Additionally, people are able to shop online. Sometime, someone @MONTH1 have been an accident injuring them, and they are stuck at home. If it is a child, their parents will be unable to go to the store because they will be caring for the child. They can simply go on the computer and have food and other necessities delivered to them. People can also do this if they have a busy lifestyle with work or school. @PERSON1, a physician, told me that people who shop online have @PERCENT1 less stress than people who go to the store for the same items. He said that is is because they do not need to worry about taking much time out of their schedule to shop. Moreover, the computer is a good way to quictly play games. Young children can be very loud and energetic. Parents can just let them play games and read on the computer. Little kids love just the fact of being on the computer, and letting them go on can keep quiet and occupied for a while. Even just typing is interesting for younger kids. For older kids, there are many games that can play. Action, strategy, puzzles, and many more. They can also play against people around the world. The computer is fun for everyone. So in conclusion the computer is a very good place to go shopping, read books, and play games. Computers greatly help families of today.",5,4,1
1740,"I think computers have a good effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordiantion, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and allow them to talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. This will be used through out people lives. WIthout hand-eye coordination people will be clumsey. Hand-eye coordination is used from day to day everyday. Using a computer you have to look at the screen and type at the same time. For people who do not have good hand-eye coordiantion this will be a big help. They will be able to do more thing without messing up. Like hitting a baseball! For kids who want to play sports this could acually help. They will learn to use there eyes, arms, and hands to there advantage. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places. If we did not have this ability we will not be able to know what is going on around the world. Also if you have family in a faraway place you will be able to look online and see what is happening there. If something bad has happened you will know this and will be able to help them. Also to be able to learn about faraway places will help in school. If you have a report to do on of faraway place instead of looking through you can look on the internet for information. Computers also allow people to talk online with other people. This gives more comunication. You will be able to make more friends and better friends. To have the opportuniy to talk to people online is great. You can learn about someone and become friends and hang out a lot. Also you will become a lot more interactive with people. If you are a shy person this can help you. You will get used to talking to people and when you get comfortable you will talk to them in real life. This will make you a lot more friends. This will help you come out of your shell and become a lot more interactive around people. These are three reasons why I think computers are a good thing. They help hand-eye coordination give the ability to learn about faraway places and allow you to talk online with other people.",4,4,0
1595,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 opinion on the effects computers have on people is they help make every day life easyier. First off, you can chat with people from long distances. Also, it makes home work, and finding information a lot easyier as well. Last but not least when you have nothing else to do, you can play games, and watch videos from online. One of the best things about computers is going online and chatting with @CAPS1 friends. Even if the are across the country, you can still chat with them, for free! Also, if you can't get in touch with them, you can send them a @CAPS2-mail, and as soon as they log on, they will get your message. Best of all, when you forget to write your home work down, you can go online, and ask one of your friend what it was. Besides talking to people, you can do your homework on a computer as well. All you have to do is make a word document, and type with the keys. Let me just say this is a lot better than having to write with a pencil. Not to mention, typing a paper is a lot neater. Also, if you are doing a report on something, all you have to do is look it up on the internet, and you'll get endless information about it, all on your computer! Last but not least, you can play games on your computer. Whenever someone is bored doing nothing they can just turn on a computer, and play their favorite game. Not only is it fun, but it teaches hand-eye coordination as well. Some people say they don't have the money for games, but little do they know, there are millions of free online games, that any age can play. This is great on a boring day when you have nothing else to do. In summary, the effects computers have on people is they help make everyday life easyier. You can chat with people from long distances, and it even makes home work much easyier to complete. Not to mention it has fun games for people to play when there bored, or have nothing to do. I strongly belive that computers have a positive effect on people, because of all the things they offer, and help us on. Thank you.",4,4,0

Another big issue is that people are over useing the computer. Once you learn to moderate the useige of your computer that wont be a problem. Some people say computers cost too much. There are ways to pot so called ""down payments"" on computers, something like a but you pay each month and setting up internet is easy as @NUM1. So, yes there are good and bad things talked about computers but without them we wouldn't have a modern era.

Many people don't excerise for only @NUM2 min. But when you are distracted on your computer aming or facebooking you forget to excrise or just go it for @NUM3 min.

However, the computers is mak fun and less woris. Therefore, your more willing to go on computer then excrise. Computers make it hand to excrise because your less into thinking how to this right and take you the because your thinking about a computer game, you played facebook, email and bunch more things on computer.

However there re stuffy room with sholves a desk and some picture that's the serey the people got when @MONTH1 are on the computer all the time. People are missing out on enjoying nature little and big beatities. People comuter aren't walking on beach on taking a nice long hike in woods dad not taking a stroll in a ark these are missing out on getting some fresh air and seeing the senery nature has to offer us. Instead they are sitting chair starring at a computer screen. However, pretty could that be compared to enjoying nature beatity? Computers are testing away people enjoying nature. Hanging-out with friends are family is a fun thing to @CAPS1 but how are you suppose to long out with them if your to the computer? They aren't going to internet with their friends or family. This could affect their future they could grow up sad and lonely aren't know how to act around people they get job their works around people. The people who are addicted to computer are missing out an doing something fun with some they lose or enjoy to be around. Computers could be people far away friends but how about instead call that friend on. They probably rather hear wire then. See a message so computers interesting with friends and family. Now, that you know how had the computers affect people you can understand why I'm computers. They cut in the peoples the excrise, and have people not enjoying nature. people want hang out with friends and famlies. So hopefully you can see what a bad affect computers have.",4,4,0
1138,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1. There has been lots of talk and arguments about computers and wether they benefits the society. I belive it does benefit society. One reson is because you can communicate with others. Another reson is theirs many things to do on these computers or even the world wide web. Haveing computers is always handy. You can talk or web chat with friends. This one time online I found my old friend from @LOCATION1, that I havened seen in five years. Whenever I come home from school I'll go on the computer and talk to all my friends. The computers a great place to make plans or to catch up with some buddies. My next reson for why they benifit society is theirs so much to do. It's like an at home amusment park. The internet is a wonderfull thing. either to do home work or play games. even some @ORGANIZATION1 I'll just sit down for two or three hours and just play a game. But, i still exercise daily. yes, computers can get addicting but, its always good to go outside and exersise. Many people say over @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS1. population has a computer, and @PERCENT2 check email or go on the computer every ten minutes. yes its not heathy but its their dissition. In conclution I belive computers are indeed benifical. I have stated many resons why. such as, They are great for communication or @CAPS2 up with some friends, also theirs an infinint amount of things to do. So if you don't have a computer go out and get one. They will be worth your wild.",4,4,0
1160,"Dear local newspaper, I believe computers have a good effect on people. The reasons believe that is because the computer teaches us a lot of things, you can also find a relitive you have not seen in a long time. Two more reasons is because you could talk to your friends, another is you need it to put music on @NUM1's, @CAPS1's and other devices. My first reason I thought computers have a good effect on people was because it teaches us alot of things. If you wanted to know about a countries culture you will be able to go and find out on the computer. Without the computer you would have to visit not knowing what shot to take for sickness they have. Other things it could teach you is how to get from one place to another without stopping to ask people where a place is. It's important to know things on on the computer you can look it up and find out. Another is you can find a family member you haven't seen in along time. Being able to reconnect with someone is very important. What if something happened to them and you didn't know, like a broke leg or hip you can find out if you find them on the computer. Also alot of people @MONTH1 have family they miss and want to be close to or talk to again they cannot find them and fill close to them again. And they can find you if they relly need to talk to you. You could also talk to your friends in a chat room with other friends or alone. If you have moved far away the computer is a good way to keep in touch with your old friends. Talking to a friends releaves some kids of their stress they had. It helps when your friends make you laugh and talk to you about leaving everything alone and breath. Everyone has one friend that talks them out of doing bad things. A friend like that is helpful. Last reason is you need a computer to put music on your @NUM1 players. Music is very fun and alot of people love to listen to it. If you had no computers there would be no point in buying a lot of electronic devices because a lot you need the computer for. People like to listen to music on their @CAPS1 or @NUM1 while exercising but you need the computer to put music on it. Without computers their's no point of music. In conclusion I think computers have a good effect on people.",4,4,0
1134,"Dear sir, I belive that computers are great for society. There are lots of benefits to having a computer to use. You can talk to people online with instant message, it is a lot more dependable than a telephone or cell phones. Lots of time people don't answer thhe phone when you need them. With a computer you can send a message from the computer to the persons cellular device. You can lern a lot from a computer, suc as things about the world, people around the world, yo can lern things from the internet youre teacher can't even teach you. Then you can study and expand youre knolage. It is a problem if your on the computer more than you exersize but with techology today you can get exersize wile useing a computer. You can play music from it while you workout, of what moivie while running on a tredmill. Even though people go on the computer to much ways to exersize and use the computer at the same time. So there is ups and downs but in the end, it dosen't matter how much you use the computer, you can get exersize at the same time thats why I think it is a benifits to have computers today.",3,3,0

But sometimes we don't have to be on the computer so long. That @CAPS1 why I think computers are a good thing. Without computers it will be different because you have to talk to people on the phone or text message. In my opinion I am really thankful that we have computers. And on computers you could go on everything like @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and even work on the computer. That @CAPS1 without computers it will be different. I think people are not spending to much time on the computer"", because a lot of people on the computer to do office work. Computer make things a lot easier for us!

237,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, I am writing this letter to state my opinion on the effects computers have on people. And there are three of them: @CAPS4 theft, cyberbully, addition. Now I will write one paragraph about each. My first reason why I feel that computers have bad effects is. @CAPS4 theft many people in the @CAPS5.S.A identities get stolen for listing private information online (computer) which can leave that person in a lot of debt. How are we going to encourage people to use computers when their at the risk of getting their @CAPS4 stolen. If this happening to innocent people it needs to stop we must'nt encourage this online behavior so say no to computers. i understand it really is interesting to learn about people from different countries but their are some cons. Talking online to people you don't know and have never seen, met in person they can pose as someone famous and bully you for their enjoyment. It has been proven that when children even adults get cyberbullied can lead them in the path of depression even suicide. Now I find it quite febble-minded to give up your life for a computer. So again I say no to computers. My last reason why I say no to computers is because people become addicted to the excitement of the computers when eventually lead to the division from friends and family because your lost in the computer world also you forget about you hygene some people even forget to eat. This thing they call computer is a drug, a drug that makes you forget about reality and everything else you used to think of and bring you to computer land. And I say no to computers. I have gave you my opinion and three supporting reasons why I feel the way I do which were because @CAPS4 theft, cyberbullying, addiction. Say no @NUM1 computers.",4,4,0
411,"Dear @CAPS1 of my local newspaper, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. These boxes can be harmful to their users' eyes. In addition, they lead to less interaction with Â“realÂ” people. Finally, they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. Computers are harmful to our society. For starters, computers are harmful because they are very bad for our eyes. Between the @DATE1 @DATE2 and @DATE3, doctors saw nearly a @PERCENT1 increase in eye problems that resulted in either surgery, glasses, or contacts. This can be directly associated with the overuse of personal computers. Also, studies have shown that common citizens who use these cootraptions for over four hours each day end up with an extremely deteriorated vision by the age of @NUM1. Finally, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 stated that overuse of computers have led to a very negative affect on the eyesight of their workers. It can be seen, how work gets done faster, however the cost of medical treatments actually surpasses the little extra profit gained by modernizing. Secondly, computers are harmful because they lead to less time being with Â“realÂ” people. To begin with, studies have shown that people simply donÂ’t learn as much about their peers by talking to them through a box. Also, a study by the @ORGANIZATION1 has shown that there are roughly @PERCENT2 fewer conversations at social gatherings than just @DATE1. This is alarming because at that rate people @MONTH1 never get to know each other and the world @MONTH1 become an electronically based workspace. Finally @PERSON1, social relations professional, stated that people end up with a lack of understanding when they canÂ’t feel the emotion a person has when he/she is speaking. Sure, you can video chat, but that still does not convey the real feeling behind a personÂ’s words. Finally, computers are harmful because they lead to a very unhealthy lifestyle. To begin with, the lack of fresh air obtained by sitting indoors all day is very bad for lungs and can lead to premature breathing problems. Also, average people get @PERCENT3 fewer workouts, according to @CAPS4Â’s @CAPS5, which was not likely directly influenced by overuse of computers. Finally the obesity rate has risen from next to nothing to over @NUM2 in the past ten @DATE1. Research showed that the majority of the obese patients spent excessive time on their little boxes of ten. While you might feel that this is not completely due to computers, it has been proven time and time again that these machines are the main reason behind the worldÂ’s currently unhealthy lifestyle. Personal computers have a very negative effect toward the society of today. This technology has resulted in very poor eyesight in the general public. In addition, they lead to a much lower amount of social interaction. Finally, they end up forcing people into an unhealthy lifestyle. So, let the word out that computers are bad for society, and try to make the world a better place to live.",6,6,1
1519,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that people are spending to much time on there computers and not exercising as they're supouse to do every day. @CAPS5 @CAPS3 says that @PERCENT1 of all people in the intere world are spending to much time on the @CAPS3 and not enjoying nature. So they don't get exercis like other people do. @CAPS5 @CAPS4 says that people that go out side and not stair at there computers will live a long and helthy life. I say that @PERCENT2 of all people that are always on the @CAPS3 often go blind and will never see who the world is changing awound them. I say that @PERCENT3 of all people that don't always go on the @CAPS3 will live a better life then the people that are always on the @CAPS3. My @CAPS5 told me that you should go on the @CAPS3 just not for a very long time because beeing on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not so good for you so don't go on the @CAPS3 for a very long time only for a short amount of time and don't go on the @CAPS3 every day only like @NUM1 time a week. People that have @CAPS6 book acounts you shouldn't go on it like every day go on like @NUM1 to @NUM3 time a week because going on the @CAPS3 for a very long time is not good for people. My @CAPS5 @CAPS8 says that @PERCENT4 of all people in the world have @CAPS9 and ofthen go blind because of them using the @CAPS3 all the time and that if you go on it for to long your @CAPS3 will mealt down and brake.

Students can use a computer to do a research paper for lets say history. You can find anything about anybody or anything on a computer that has internet on it. Theres also a cool thing that is found on some computers its called microsoft word. It lets you right anything you want and if you mess up a word you can fix it if you wanted to.

861,"Dear Newspaper, I know the debate on wether computers benifit soscity is greatly debated but to me the answer is odvious. The internet is an extreamly useful invention, used in all schools and is only inconvient when misused. I'm not saying that its @PERCENT1 nessary for every house to contain one, but that its a luxay most people have. The computer and internet combination is probally one of the most genis ideas ever thought up. It is basically any information in a click. Websights such as myspace and facebook allow you to connect and reconnect with friends old and new. Also the ability to create your own web page is greatly useful when trying to promote a bisnuess or company. Not only that but the internet also makes it possible to purchace clothes online without having to go to the store. I know thats useful for those parents, like many that hate driving to the mall. Second, I can garentuee you that almost every school in the country has a working computer with accessable internet. The computer was just one huge leap forward for eduication. These are many websights with a eduicationly purpose only. These are websights like this for children and adults of any age. Many teachers now adays are assinging homework where the internet is nessary. Also tests such as the blue ribbon test are taken online. I can tell you right now that mant teachers would be torn apart without the compluter. Lastly, one of the most important issues. The downsides of the internet. Even though myspace and facebook are ment for good they also have a dark side.",4,4,0
1076,"To the editor of the @ORGANIZATION2, I am writing to state my opinion as to whether computers benefit or harm society. I believe that computers are a great tool for several reason. First, computers are a learning resource, and a way people stay updated with the world around them. Also, computers keep us connected with friends and family more easily. Clearly, computers are more helpful to people than they are harmful. Life as we know it today would be greatly altered without the advances in computer technology that have been made over the past few decades. Today if I need to know something, whether it be for @ORGANIZATION1 or my own reason I can almost instantly look it up and get answers from many different sources. This helps people to be more educated and updated with the world around them. Dr. @PERSON2 from @ORGANIZATION1 recently preformed a study on high @ORGANIZATION1 teenagers and concluded that, ""@CAPS1 with access to computers scored signficantly better on standard testing due to background information they have accquired while on line"". Along with the internet, there are programs such as @ORGANIZATION4, and @ORGANIZATION3, which help people to learn a new language, or write on the computer. Also, computers keep us updated with events that are happening in the world. For example, when the earthquake devestated @LOCATION1, I first saw it on the news, but got very few details. I the looked it up on line and imediatly get the death toll, the aid that was being given, and ways I could help donate. Without computers, I would have known none of this. Another reason as to why computers are so helpful to society is that they are tools that help us to keep in touch with others. With things like facebook and @CAPS2, I can chat with people, invite friends over, and even plan parties. Without computers, I would need to call each person individualy, but with computers I can write one message and send it to everyone all at once. This gives me more time to do things like play outside and exercize. Also, things like @CAPS3 and face book help people to stay in touch with old and distant friends. Studies done by @ORGANIZATION5 show that @PERCENT1 of people with some type of social networking account have a more active social life than those who do not according to doctor @PERSON1 this means that these people will have an easier time adapting to different social situations than these who do not. Clearly, this is a great benefit. In conclusion, the computer helps society a great deal more than it hinders it. It easily allows people to stay educated, updated, and connected. It helps people stay aware of the world around them and educated about everything. It makes things that would other wise take lots of time very quick, giving people the chance to do other things such as playing outside. It keeps people socialy capable and active, and allows people to connect with others. Without a doubt, computers are a very good thing.",5,5,1
598,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 you ever just wanna go out side and play a game of football with the ones you love? Well I know I @CAPS2. I believe that almost @PERCENT1 of kid are on the computer @NUM1 because they have nothing to @CAPS2 or it is addicting. The reson that I belive in this strongly true stament. That people are consurnet about how much time people spend on the computer and not with ther familys. One important fact about kid being on the comuter is how dangours it can be. Now a days kids don't relize how dangours being online can be for example I rember a time when my cousin said that he went to the movies to meat up with some girl he meat on myspace but all he saw was a, balet hewdet, sex ofender. That told him he was the one talking to him online. That he wanted my cousin to go over his house and play x-box and my cousin screamed hell no and leaft to my house cause the movie theater wher closer to my house. Know being safe is important. Would you rater have your children safe with you or with some stranger? Computer can also be helpful at time when needed for school or you job. Only people would think its fun to home and go on the computer for no reason. Second of an dont you want to spend time with children before they go to college or some thing? Just the littlest thing like playing a game of football will affect them to create a better with you and you chiled. Some thing you can @CAPS2 to get them to go out side with you is take the computer away for a week and have fun with your child. Play some of his/her favorite sports. So with the computer computer. without a bond with you and you chiled. So the time has come to make a let your kid be lazy on the computer and get into or go have fun with them?",4,4,0
170,"There are some effects computers have on people that I agree with and disagree with. There are many people in the world that use computers every day and some that use it sometimes. Also it always gives you information everytime you use it. I would think that computers give a positive effect on people. Computers can have their likes and dislikes. Not everytime when you need information the computer won't give it to you. There are some websites that give you the right stuff you want to know and others do not fill your mind with positive things. That is one thing I do not like about computers. Do not think that is too bad because computers have alot more fun adavantages. One of the most common and used thing around the world is instant @CAPS7. Instant @CAPS7 is when you are communicating with another human bean over the online web. Many people use this to get in touch with a close family members or a friend. There are some names for instant @CAPS7 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4-mail, and many more! Yes, the computer can be very addicting but once in a while you need to get off and maybe get some fresh air. For some people I agree that they stay on the computer to much and became very lazy. This is one disadvantage that can cause you from exercizing and seeing friends and family. There is no problem if you go on for an hour a day maybe more, but to long is not good. There are so many things for the computer I can't name them all @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS7, and even buying things off the computers, those are many of the things you can do on your computer. I love going on the computer time to time doing many things I have talked about. Also if you do have one than reading this @MONTH1 persuade you into getting one.

I think that some people are not getting enough exercise and I also think that you can get lazy on the computer is bad too. @CAPS1 three reasons for @CAPS1 opinion is @NUM1. People are not getting enough exercise, @NUM2. People get lazy and changes while being on the computer an mount of time, @NUM3. They will get addicted to the computer. The first reason is because people are not getting enough exercise I pick that reason because people I know gain a lot of weight and it's kinda of sad because they do nothing but stay on the computer and eat. Another detail is that the computer messes up your eyes by staring at that type of screen. One time I did that and @CAPS1 eyes felt weird after getting on the computer. The third detail was that people gets very fragile and weak. I picked that detail because if you get up off the computer and exercise your bones will become weak. The second reason is because people will become lazy and changes for an example people will keep asking you to get stuff and do stuff for them and you would do it because you be a good friend. The second detail is that the person will change, the person will be lazy to go to fun events with you as a freind. The next thing you you wont have a freind anymore. The third detail is that it's like your bestfriend has replaced you for a computer that hurts if a person you know for a long time has replaced you for a computer thats something that will make you depressed and make you wanna commit suicide too me anyways. The third reason is because the person will get addicted to the computer for an example you want to celebrate a birthday and the person says ""first I got to beat this level."" @CAPS2 the person saying that the person is not going to get off the computer. Another detail is that his day will go pass fast and thats like waisting days of life and people who died will do anything to get their life and to waist is not good. The third detail is you will began to hate the person because the person dosen't care about anything but the computer.

1387,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 we all know more and more people are using computers. Some believe that this would be a concern because it affects peoples health. I believe that with the advances in technology it would give us positive effects on people. Here are three reasons why, first would be that with advances in tech. It would teach us to be more intelligent. Second would be it it would give us the ability to have access to intresting things we can't get at the library like biographics and finally access to communicate online. My first reason @CAPS2 I mentioned before was it would give us intelligence. If we have questions to something we dont know we could search on the computer and find our answer. We would learn this and would be able to teach others. The computer can give us alot of useful information that can benefit us in the future. My second reason is that advance in tech. would help us because it give us access to helpful website that teaches us. Not all information is found in the library the computer has access to biographics educational website and most important the access to educational advances for example online tutoring for students with difficulties in school. My third and final reason why advance in tech. would and could benefit us is that it gives us access to online communication. Some people will have e-mail for good reason for example teachers have e-mail for educational cause if a student is having problem in work, the student simply send the teacher a e-mail of the what the students difficulty is and what the student can do. That is all I have to say for now. I hope you think about this",3,4,0
352,"Dear @CAPS1, Experts agree that people go outside and exercising because their are three reason why people should go outside and there are: people don't have a lot of exercising, they can hang out with their friend and family, and people and kid should enjoying the outsid nature.

Also, parents and kids who spend all day on their computer or laptop can be over weight. Kids these day, have hard time to exercising because there are over weight by staying on their computer and play their computer game.

246,"Dear editor, Have you ever would to know something so badly that you can't focus on anything else? Have you ever tried to find that information and had an""ah-hah!"" moment? What did you use to search for this knowledge? You probably used a computer. All you need to do is type in your request, hit "" enter"" and viola! Your screen fills with choices of information sites. Computers help so many people with everyday questions. Our country has gotten smarter because of computers. You can converse with friends that have moved across the state, country, or even world. At every click of your mouse there are new things to learn. You can even use the computer for your personal enjoyment. Computers have opened up so many opportunities the world needs to lake. When I was four years old, my best friends at the time moved to florida. I was devastaded. At first, we tried writing letters to each ohter. Then, as we grew older and became busier and busier, or connection with each other halted. As technology and computers have advanced, my friend and I text, e-mail, and instant message each other all the time. It has made our long distance friendship easier and closer. Because of computers, you can communicate with friends you thought were long-lost. You can also meet new people with one of the many sites available. How would you like to talk with someone all the way down in @LOCATION2? World communication has also opened up many business opportunities. Since the economy is failing, computers will open job spaces, help college students study for their futur career, and hopefully help to improve the lives of many people. Communication is needed for many things to make our world better for generations to came. Instead of going to a noisy arcade, why not play exciting games right in the privacy of your. Any game you can think can probably be found on the @CAPS1. From a simple game of solitare to an advanced level of shift, games for any age and difficulty level can be found. New, some people @MONTH1 think that all kids are going to do is sit in front of the computer and play games. There are going to be some peole that will refuse to go outside, spend time with their friends or just read outside. There will definitely be some people like that. I can't help it. What we can do is all those that refuse to go outside to do so. I know many people who spend and budget their time wisely and still have a great time. We can also encourage kids to use exercise programs on their computers and video games to improve their health. There are many fun and games that help you to be a better and healthier person while still having fun. The computers we have in our homes right now are equipped with so much information that if you tried to take it all in are you would be overwhelmed. @ORGANIZATION1, a popular search engine, gives you the power to look up anything you could ever wait to know from the vice president's birthday to the price of eggs in @LOCATION4 to how wide the @LOCATION1 is can all be found with the click of a button. this knowledge helps with homework assignments incredibly. Most reference books are out of date and information is inaccurate, but computers are updated so frequently, you have all the facts all the time. I think our country has gotten much smarter because of computers. So whether you want to talk to your long-lost friend in @LOCATION2 or talk to an expert on osprey in @LOCATION3, you can find your answer on the computer. While you're at it, play a couple exciting games and learn about the best movies ever released in @DATE1. Have fun and learn lots!",5,6,1

For example my uncle helps file takes computer to make sure all of the files get saved and they are in the light places. Imagine all of the papers and space he would use if he had to do by hand or didnt use a computer. Computers also help teachers. Teachers enter grades, e-mail parents, and even create test or quizes and they know it will be nice and organized in the computer files instead of in paper files on their desk. Speaking of quizzes that teachers make on the computer, they can also make alot of other things like power points. Power points can help them put alot of information on the screen and it helps the students learn, which is a positive effect. If you had a small business that just started out you can make a brochure to help advertising. Lastily, you can go on microsoft excel and make a schedule that can help your employees know who has to work when, or students can know what class they have to be in at what time. In conclusion, computers are very helpful in everyday for alot of different people. Talking to worldwide can help you stay in, so you dont lose connection with your. They also have effect they help business people stay organized. Lastly, they can help teachers create test or powerpoints which helps kids learn. So in all, I would have to agree that computers have a positive effect on society. Also, doesn't typeing your newspaper articles make it more organized and quicker to print them?",4,4,0
1533,"Dear local Newspaper, Have you ever wondered why people spend so much time on the computer. The effect of people a computer is good and had because the good parts you can communicate with people in far away places, like you can talk to someone you went to @LOCATION1 with in @LOCATION1 and / or @CAPS1 @LOCATION1 with. The bad part is that if your on the computer all the time then you are neglecting time with family and friends. When you are spending all of you time on the computer you are becoming a couch potatoe and its very unhealty of also a good reason is a family member moved and you had to communicate by webcam so if you like live in @LOCATION2 and you have all you family here in @STATE1 other by sending letter and by sending pictures but they cant see how you act and by phone you can only hear voices you can see anything. A lot people disagree because alot people think computers are a big waste so thats all i have to say on the subject.",3,3,0
826,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 a student of the local middle school technology is utilized to the fullest. Computers have helped us write essays more efficiently & complete research assignments. However, personally I feel that this constant usage of computers has a negative impact on people. Firstly, computers hinder interpersonal connections. @CAPS4, @ORGANIZATION1 help keep in touch with old college buddies', but no computer can replace face-to-face communication. From hard, cold text, one cannot decipher subtle connotations or wit. Bot, people are beginning to replace seeing one another with @CAPS3 networking. With the technological revolution came games like @ORGANIZATION2. These games are addicting, @CAPS4, our society mocks ""nerds"" for spending too much time playing these trivial games, but it really is a serious issue. For example, in a recent study done by @ORGANIZATION3 students, ""@NUM1 out of @NUM2 teenagers who play computer games do not get the recommended amount of daily exercise."" This is because these games are so absorbing. The amount of time put into gaming. Ultimately consumes all free time. This is dangerous, because a gaming addiction can lead to delusion, @CAPS3 inadequency, obesity. @CAPS2 a people, we are quickly learning that what was once so genius, is actually dangerous. If one was to stare at a backlit screen for hours on and, their eyesight would definitely start to deteriorate. Loss of eyesight is just one of the negative impacts computers have in our health. @CAPS2 aforementioned, obesity is issue. Now, couple this with bad eyesight, @CAPS5 @CAPS6 deficiency & a negative outlook & you've got yourself a issue. All of the deseases brought on by computers can be just by less time on the computer, & exercises. Naturally, @CAPS2 a specie we were not to spend so much time in a fixed position. This static state is a new phenomena that is aquiring major health problems. The over usage of computers practionally, robs us of our time, destroys our health, & hinders our @CAPS3 interactions. This makes computers a negative influence on people & their health.",5,5,1
830,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers have a positive impact on people. Although people aren't outside being active, computers still benefit in a good way. Computers teach hand-eye coordination they're convient and you can interact online with diffrent types of people. Surely, computers teach hand-eye coordination. There are many website on the internet that teach kids to type. Typing helps kids learn the alphabet, learn what the letters look like and shows them where the keys are. Also, there are other sites where the computer interacts with you. Last, there are many kids even adults who have disiexing and get their letters jumbled, but there are softwares where when you type it will say what letter you have typed. Therefore computer teach hand-eye coordination. Have you ever been one of those students who write their papers, but get bad grades because their handwriting was messy? Using a computer is more convient and will make your due assignment as neat as ever. First, computer are convient because you have the answer to any question just at the click of button. Next, theres no need to spend money and go buy a book to look up research just research online for free. Finally, it is convinient for teachers and your employees, because if you need to send in a paper do it via-email. Getting a paper by email is much easier than getting it in pen with samples. Computer are convient in many ways. Computers allow people @NUM1 video chat and talk online. First, there are many families who have at least one member who lives in a different place. Computer allow families to see each other online. Without ever leaving their state. Next, there are other families who have a mom, dad, husband or wife in the army and haven't seen each other in person in years, but see each other on line. Lastly, there are many students and teachers who teach and learn online. This is easy for most people who have busy lives. Therefore you can interact online. As you can see computers have a positive effect. They teach hand eye coordination. They supply online chat, and are very convient. So next time you go to the library to research a book, stay at home do the same online.",5,5,1
582,"With the click of a mouse, you can access the internet. Computers and internet are a recent innovation. You could probably find one in a common household. They've improved and gotten popular within the last twenty years. I believe they greatly benefit society. Computers provide an easy way to learn and communicate. Think about how life would be in the @DATE1 without computers. Different, right? I don't think I could have written such a great research paper without the use of a computer. The internet has many helpful sources; such as databases, encyclopedias, and articles. You can find information on almost any topic. The computer makes this easier for us to do. You can just search key words, and you have what you're looking for. Its faster than skimming through twenty books. Once you find what you're looking for, you can paste it into a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 document and print it. It's as easy as that. Another benefit of computers is communication. I have found this important over the last few years. A family that I have been close to my whole life had moved to @LOCATION1 due to jobs. Thanks to internet, I have been able to keep in touch with them. Im sure thousands of other people have been in the same situation. Whether it's on email, @ORGANIZATION1 instant messanger, or facebook, people can communicate with others all around the world. It's more convienent than having to time your phone calls so it's a good time for both of you. If we didn't have this connection with forgein countries, everyoneÂ’s lives would be different. Computers haven't just changed personal lives. They change the medical field too. This has greatly benefitted our society. Scientists and doctors find out new discoveries and what advances have been taking place. Doctors use computers to plan and perform surgery procedures. Computers have helped advance and improve the medical research and diagnosis. This saves the lives of many people. @PERCENT1 of tests that have taken place to research a dicsease use a computer of some sort to break it down. The technology of computers has benefitted todayÂ’s society and has helped people achieve great things. It keeps people all over the world connected and helps them learn. I hope that you see how computers have molded and helped the world today.",6,5,1
978,"Dear Readers, @CAPS1 you imagine not talking to distant friends, only knowing about your town, or even failing @CAPS5 you didnÂ’t ha a @CAPS3? I know I couldnÂ’t. Some of the great benefits of having a @CAPS3 are talking online with friends, learning about new places and things everywhere, and being able study for and tests from the internet. First, being able to talk to distant friends and relatives is now passive with the @CAPS3. Facts show show that @PERCENT1 of families in the @LOCATION1 have distant friends with @CAPS2, now all of these people can tlk to each other! Ill never forget the time that my close freinds moved, but i was still able to talk to him @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3. Second, the @CAPS3 allows you to learn about new places and things all around the world. I never would have I know about some of the places I've been to if it was for comoputer, @ORGANIZATION1 stated that the @CAPS3 expert @PERSON1 says ""@CAPS3 are the reason we have in much without @CAPS3 wouldn't know about the places."" @CAPS4, it is now possible study without @CAPS5 of the @CAPS3, @CAPS6 can be done on the internet online. I'll never forget the that I forget my book, but I @CAPS1 still study @CAPS5 of the online book. In conclusion the @CAPS3 has benifits to you, like interacting with friends online, learning about new places, and being able to study. Computers are just end all-around benifits.",4,4,0
487,"Dear @CAPS1, I think some people are overreacting, its not really going to kill you. I'm not suggesting that people should stay on the computer all day. My last reason would be that nowadays everyone nos computers. Keep reading to find out about my three topics: @CAPS2 off way too many people are overreacting, I think so because people say ""you are going to miss out or you are missing out on life. Also you are still interacting with your family and friends, just not verbally (only typing). I don't know why people are so against computers, its like global warming, so many warnings and noone listens, so why will they listen to people saying that staying on a computer too long can make you fat. That was just my opinion/thoughts on that topic. Next off I am going to tell you about how a computer can't really kill you. It can't kill you because it is only a computer for one and another reason is that you can get obeast and bored because I can't stay on the computer for more than an hour because it just gives me a headache. Well that was another opinion of mine so read on to see what else I got. Now I am going to tell you how everyone has computers. The thing is computers are not the only things that cause obeisity. Every one has a computer now because I guess everyone goes on facebook, even my mom has a facebook! But theres also other websites like sexual, games and friend sites. The most used website I think is facebook. I think so because sooo many peole have it.

1770,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, experts have been concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, which is harmful to their health. They are wrong. Computers help people communicate, learn, and even provide entertainment. For these reasons, computers are good. Computers help people communicate with their family and friends, Some people @MONTH1 think that phones are better than computers for communication purposes, but computers are more long distance, and you will never get a busy signal. Some phone services are very expensive, and cost even more money for long distance calling. With a computer, though, you can send emails all around the globe... at no extra cost. Also, with a computer, you never get put on hold or hear a busy signal. You simply send your message, then do whatever you want while you wait for a reply. Computers help educate people, too. Many people take classes, especially college level classes, online. In fact, about half of the people taking college classes right now... aren't even in a school! This can help many people who are working most of the day, because they can get their degree in their. Also, computers can help people with the little things such as, ""where's the nearest @ORGANIZATION1"" or ""how much does something cost."" Computers can ever help people plan a vacation, or learn about a country on the other side of the earth. Computers can also provide entertainment for people. People who need something to cheer them up can watch a funny video with the click of a button. Someone who is feeling bored could play one of countless games that have been created, and range from pointless to addicting, from tiny to massive. For all those @CAPS4 lovers out there, the computer is an alternative. An alternative where songs don't cost money, and neither do music videos. Of course, computers don't fit in your pocket, but there's always a laptop. Based on what you just read, it should be easy to see that computers improve people's lives because they provide education, communication and entertainment.",5,5,1

1548,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 don't have an affect on people because you can play games, webchat, and watch hilarious videos on the computers. Also, you can use the computers for a research project or you can use the @CAPS2 for some facts on @CAPS3 people like @PERSON2, @PERSON1, and @LOCATION1. Also, who would want to get of their @CAPS2 and exercise, exercising is so boring and lame. Second, who would like to especially enjoy the nature, walking through the woulds is so boring, you'll be walking through mud, ticks will be all over body, mosquitoes will try and bite you when you sweat. When kids get older, they mostly don't want to interact or spend time with their family, they want to spend time with their friends everyday. Also, they mostly want to use technology to. Kids will spend time texting on their cellphones when they're not in the mood for calling. Thirdly, computers do give you hand-eye coordination it teaches you how to type without looking down at the keyboard. Computers also teach you how to set you fingers on the home row for the keyboard. Finally, @CAPS2 really do benefit society because you can use this technology in middle school, high school, and through college. When you get older you'll be learning more about these kinds of technology. Also, kids could teach their parents how to use computers if their parents don't know how to.

131,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are beginning to be a problem in many households. I feel that too many people are becoming addicted to computers. People like this are more likely to gain weight, have little social time, and spend too much time inside. In @CAPS6 article I have recently read in the @ORGANIZATION1, it was about @CAPS6 experiment on computer use. Dr. @PERSON1, a @CAPS3 professor stated that his findings showed that people who are addicted to computers only leave their homes to run errands. When this happens, it interferes with their lives as well as their bodies, because our bodies need sunlight. Furthermore, his study also showed that people who go outside more and not on the computer as much tend to be happier. @PERCENT1 of the study's patients started to be more joyful once they stopped going on the computer as often. I like when the people around me are happy, not grouchy, don't you? I have been noticing some kids in my school that are gaining weight. These are kids who have recently started going on the computer for a couple hours at a time everyday. This is very bad for your health and body. If someone sits at their computer all day eating the food is not being worked off, so it all turn to fat. Moreover, statistics show that @PERCENT2 of all obese people in a weight loss class had gained their extra weight from sitting at the computer all day. If people treat their bodies this way, they could end up with some type of condition. Last week, @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @NUM1 intervied @NUM2 year old @PERSON2. @PERSON2's best friend has been ignoring @PERSON2 because he got a @ORGANIZATION1 computer. Now, @PERSON2's friend doesn't want to hang out with @PERSON2, or any of his other friends. In addition, when people become addicted to computers, they become less social with friends and other people like parents, teachers, and more. When people push aside their social time for computer games, chat rooms, or movie websites, they lose a large portion of their life. This can be stopped if parents put their foot down, set limits, and make kids spend more time outside. As you can clearly see, computers @MONTH1 have some benefits, but they have many disadvantages. Addicted compuer users become less social, they don't go outside and start to ""pack on the pounds."" @CAPS6 effect of this is a world full of people who sit on the computer all day eating food and gaining weight.",5,5,1
1365,"Dear Newspaper, I think that when kids or even adults get computers, then they would not use it for good causes. When people get computers they spend more time inside and on them. They need to get outside get some exercise. Even little things like, if your going to your friends house, then take a jog there instead of your bike. When people spend more time on their computers than talking to your freinds, then they will be low on socializing and, after awile won't know how to communicate with people. All they would have to do is set a time limit on their computer and only use it for work otherwise. Computers could also be used for good things. If you have a project for school and need to type it up on the computer or find pictures on the internet then the computer would be a good resource. If you have a job for working with computers or fixing computers, then you would spend a lot of time on your computer. It also lets you interact with people on the othe side of the world. You can also learn about interesting facts or places. Computers could also be used for bad reasons. When people use it they could just use it to play this cool new video game they got. This can lead them into getting obese. They can also use it for sexual harrasment for stalking people. People can also use it for horrible things like selling or buying drugs or illegal things. So as you can see computers aren't safe in a lot of ways. I hope you can read and understand all the important facts explaining my reasons and consider them. Thank you and have a good day.",4,4,0
1350,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, With computers being so popular right now it's easy to think that they are helpful and have a positive effect on the people that use them. However, I do do belive that computers have more harmful effects than good ones on the people they are used by. I belive this for @NUM1 reasons. One, they take away from spending time with real people, they make people get less excersis, and also they are very distracting and waste time. One reason why I don't think computers have a positive effect on people is that the time spent on the computer could be put to better use by doing things with family and friends. Now and day people are using social networking sites like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 to talk with people far away. People can spend hours communication with someone they will never meet and completly ignore the people who care for and love them. Also communication with people online can be dangerous because the person who you are messaging might not be who they say they are. Overall, setting out and actually spending time with real people creates memories that you will cherish for the rest of your life. This feeling can never occur through the internet. Another reason why I think that computers have a bad effect on their users is that constant computer use has resulted in a lack of excersise for many people. People who use computers for many hours are just sitting still. They aren't being active. The only movement that occurs while on a computer is the tiny flick of a finger as it clicks the mouse button. This is clearly not enough excersise that is required to maintain a healthy and happy lifestyle. Studies have shown that since the invention of computers young people especially have been gretting less and less physical activity. I'm sure that this will continue to get worse if people continue spending a majority of time on their computers. A third reason why I think computers are having a negative effect on people is because they are distracting and they waste time. An example of this is that once when I was online doing research for a school project, I saw an advertisment for a website that looked interesting. When I clicked on it I was brought to a site full of funny stories and pictures. I spent the next half an hour reading entries on that website and completely forgot about my project. When I relized what I had done I rushed to finish my research and ended up getting a poorer grade then. I'm sure I would have gotten if I had not been distracted other things to do on the computer. This is why I think computers do not have a good effect on the people who use them. They take away from spending time with family and friends, they result in less excercise. And they waste time and are distractions. ",5,5,1

In the past, everyone has computers and gets knowledge from them. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 surveyed at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 agree computers are helpful to us. In my opinion, computers have a positive effect on people. The first reason is computers teach hand eye coordination. Without this coordination, people would not survive. The users be over very quickly. The computer makes us use these muscles so we can live happily. @PERCENT1 of the @CAPS3 recently took a survey at the @CAPS3 @CAPS4, agree computers are the main source of hand eye coordination. Dr. @DR1 expert in relationship to humans said, ""People without computers cant do what others can. They are unable to have fast reaction time."" To sum it up computers help with hand eye coordination. The second reason is computers allow us to learn about far away places. when you can't look up and learn about places, you are not about them. You're lucky if you know when in the world they are. Computers allow you to look up those places. You can look into going there for vacation or doing a report. @PERCENT2 of the adults who surveyed at the public library said the computers help. They are full of so much more information than books. To sum it up, computers allow you to learn about far away places. The third reason is computers allow you to talk online to people. This extends your friend ships with people. You can talk on the computer, not just at school. It also allows you meet new and different people. You can talk to people in @LOCATION1 that you couldn't talk to without computers. Computers allow you to open up the to all people. @PERCENT1 of parents who took a poll in @ORGANIZATION1 say they want their children to learn about different cultures. They need the computer for that task. To sum it up, computers allow you to talk online to people. In conclusion, computers have a positive effect on people. The reasons are to teach hand eye coordination, learn about faraway places, and talk to people online. I strongly urge you to look at any point of view closely. This decision is now up to you.

The computer has helped mankind with various discoveries about our world. As far as many can see, this piece of technology has positive effects on people everywhere, everyday.

996,"Dear @CAPS1 I heard a lot of people are spending to much time in the computers and less time exercising, enjoying the nature, and interacting with family and friends. In my opinion I think you should know the compouter because it helps for school homework or projects, talking to family far away and finding new friends. My first reason why we should keep computers is because it @MONTH1 help on school homework or projects. This is my top reason because its really helpful and its useful when you need it also if your computer its not working you can go to your friends house and use computers, when your done you can save on hardrive and print it in your school's computers. My segond reason why you should keeps computer is talking to family. Without the computer you can't communicate with family. In my opinion computers are very helpful to cummnicate with family. If your phone is not working you can also use the computer to communicate with your family. My third reason is communicating and find new friends without the who are you going to meet and communicate with you can communicate with your family throught the computer, or even if your running late you can send them a message through the computer. In my opinion I think the computer its a really good way to communicate with your family. I know that people say they spend to much time in the computers and its addicting, but its good for school work like projects and assignments, also people said its just to what on the but in my opinion we should keep computers because its no to see whats on the other person. Its to do school work and talk to family. I know people spend to much time in computers but to other people its not. In my opinion, we should not get rid off computers because it good for doing school work and talking with family. I think what you should do its not get rid off computers.",3,4,0
962,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern, I think computers are a good thing. It is good because you get to learn about forein places. Keep in touch with family and friends and it is good entertainment. First, computers are great to learn about forein places. On the computers you could research a place and look at pictures before you go. If I wanted to go to a far away place like @LOCATION3. I would go on the computer and find the best part to go to and I would look at different hotels to stay at the reviews it has gotten. Aslo, if someone were to do a paper on a different country or even state that they've never been to they would go on the computer. Sure, you can get the same info from books but you can filter out what you don't need on the computer. In my history calss, I had to do a report on the state of @LOCATION2. I have never been there so I want on the computer. Books could have given me the same info but computers are always up to date and accurate. Seecond, computers help you keep in touch with family and friends. There are numerous websites that allow you to share photos and talk to friends or family. I recently signed up for facebook and I am able to talk to friends instead of using mytexts and running over the phone bill every mont. My dad has a facebook too, he talks to people he hesn't seen since he moved heve from the @LOCATION1 white mountains. Some other sites are aim, aol, and myspace. Lastly computers are good entertainment. Computers allow you to see that concert you didn't go to or that movie that's never on tv. When I went to a skate board demo at skate lair I had tons of fun. The other day though, I started thinking about it.

Computer also allow you to check the news and weather. This is good because if you are on the road and you want to see what's going on you can take out a laptop and checked the weather or news. That is why I think computers are necessary. Yes people do stay on four hours at a time but most people only go on for a small amount.",4,5,0
659,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are a great way to learn about the world and its people. Computers can teach people about things that are forien to them. Computers keep people intouch, all over the world. Computers also come in handy when something needs to be looked up right away. Computers are very helpful when it comes to learning. They can teach you things that most books cant, such as hand eye coordination also about the current populations of countrys and cities. Also, computers gives you the opportunity to see pictures of places and people that you couldn't find in books or photo albums or newspapers. They also help in schools when projects are asigned. Kids can use computers to find information they need quickly. Kids can also use computer to wright essays or print pictures for projects. Computers are definately a staple for learning & education. Computers are also great for comunication. People can chat with one another on networking sites such as @CAPS1, facebook, myspace, and twitter. On these sites people can send messages to their friends a leaking them of something or chat with their friends to see whats to keep in touch with family and friends, on the computer. Family members can e-mail each other to inform them of an event or news. I have actually had an experience with e-mail that was very helpful my family members and I had been speaking of traveling to block island and two days before we were going to leave we recived on email from the owner of the house we were going to stay at stating that all phone lines were down and part of the house was ruined due to a storm. If it werent for computers we would have been in a sick situation. Computers also come in handy in times of need or confusion. People can check their local weather forecasts to see of the weather will effect their plans. Also if someone doesn't know where a house or store is located they cab quickly look it up on the computer. Finaly if something is unavailable on a store people can shop for it online and can buy what they need, and have it shaped to their door step. Computers have helped this country grow and prosper. Why bother to go aginst them when they benafit society so much? Computers are helping the world become a better educated, connected, and informed world.",5,5,1
1728,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I believe that there is more and more controvosy about computer and whether they benefit society or not. In my opinion, computers are a wonderful resource that will soon become a household item. I am writing to persuade you that computers have a positive effect on people. I believe computers are a good thing because they allow people access to more knowledge, they allow people to stay in contact with people they dont see very often, and they allow people to keep up and know whats going on in modern life. One reason computers are useful is that they allow people to stay in contact with people they don't see very often. Today, parents don't mind sending their children off to college as much because they can actually see them using video chat websites like @ORGANIZATION1. This feature on computers has a big impact on the life of people today. People in @LOCATION1 can talk with people in @LOCATION2. This type of often allows for people to share new and inventive things they've discovered. Another reason computers can be useful is because they help people keep in touch with modern life. Many companies are now erasing newspaper ads and putting them all on computer websites. Some companies are only selling items on their websites and shipping them to the buyers. With computers students can also get their homework done and send it to their teacher by email if they cannot make it to school that day. There is even at home colleges now where you take your class online. I believe that in a few years from now more and more people will do business with computers and more stores will sell online only. Finally the last reason I believe computers are a good idea is that they allow people access to more knowledge with the internet. There are websites soldy devoted to history and information on many things. Also there are blogging websites where people can debate on information or get questions answired by real people who @MONTH1 know a lot about the topic. Another thing on computers that helps you get informed is websites like wikipedia where people can search a topic, read history about it, and follow links to other websites if they want to pick apart the topic even more. Overall, I believe that computers area a great resource to human kind and will be used for more and more things in a few years. I believe computers are useful because they allow people access to more knowledge, the ability to keep in touch with others, and to keep in touch with modern life. I believe that in a couple years there will be liss stores on the streets and most will be online because it is much cheaper for the companies. So, most people in a couple years will be computers and use them effectively.",4,5,0
1143,"To the @CAPS1, I have recently heard that some people think that computers don't benefit society. However, I disagree with that. First, it allows children and adults to learn about distant places and other things. Also, it allows family and friends to connect with other family and friends. And lastly, it is a form of entertainment on a day that you can't go outside. Some people might not agree with me. However, I believe the computer wasn't a waste of thought. I think the computer is a benefits to society and the whole world. First, the computer allows children and adults to learn about distant places and, other things. People, professors, historians, and either highly educated people past discoveries and information about things everyday. That means everyday someone can learn something everyday of their life. When I do research on a important person in history, I learned things I never learned in school. The computer is the best way to allow people to put info they've learned for other people to see and gain knowledge of each other these are endless possibilities for everyone who owns a computer to learn. You wouldn't believe the things you can learn on a computer. Also, the computer allows family and friends stay in touch with other family and friends in far away places. If there was computers and someof your family moved to a diffrent. There wouldn't be an efficient way to stay in touch with them. The computer allows you to send e-mail to a families computer or celluar phones. The computer is the best way to stay close to your family even though they are far away. My brother is in @LOCATION1 and every day I get on the computer when I get home and video chat with him. If there was no computer, I wouldn't be able to chat with my brother. Lastly, the computer allows a form of entertainment on a rainy day. Certain software gives people the chance to create games and post online to the public. When I can't go outside because of the weather I get on my computer and play video games. The games keep me company. I can never play with other people with online multiplayer. Some of the games are educational also. The games teach you different things about history. ",4,4,0
1212,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 home computers is a good thing for many reasons. One reason is because people can use computers to learn about other countries and people. People can also use computers to type and save paper. Also, people can use computers to talk to people living close or far away from you. Finally, computers can save paper by replacing books. One @MONEY1 the most important reasons why people need computers is because computers can help you learn about and research other things going on in the world. If a student needs to research a country and write a paper about it for school, it is much easier and faster to use a computer than to look through a textbook.Computers are also better and faster than a textbook if you want to know more about a person or a culture. Using computers to type are also faster than writing a paper. Using a computer can save time and money when it comes to typing a paper. When you are typing a paper, you don't have to worry about @CAPS1 handwriting or breaking your pencil. You also don't have to worry abut spelling something wrong because computers can check you spelling and grammar. What you are writting a paper you have in about all @MONEY1 these problems and more. You also have to spend money on pencils and other writting suppplies. Computers also saved people @MONEY1 becase they didn't need to buy paper to make textbooks. Computers also evolved how people can communicate with each other. Before computers were invented, you couldn't talk to people in other countries unless you paid to use a phone or sent them mail. Now, you can send instant mail which saves days @MONEY1 time and paper. You can also use webcams to talk to family members and people you don't know. That can save you a lot @MONEY1 money because you don't have to pay money for postage stamps, phone calls, or plane rides to visit them. Those are some @MONEY1 the best reasons why @CAPS1 a home computer is better than not @CAPS1 one. A home computer can save you time when you want to research a country, person, or culture. They can save you money because you don't have to buy postage stamps, pay for phone calls, or pay for plane rides to visit someone from a different state or country. Computers also help save paper because you no longer need to make large textbooks or use a different price @MONEY1 paper when you make a writting mistake.",5,4,1

673,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 my opinion on this is that people do use computer's a lot! Some people donÂ’t care about exercising, or enjoying nature, maybe people dont even have friends so they spent a lot of there time on the computer because they have no life or maybe they just go on websites that are addictive. For example @CAPS2.com, people/kids have one of those? They chat with friends or maybe even boyfriends. Enyways thats my opinion. Another opinion is that I think people should not spend most of there time on the computer. I think that because people should be having fun, socializing with people, and living there life! So this is what I I think, my opinion about ""Computers"".",3,3,0
1309,"Dear newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you have a computer? @CAPS1 your kids spend all of their time on it talking in people or going on facebook or myspace? Well thatÂ’s fun and all for a few hours but some people spend a lot of time on there. They don't go out and get exercise or interact with their family and friends. Also they @MONTH1 end up getting in trouble in school or at home. If you spend all of your time on the computer doing whatever your doing you won't have time to go out and exercise. Not only will it be in appeling but it could be dangerous for your health after a while. All your time gets sucked into the computer and when your on it you feel like your not on for a long time and it ends up being like a few hours. It even happens to adults, my mom was on the computer for about an hour and she felt like it was only a few mins. When your on your computer for several hours you tend to got sucked in and not interact with anyone. I know this from experience. A few months ago I spent about a whole month just coming home from school and being on the computer for several hours. This effected my life a lot, I stopped going out on weekends with my friends, I always wanted to stay home when my family wont out. Then my mom confronted me about it and I realized all of my time on the computer wasn't good. I was missing out on a lot of things. Kids @MONTH1 also get at home or at school if they are on the computer for a long time they @MONTH1 not @CAPS1 their homework and end up failing a class and then stay back. Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of the kids that stay on the computer for a long time end up either failing a class or staying rack. They @MONTH1 also get in trouble at home because they dont @CAPS1 their chores because their busy on the computer and neither the child or the children like getting in fights with one another. Now I know in a way it's good to have computers and be able to use them so we can look up information and its nice to sometimes talk to people on the computer for a little while but being on the computer for a little while but being on the computer for to long of an amount ran really mess you and your social life up. So all im trying to prove is that computers are an amazing invention but we should just use them a little less and get out and excersise, and have fun with our family and friend and @CAPS1 good in school and at home so we @CAPS1 get to spend some time on the computer. I hope you see it my way now.",4,4,0
1492,"Dear local news paper, I think computers can have a bad effect on people from a really early age. Starting at thirteen and up through adulthood. People spend hours at a time on the computer when they canbe exercising or doing some type of activity out doors. Computers can make some people feel like life is being taken away form them. Spending so much time on a computer can really damage a person posture. It is said that when some get on a computer a state of comfortbility comes over them and they lean over with their backs bent and they there for periods of time. Imagin a person being cramped in a tight space for eight hours and when that person gets out they all their joints and muscles being stretched from that point of tensions. This is what we do to our bodys when we get on computers.",4,4,0
839,"Computers are one of the best advances in technology ever made. Not only are computers fun but they're also very beneficial to society. First off, comptuers are great way to communicate with other people whether it's instant-messageing, email, video-messaging, or services like @ORGANIZATION1. @DATE1, Computers offer many learning opportunities. There are thousands or websites with information about your search whether it be about simple things like how to bake cookies or even more complex searches like how many stars are in the sky. Last but not least, computers just simply make life easier by helping you with everday needs. To begin, computers are a great source of communication. I remember a time when my father traveled to @LOCATION1 on business. Because it costs so much money to pay for international cellphone service, my dad could not call using his cell phone. Instead, my father called using @ORGANIZATION1. It was great because it was right on the computer. Besides making live communication easier, computers also help to communicate news, weather few weeks ago, the the home was out. It was to shout the @DATE1, so my family had no way to. Since are than our cable provider, we were able to look up. School was indeed our computer, we world. Plus, computers offer more learning opportunities. Aside from being a great source of communication, computers are fantastic for searching and research. For almost all of my school assignments that required research, I've used a computer. Sometimes, you can even find articles from library books online. Some people say that the library is always the best place to find information but I disagree. More than half the time, the internet has beyond enough information for what I need. Studies show that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people say that computers answered their question better than any library book, did. Also, computers make life a whole lot easier. Computers make life so much easier. From typing to research to communicating and even to making travel arangements, computers help to make everday chores a lot easier. When my cousing was in highschool, she was assigned a @NUM3 word essay for homework. First off, it's pain having to count everyword and also, most importantly it's no fun having to write that much so my cousin decide to just type it. It saves time and is way neater. She finish her typed essay in @NUM4 hour while love friend finished in an @NUM4 @NUM4/2 hours because she hand wrote it. Its you on computers are esier. To conclude, computers are beneficial because they're a great source of communication, they offer many learning opportunities, and they make life so much easier. Thank you for reading, and I hope I've persuaded you to agree with my position that computers are one of the best advances in technology ever accomplished and why they are so beneficial to society.",5,5,1

Usually your family either lives far away or in another state and you dont get to see them very often. Thats why I think video chating on the computer is a good thing. Also is a family come up you could @CAPS1-mail @CAPS2 your family members instead of calling them because they would talk to you forever.

Also if your family was having a discusion at dinner and you had no idea what they were talking about you would look it up online, lastly if you just wanted to find lyrics to a song because you and a friend disagreed on something.

Another great thing about talking online is that I can talk to all my friends, not just the one I am playing with.

So next time you feel like spending another @NUM4 hours on the computer, take a walk and I'm sure you will be amazed at what you find outdoors. In conclusion, computers do not benefit society.

Most students have @CAPS2-average because studies show it's because of computers. Also if your son has a lapttop they're not doing work if that is what you think. I have computers, but we have, books for a reason, no spank, pop ups, or no distractions while working. Like one time I was working on a project, a pop-up came up and read trafic rush free to your computer. So dume me downloads it and @CAPS6 parents caught me playing. Has this changed your mind. Since you probably haven't changed your mind here is another thing way computer bad, your car. All guys love cars. Computers are holding more thand @PERCENT3 of people working or driving their cars. Te only person it hasn't affected is @CAPS6 dad, he works on his cars day in and day out. @CAPS6 grandmom said something interesting to me the after day,""@CAPS3 your dad comes up to visit me more can @CAPS6 other sons, @CAPS6 ohter sons are carzy for computers.""People go bannas for computers today. Latly I have seen less and less people outside anymore. There is only reason for that, all people are shaved in their basement in the dark, so when their light it gurns their eyes it's so bright. Come on did this change your mind yet now. Well since you are still reading on that means you cannot make up your mind. Well here's this people are starting to not want to ride their bikes anymore. That is facebook, this is what they thinks,""@CAPS4 it talk now why I need to ride to talk in person?"" That @PERCENT1 right for what they are think. Because we task a test of all the kids who have facebook, and that's what around all of them said. I know amazing @CAPS5 a at home mother said,"" @CAPS6 son's gaining weight, all her does is eat and go on facebook. When he not on during they day, I catch him at night too."" That is a sad story for that mohter. I ride @CAPS6 bike a lot, this is a real life story: once I was sitting around doing nothing really did @CAPS6 mom said we are riding bikes for @NUM1 miles. I got up end did it too. That had to change your mind, or nothing will. So, in conclusing I have no more ideas for no computers and why. But just remember your grades, cars, and your weight. So please, change your mind.",4,5,0
1779,"Dear @LOCATION1, *@CAPS1*. Now I hear my favorite @CAPS2 tunes. A few clicks here and type in a word and I am watching a funny episode of ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4 #@NUM1"". I go to my @CAPS5 page and feel the cool keys under my fingertips as I send @CAPS7 to my friend in @LOCATION3. These are only some things I can do on my computer. As you can see I need my computer for many things. I am all for using computers and I think they are a useful resorce. But @CAPS6't stop now, I have many more reasons for using computors. Thier not all that bad. Primarily, if you want to save money on gas, @CAPS6't Use @CAPS7 @CAPS8!! I can't stress @CAPS7 enough to say that if you need to talk to a friend far away @CAPS6't drive and waste gas, or even waste money on long-distance calls. Go to @CAPS5, facebook, twitter, or something that will save you gas and money. Some people want to talk to thier friends in @LOCATION2 but they @CAPS6't have any of these computer sites. Pursuade them too!! Another issue some face is, ""You need to get out and excersize."" I have only one answer. Most people @CAPS6't know the right ways to excersize. Then, they end @CAPS8 hurting themselves. If they just went online and found out that they could do a painless, priceless, fun work out that is very effective then they would not get in so much physical and finantial trouble. Also, others complain that people need to @CAPS10 more out in nature. Well, I say, what if you encounter a wild animal that you know nothing about, or say you were lost for days and didn't know what you could or could not eat? LIke I @CAPS9 say, ""@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11"" remember @ORGANIZATION1. FInally, if your doing a report or something formal, you want @CAPS7 to look nice, right? Well, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people in the @LOCATION4 have messy handwriting and 9/@NUM3 teachers mistake words that are messily hand-writen. This shows that if you use a computor @CAPS7 will not only show the word you wrote but also correct @CAPS7 with spell check. In conclusion, there are many benefits to using a computor. Lets recap, computors can save money, time, and gas. Computars can provide useful information in the real world. They can also correct spelling mistakes as well as prevent mistakes in legibility. Act now!!! Show others that there are benifits to using computers, show them all the wonders of this amazing machine, That is not only a time waster but a life saver.",5,5,1
769,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 newspaper, I firmly believe that computers do have a positive benefits on society. These advancements in technology can only enrich peoples lives. One way computer help is that students can do their school work online and see their teachers pages. Another great thing about computers is that whenever people need information or details on any place or things have can count on the internet to help them out. Most importantly they are a vital source of communication. People depend on computers for their scheduling and keeping in touch with everyone that they know. Without computers students would have it a lot worse. When a student forgets the homework, they can just go on their teachers online page and check what he assignment was for that night. Another thing that students benefit from are online textbooks. If a student can't manage to carry home @NUM1 pounds of books they can just use their textbook online. Nowadays, the internet is filled with lots of great information and educational site. Teacher also can allow students to research for projects online and participate in online educational activities. Not only do computer help out educationally' they are probably the must well known information centers. If people want to see about a restaurant, store or product, they can do that online. Also, many people want to go to destinations but do not know how to get there. The internet provides them with directions for them on how to reach their destination in a quick and efficient manner. An extremely important and helpful aspect of the internet is the ability of purchasing and ordering items online. Before someone decides to but something, they can find out all sorts of information about the product and shop around for the lowest price. People can even order groceries to new house if they are busy! I strongly think that the internet is the number one way of communication between people. For example, the team manager of my soccer team always emails me times and locations of the next game or practice. I would be lost and confused without these emails what I depend on. Buisnesses also heavily rely on the internet to keep in touch with their clients that keep them in buisness. The use of web confrences saves a lot of travel and it allows the company to be in buisness with all over the world. Above all, people depend heavily on social networking sites to keep intouch with friends, keep up to date on the news, and have fun talking to people. Without the internet, probably half of the world communications would be down and that would not be good. Computers, without do have positive effect on society. When it can be an educational resource it is very helpful. Also, it is the best information database known to and is probably the most used. Most importantly, wihout computer the world would be a mess without their main source of communications People know not to spend too much time inside and he always know when to go outside have some fun and get some fresh air. Therefore, computers have no negative effect on people and they remain an essential asset in everyday life.",5,5,1

Those who suport advasas in tecnollogy belive that computers have a positive afect on peoples life. Well I @CAPS2 belive that it does not have a positive ofect on people. My reasons are that people who youse computers more dont get their exercise and get fater, and if you put Your name and adress on the computer their is a slite @CAPS3 that you will be kidnaped or murderd, my final reson is that you dont spend as much time with the familiy that you should.

Although computers are all around us they do not have a possitive effect on people because, harmful people could findout where you live and they are too addicting. Where ever you look you can find a computer. At home, in school, in your car, at work, and hotels. Being exposed to these computers are helpful. Everything we see now a days is run by or has a computer. In the future we are going to see more and more computers. Buisnesses practically run off of computers, soon they will run them by thereself. Also with so many computers it creates jobs. You can make computers, program them, fix them, and even supervise them doing work. Even though everyone says they are safe on the computer, they are not. While on a chatting website you could meet someone and they might be a child melestor or a. They can find out where you live and when no one is home or when you are home alone. With your address they can even look at your house on a website or possibly get your houses blueprints. Then they can come and leave you mentally scared for life. There are tons of things you can do on a computer. For example you can play games. There are games with virtual worlds or games that are fun and have no meaning. Either way games on the computer are too addicting. You say you are going to play for @NUM1 minutes but they are so addicting you play for @NUM2 hours. The games just suck you in and your stuck.

Computers let us not just talk to each other but it also lets us challenge each other on games without hurting each other it could even stop all ways all at once because we could challenge other countries in war games without killing real living people. We can check our taxes and stocks. It also makes it easier to find health insurance, car insurance, and house insurance. We can look up historical facts on the computer. We can look up how to stop snake venom from getting to your heart and how to make a how and some arrows to hurt with.

1613,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a positive affect on society because it gives a lot of information, it has lots of fun games and music, and it informs you about issues in the world and communities.

If you need to do projects and research, what better way to do them than on a computer. You can search all kinds of people like the presidents of the @LOCATION1, celebrities, and people that made a change in the world. You can also look @CAPS5 and study different kinds of plants and animals, and you can find fasmating experiments to do. The second reason I think that computers have a positive affect on society is because it has lots of fun games and music. You can go on the @CAPS1 channel website and play lots of diffrent games from your favorite t.v shows. They also have learning games on test prep fun where you can play games to help you do well on your @ORGANIZATION2 such as comprehension clinic.

1232,"Advancements in technology are very practical and have a positive effect on those fortunate enough to have a computer. First, computers help reach people to have better hand-eye coordination. @CAPS1, computers make it simple to learn new information about many things such as people and places across the globe. finally, computers allow people in different places to communicate instantly for the reasons above, computers are very helpful to people all around the world. One of the ways computers help people is through improving their hand eye coordination when a person learns to type and look at a screen at the same time. They will be able to do sample everyday asks much better. Is a person does not have good hand-eye coordination. They cannot ever make on the ones of a paper properly! This also, with focus, and people with better focus excel in school, work and their social lives. Hand-eye coordination is very important to learn and computers help to teach it to people. The @CAPS1 reason that I think computers people to learn about new. I myself and through have know many proces. My now lucky I to be able to realize how, and the research is because of computers. Computers are aducating. Finally, computers handy because they telephone. One way communication in computers is my instant. This is when they type and this is similar to a telephone conversation, but free of charge. The final and most popular way is video chat. Video chat is when the people use cameras connected to their computers and can talk to each other while seeing each other's face! All these ways of communicating with people around the world are very beneficial to many people, especially those with family or friends living in another town. Without a doubt, computers benefit people in society in many ways. They teach them hand eye coordination which is very important for simple, everyday tasks they also help people everywhere in the world learn about that they couldnt learn about with books. Last but not least, computers people are world in communicate with each other. In all these ways, computers help people everywhere and.",5,5,1
1561,"Dear Local @CAPS1, @CAPS2 do you feel about computers? Are they good or are they bad? I strongly believe that computers are bad and people spend to much time on them. I'd much rather spend time outside where I can excercise; @CAPS3't you? Computers are a waste of time and they keep family and friends from spending time together. Finally, computers can be very dangerous. People could be lying and you @CAPS3't know it. To start off, computers take away from excercising and spending time outside. I know if I had to choose between looking at a boring computer screen all day and going out for a run; I'd choose the run anyday. Computers don't keep people fit and healthy so they should find something else to do instead. I've observed that the average teen spends @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours a day on the computer. That's @NUM1 to @NUM2 hours they could be excercising or playing outside. For example, walking the dog, or kicking the soccer ball around. You see, there are many things you can do other than going on the computer. Further more, computers cut into quality time with friends and family. I know you can video chat and instent message them, but @CAPS3't you rather spend time with them in person? Too many kids are on the computer so much they don't know what's going on in their mom or dads lives. Theres is a lot of things kids can do with their friends and families instead of using the computer. They could play a board game, watch a movie, and much more. I garentee they will enjoy these activities more then staring at a computer screen for @NUM5 hours. Finally, computers are extremly dangerous. People have been killed because they don't know who they are talking to. Kids go on myspace and put up pictures and posts, but they don't realize that everyone can see what they said. Once they put something out there they cannot take it away. It's also dangerous because it someone is applying to a school that school can see what they put up and can decline the person from college. I hope you agree with me when I say computers are bad. They keep people from excercising, spending time with friends/family, and are very dangerous. In my opinion we should get rid of computers in every house.",4,5,0
1610,"Dear @CAPS1, I remember when I was younger my parents got two laptops for themselves. Internet use was always available, interaction of online chat. It was extremly exciting for them. On the other hand, I got to sit home and watch them have fun. I couldn't go outside, or hang out with friends just because I was stranded insided as they enjoyed the computer. I strongly feel as if computers do not benefit society. People spend too much time using the internet than exercising, nobody gets to enjoy the beauty of nature, and there is less interaction with family and friends. There are many holes being dog while computers one still being used and bought. Our society is just going downhill from here. People don't need to be sitting at home inside breathing reused air while using the computer. Proffessor @PERSON3, a health generalist, stated on @ORGANIZATION2 news that @PERCENT1 of all people around @LOCATION1 would rather be on the computer at home doing nothing than going outside and/or getting some kind of exercise. Could you imagine all of those unhealthy people not worriying about anything except their computer? the only thing computers do for us these days is abandon our free time. @CAPS2 waist @PERCENT2 of there spare time on their computer. If technology decreases there new games people play, and sites people use, it is likey for people to get out of the house and do something healthy for themselves. @PERSON1, owner of @ORGANIZATION1, said ""I have never seen in my entire life, so many people using there computers and internet. Its been quite sometimes when over one billion @CAPS2 are online on a typical weekend. "" @PERSON1 later mentions "" it's kind of depressing of how much time they spend on computers, than outside and enjoying nature."" Not only is excersicing time headed down the drain, but our used to be "" beautiful"" nature is as well. Many young kids these days are watching @CAPS3, they see computer game commercials there parents buy them the game, and all of a sudden they are on it @NUM1. Since adults aren't doing there part by idolizing these kids to persuade them to run around outside and do something healthy. The kids need to step up for a change! Did you know global warming is caused by the minimum density in the air? If we have almost to no children or adults running around outside, our world is not flowing too well. Hence our budget is low, and pollution is extremly off the wall; our nature is going from beatifu to less and lesser. @PERSON2, a government official has survey @NUM2 people from each state asking about how much time they spend weekly of just enjoying nature and roleizing the beaty of it. The survey reads one in every @NUM3 people thoughly breathe in the beauty for at least @NUM4 minuests, a week. I mean come on; that's pathetic. Maybe if we surely excluded computers and technology for a while, global warming won't be nessicary. I remember when I was about @NUM4 years old an I never once got to meet my other family besides my siblings. It was pretty sad because I'm always told I have a huge family that is very known to our town but I have no clue who they are ! this is all because technology was invented. Never once have I ever been outside and relaxed besides when I got on and off the bus for school. My parents stand me in my house as they use the computer. The other day I just found out what ""show"" is because my moms computer brake and now I am get introduced to my other family along with the freedom of going outside. Ever since my mom's computer brake she has lots of free time to spend with me. Technology ruined my childhood as a kid and without it you get to open up the real importance of life. Would you want to become obese, like through global warming, and/or to not interact with family or outside nature?

1376,"Dear @PERSON1, I am writing a letter to discuss the fact that computers have a negitive effect on the average american, here are my reasons people are not spending much time outside, lack of exersize, do not interact with their family as much. Not spending much time can have a big effect on mother nature. Such as they will begin to care less about our wonderful earth and not care to pollute because if they took the time to go outside instead of running the air conditioner they can save the money and go be with their friends. Lack of exersize can be very bad for your health. Sitting down all day on the computer is not exersize its lazyness. When you exersize you feel good about yourself, your adreniline starts going, you can stay fit and you wan't have to worry about being unhealthy if you take yourself away from the computer. When you do not interact with your family and instead of eating dinner together one persons on the computer and the others are waching @CAPS1. You might argue with your family a lot and don't you want to have a healthy relationship. So why don't you encourage your family to sit down at the table and discuss how your day went.

1455,"To whom this @MONTH1 concern: I heard that people are having a debate to tell whether computers benefit us or are bad for us. I think that computers are great. They allow us to talk with people all over the world. They give us the ability to learn about things. Lastly, they save us money. Aren't these all things benefit us? I think so. Please keep reading to hear more about why computers are good. First off, computers give us the ability to talk with people all over the world. A lot of my family lives in different @CAPS1, and thats how I talk to them is through the computer. If you move away from all your friends and family, wouldn't you want to still keep intouch with them? Well you could by chatting with them on the computer. To keep the ball rolling, computers give us the oppirtunity to learn about different things. If I go on ""@CAPS2.com"", I could type in anything I want, and get information about it. Or I get an answer to a question. Are you a parent that wants to know how their child is doing in school? You could go to their school website and check their grades in each class they have. To wrap it all up, computers save us money everyday. If you needed to look up information for a project without a computer, you would have to drive all the way to the library and buy a book. But with a computer, you could get information easy in the convienience of your own home. In conclusion, you could see that computers benefit us in many ways. Thay give us the ability to talk to friends and family all around the world. They give us the oppirtunity to look up information quick and easy. Lastly, they save us money everyday. Thank you for reading my letter, which I'm sure has persuaded you to think that computers are a good thing.",4,4,0
542,"Let's go back around @NUM1 years ago. Those were days when it could take weeks to communicate with out of state family. Days when knowledge was only found in books, and ofen found slowly. Those were days where everything was done with a lack of speed and precision. Computers change all that. With nothing but the tap of a finger, we can communicate with people worldwide, or sea the web for some knew information. @PERCENT1 of people's relatives live out of their state. I can relate, with @NUM2 cousins in @LOCATION2 and @NUM2 in @LOCATION1. Without these instant messages and emails, we would more than likely talk to them once, maybe twice a year! Some people say that computers make people spend less time interacting with family and friends. For me personally, and I know many others, interaction would be impossible without these modern manuals. With all the @LOCATION1 technology out there. Nothing has me as amazed as the webcam. You, with this tool, can talk face to face with someone on the other side of the world! The world is a better place when we can have a true connection to other cultures, and what better way than to talk to them. What people @NUM4 years ago would never think possible, we can use at a moments notice, and yet still, many people don't appreciate it. My @CAPS1 and my @CAPS2 have both used internet to reunite with old college buddies, or see how far away friends are. These are grown ups, using the tools available to improve their lives. Internet goes beyond teenagers on @CAPS3 and @CAPS4. What you can find online still amazes me. The information you could get out of @NUM2 non-function books, you could find in turn minutes on the internet. Any question, including personal, anything, can be answered. Years ago people would have killed for this power, for the common man to be able to access all he ever needed to. I see the point people make about needing excersize and they're right. But in five minutes on the web you could have an exersize routine planned out, with modern techniques and styles. The computer has anything for anyone. Looking for some place to enjoy nature & @ORGANIZATION1 it. In seconds there will be thousands thousands of results. Missing a dictionary? There are literaly hundreds of sites to find a definition online. People take these machines for granted and assume we could live without them, but I doubt they ever realize how much we really need them. The technology is there. Why not use it? I could never turn down an opportunity to talk to a distant cousin, or another kid from a different country. I couldn't pass up a chance to check up on some old buddies that moved away. Thanks to computers, I have that opportunity. I have that chance. I've been shown an open door to find out everything I could want. Man can't know everything. But these days, he can find out anything. I'm not sure if the omputer has changed the direction of advancing technology, but I can tell you, it has definitly offered the course.",5,5,1
775,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 that use computers is a good thing. I state this because the web has many things to do. For example, facebook, twitter, and myspace are all social sites. Also there are video sites such as youtube. Plus @CAPS1 learn how to type fast. Social network sites are good for @CAPS1. Teens got to talk to each other, make new friends, and post what they want. For example, twitter you can post tweets, facebook you can join groups, and become a fan of something or someone, and myspace you can send messages. TEENS relieve a lot of stress on the web. Videos are great when your bored. Type in youtube and get a good laugh or two. Teens that go on youtube become more social. For example, teens can learn the new dance. Plus on video sites there are comedy. Comedy helps daily life. @CAPS2 helps life if you work in a office or a trademark. Teens learn to type to make life easier. For example @CAPS2 fast is like texting. @CAPS2 is like writing a letter electronically. So get to @CAPS2. Ok so computers do help life in teen years. Basically it is @CAPS3 somewhat.

1696,"Wouldn't you agree that computers are needed in our life. I would, we need computer for many things, for example we need computer for communications, we also need them to educate yourself and others. Next this is good for buyers and sellers. My first reason why I agree that computers benifits society is because of the communications. Now in our present day with all of our new technology many people use computers to communicate with friends or family. For example if you had a loved one in the military you could use the computer to communicate with him with a webcam. Computer could be a good way to talk and ask friends about homework assignments you @MONTH1 have missed as if you was absent. Also you could use computers to communicate with somebody selling something you @MONTH1 be or, you could get more detail about that product by talking to the owner of it through maybe email. My second reason would be education. Now a days many college students with work going on @MONTH1 not have time to attend schools so with the help of a computer they can take online classes. For some students instead of study in classroom all day they could be learning from computers and it could be more to the students so maybe they would understand topics better. like science for example when doing a lab you could research and do it on a computer. With computers students could learn more because they would have textbooks or maybe nothing and if they were interested in a topic they could research it and educate themselves. My third reason would be buying and selling products. Many people all over the world go on the internet to buy or sell products. Like ebay that is a website many people items on to make money and other people can buy them. So computers could be a good solution to making money and to also saving gas because people can order products online and have them shipped to there house instead of driving @CAPS1 from the I have told you like communications, education, and buying and selling products I hope you agree with me that computers do benifit society",4,5,0
1244,"Deear Newspaper, I think that the effects that computers are having on people is a @CAPS1 thing because most people just sit at the computers all day long. In this letter I am going to talk about the effects of computers on people, what we could be doing instead, and what person are doing on the computer. First thing is that computers are having a @CAPS1 effect on people and there life computers are making people just fit inside on their computers all day and do nothing. They just sit there playing games also about @PERCENT1 of the people who are spending to much time on the computer are probally pating well their on the computer which that is why some people @MONTH1 be fat. Most of the people who spend all of they time on the computer is people in there @NUM1's and @NUM2's some are in there @NUM3's or @NUM4's. Just sitting there on the computer will get you. Where in life. It will not give you a job or school education. By just sitting at the computer for a while you will not be able to do things out side. If so many people were not on the computer all the time then they could be outside. Being outside they can play sports, ride bikes, swim, run and more. They could also get a job and make some money or go to college, kids who are on the computer to much could get out and go to the mall, hang with friends you could get some exercise, or just enjoy nature. There is no use for going on the computer and being there for more then @NUM5 or @NUM6 hours, the most you should be on the computer would be an hour to an hour and a half. Kids and teenagers should only go on the computer for homework and the rest of the time doing something eles. Well all of the kids grade through @NUM7 grade should go out a play with their toys and people @NUM8 grade and up should hang out with and do thing like go to the mall, see a movie, or just have a sleepover. Also everyone in these grades should interact with there families more by seeing them more then @NUM7/@NUM8 times a month and they could have parties or just get together and hang out. So people should do some of the other things I said instead of just going on the computer all of the time. The last thing is the things that people are doing on the computers which is like I sometimes go on facebook. Other people go on facebook, google, games looking up information, and more. They also have emails where they chat with other people. Another thing people go on is youtube and listen to music and watch veidos. So I don't think that the effect of the computers on people is a good thing. I think that people shoud be out doing things then just sitting at home on the computer. People who sit at home on computers could and probally will get to fat. So the effect of computers on people is @CAPS1.",4,4,0
943,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers are a vital source for anyone's household. Many people have busy lives and having a computer at home make it easer. You can use it for research, organization, and business matters. I donÂ’t know what I would do without one. Education is very important especially in our economy today. The computer makes work and studying fast and simple. When you need to research a topc for school there is always an endless library of information @CAPS6 you turn on the computer. You @CAPS7 get your information from books, and encyclopedias but it is rare that you always have time, to get to a local library. Also, @CAPS6 you have a project in school that you need to type, it is helpful to have a computer at home so you don't have to use at short. This way, you have more time to get extra from teachers @CAPS3 on instrument in the school band. I can imagine that my grades would be @CAPS6 i did have access to the internet of @CAPS4 @CAPS5 at home. Have you over pare or document and had an of her and happens @CAPS6 you own a computer you can backup @CAPS7 you imagine on essay five pages and organized is boring, biut you wouldn't think so @CAPS6 it saved you from hours worth of writing! For some people, having a computer @CAPS7 make you money, and who wouldn't like more money? You can run a business online and avoid the hastle of manting a @CAPS8 your own space or building to run your business can be quite expensive and time-consuming. Also, you can refrain from making a trip from the store by purchasing items online. Then, the item will be shipped to your door. You save time and money on gas by doing so. And thise days, any way to save money is a good one! By having a computer you can boost your education.Keep yourself organized, and save money. Although it has many recreational purposes as well, it also can be very helpful in your life. And besides, is perfectly fine, to go online to talk to your friends once in a while, isn't it?",4,5,0
384,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you think computers have a possitive effect on people? I know I @CAPS2. Computers are good for many reasons: @NUM1 reason is because people can learn about far away places; @NUM2 they can talk to people and learn about their culture and @NUM3 they can teach hand eye coordination. First off if you're taking you want to learn about where you are going. Computers can help with that! Also if you want to find good hotels you can use the computer for that. If you need transportation just log onto google and type in what you're looking for. Now if you are doing a project for school or something on a different area of the world you can log onto your skype, facebook, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, or any other website that you. You can @CAPS2 many things while talking to freinds on the internet, such as: find out school assignments, find out due dates, make dates and many more wonderfull things. Hand-eye coordination is very important. Computers can help with that. Drivers need very good hand-eye coordination; if you don't have that then plan on a big insurece bill. If you don't have good hand eye coordination then you are going to have a hard time with a lot of stuff. So thats why computers are a good thing to have in our society. You can learn about where you are going, stuff that you need to get done, and even become a better driver.",4,4,0
15,"Dear, In this world today we should have everyone useing computers. Computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. Today computers are like the worlds biggest book of knowledge. everything you need to know is in a computer. You can look up faraway places, and zap theres everything you need to know write in front of you. Computers are fast and easy, everyone can use them. Today kids are so addicted to computers everyday they are on them. There are so many websites that kids and teens go on, like @CAPS1, and facebook ect. on these websites kids as young as ten years old are chatting with friends and putting up pictures. Thers is also webchat websites that allow you to use a webcame and talk to people anywhere in the world. Computers are a great way to get in touch with people. Everyone should have a computer in there home today.",3,3,0
187,"Dear,newspaper I think that people should have computers I think that because kids play game to help them learn like math game or read and grown ups can go on websites and watch work out videos and they could pay there bills on the computer to and they dont have it in the store of kids need to do there homework computers are good for that buy thet also have bad stuff like kids say they are doing there homework but they are on youtube myspace or facebook. or other stuff but computers have more good stuff about them they bad things so that? Why I think we should have computers.",3,2,0
324,"I think computer have shaped @LOCATION1 to what it is today. Computer help people learn, give people a passtime, and all of that can be managed in a certain space of time so you still have time to go outside. Computers help everyone learn. It makes things easier by typing up essays because you could type it faster and its eaiser to make changes. Also, its cheaper to buy a computer and go on the internet and look up foreign countries then acually going there. Another example, is that a computer teachees you hand-eye coordination from typing and using the mouse. Finally, computers can teach you life lessons by reading articles another person wrote. Computers give bored people passtimes. One example, is that you can play computer games during rainy days or when you can't go outside. Also, you can talk to friends through facebook or aim. Another example, is that you can talk to distant family in another country by using programs such as skype. Finally, you can order stuff online instead of wasting gas and going to the store and the things you might order you can play with outside. A lot of people say computers keep kids inside don't know that their are ways to prevent this. One example is you can use shut-off timers that keep anyone from going onto the computer for to long. Also, many people learn how to manage their time on the computer. Another example, is that parents can make rules that their children aren't allowed to play games on the computer on certain days and/or times. Finally, you can keep the computers in the family room so that children don't play with it all night in their room. Those are just some of the many reasons why computer help @CAPS1. They help us learn, pass the time, and it can all be manage during a certain amount of time. Now reading this I hope you believe that computers benefit society.",4,4,0
107,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed, and you needed to do a presentation? Well if so, that means you probably had to do your presentation on paper, the old fashioned way. Recently, there @CAPS1 been a debate going on between experts about computers. Some think they make your life more efficient while others think they make you spend too much time on them rather than outdoors. I believe that computers make our lives easier and that the advances in technology have a positive effect on people. I think this because it teaches you skills and updates you on info. around the world, it's efficient for work and helps the environment, and lastly, it let's people stay in touch. Computers have a positive effect on people because it let's family members stay in touch. Emails are an example of this. Instead of mailing a letter, you are electronically sending it. The person recieves it quicker and can answer ina more timely manner. Also, social networking sites help families keep in touch. One example of this is facebook. You can see what the person is doing and chat with them using facebook chat. I relate to this. My cousin lives in @LOCATION2, so I don't see him a lot. Through facebook, we can talk and update each other on our lives. Lastly, you can see pictures of your family. Many families have accounts on photo sharing sites. This enables them to see pictures or recent vacations or sporting events. They can comment and every member of the family can see how everyone looks/changes throughout the year. That is how computers let people stay in touch. Another reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it teaches you skills and updates you on information. Computers teach you hand-eye coordination. When you type with a keyboard, you have to know where each letter is. This makes it possible to lok at the screen to recognize my errors. Hand eye coordination is a good skill for everyone to know. Computers update you on world news. Many homepage on the internet have news engines built into them. These news engines keep people updates on major news events. For example, the war in @LOCATION5, or more recently, the @LOCATION3 and @LOCATION4 earthquakes. Without the internet, we would be very behind on important news updates around the world. My last reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because it is efficient for work and they help the environment. Computers help the environment because you are not using as much paper. Throughout the year, @CAPS2 use billions of sheets of paper to write letters. With computers that number goes down into the thousands. Why you @MONTH1 ask? Emails don't recquire paper. They are electronic, which means no paper. They are also environmentally friendly because news paper companies are going out of buisness. Due to online news paper news is becoming less and less popular. Computers are efficient for work because it is so easy to make presentations. There are so many programs to use, that making a big presentation could take minutes. That is why computers make work easy but help the environment at the same time. As you can see, computers have many positive effect on people. They let family members stay in touch, they teach you skills, and they are efficient for work while being environmentally friendly. That is why I believe computers have a positive effect on people. Let me ask you this question again. @CAPS1 your computer ever crashed when you needed to do a big project? Now you know that computers make life efficient. What would you do without them? So now it's your turn, go out and buy a computer because you will be thankful you did.",5,5,1
1325,"Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1 has been a discussion around the @LOCATION1 for decades now. People cannot agree on whether computers are a good privelage to the society or just bumping it down year after year. I think computers do have a positive effect on people. This is because they teach hand-eye coordination, give them knowlege about cultures around the world, and allow people to communicate with one another. Do you think the downsides really outweigh these positives? Hand-eye coordination is not something you are born with. You gain it as you get older and acheive practive. Computers help with this goal. ""@PERCENT1 of people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 frequently, have been horrible at catching a baseball before going on the @ORGANIZATION1, and after have caught every time."" says biologist @PERSON1. And it not only helps with baseball, but with other sports such as juggling, golf or tennis. If you get very good at these sports, you can play them for fun, or even as a proffessional. Who knew that playing on the @ORGANIZATION1 could get you so far in life?! Did you know, according to ""Time"" magazine, that people who go on the @ORGANIZATION1 are better able to focus on tasks, such as schoolwork, because it enables your hands and eyes to work together as one? And everyone knows that if you get good grades in school, almost any job you could be qualified in? Then, you can earn a good amount of money, and live your dream life!! Oh, great another @NUM1 hour day of school. Hhmm. What do I have first block? @LOCATION3 history. What? Yes! We're doing a culture project! That means I can easily go on the @ORGANIZATION1 and find out great things about what place I'm assigned. That's another up-put about computers. Easy access to tons of useful information. I have cheerleading everyday after school until @NUM2. If I have a project, I don't have hours and hours to look in books and find out what I need to know. Computers allow me to do my sport and still get a good grade in school. @PERCENT2 of people use computers to do their informational work about faraway places. It is faster and more accurate. You could just search through your bookshelf to find an almanac. But once you find it, you would need to check the copyright. Hopefully it's recent. If not, you're in trouble. Would you feel like prying through more shelves to be acccurate? Facebook, @CAPS1, @CAPS2. All new ways to communicate with people. Just another useful effect on people. Forgot to write down your homework? Hopefully your friend didn't and you can just ask them. ""@PERCENT3 of people don't chat with others online."" says @LOCATION2 @ORGANIZATION1 expert. Most of it has to be for some reason or another. Such as homework, what happened that day, or how they haven't seen eachother in forever. Don't you chat with people online? Trust me, it can be a gradesaver. Maybe this will help you conclude that computers give a positive effect on society because of handeye coordination, information, and chatting. What would we do without them?",5,5,1
1627,"Dear local Newspaper, I think using a computer has become bad influence on modern society. When people talk to each other via text message or e-mail there is no emotional sense. You are blind a way because you can't see who's on the other side of the screen, @CAPS1 you know is the username of that person. Its practically the same as using a disguise. Not only is the computer dad for your healthy. Its become a threat to its user. Would you really want to use something that bad toward your health and your privacy? Statistics show that @PERCENT1 of teenangers have access to/and use the internet more than three times a week. Statistics also so that more than half of teenagers in the @CAPS2.S.A spend more than @NUM1 hours on a computers, some even @NUM2 hours! This has become the addiction of the world. My friend barely used a computer and always played outside. When his sister showed him @CAPS3, @CAPS4, myspace, @CAPS5, etc. He would stay on for hours and after a month, it didn't get better, day after day he began to come outside less and less, and I began to hate him fo that. Statistics show that people who are using computers excessively tend to have drop in their grades. People are mixed in to these machines they become anti-social, don't do homework, potentially fail the unit and reappeat the grade. Computers are the same as watching tv, sure! they teach hand to eye coordination but at the same time their brains are being turned into swiss cheese. I believe computers are the best idea, since pouring gasoline on pancakes. ",4,4,0

And computers can help you with school a lot and you can print out lots of things and why computers can help you is with your math writing spelling and most defyntly is science and ant also literature. The reason why I chose those @NUM1 things is because you can look those @NUM1 things up on. Computer and get the answer to math and spelling right like read @NUM3 helps you write and spell thats one at the reasons why I like computers because I can get on read @NUM3 and I love doing read @NUM3 a lot and I like the read @NUM3 class also because the computers sometimes I like reading on the computers but not all the time but I have to read that's how I'll first learn how to read by forsing my self forward to read.

1073,"To my opinion computers have a negative effect on people I think it has a negative because it causes people to get less exercise you spend less time with your family and friends and it distracts you from things get done. First of all computers have a negative effect on people because it causes them to get exercise. For example, there are many football, soccer and baseball games practicingg these they will just computer on the webcam all night. Another way is that you can get work done. WIthout even leaving your house. You can shop online, stay home and work online, and even go to college those things include getting out around, but now you can just day and do those things and be lazy. Second, the computer causes you to interact with people less. Now, when family or friends. i went over my I sat right and she didn't even look at me playing computer games. i know that a lot more kids too because I was reading in a magazine that @PERCENT1 of interacting with their kids as much as they got a computer. Lastly, i think the computer has a negative effect because it them. It distracts kids conversations first of all when people to talk with someone on the computer it is very hard because, they are absorbent in they're doing. Secondly, the computer distracts kids from homework. I know this first hand, because wherever I have in type up assignments I get and end up going on different websites, and not getting my work done. lastly, it distracts kids from household chores. Some kids just put them to the side and forget to do them because they're budy playing game or surfing the web. i know that if I did I'd get in big trouble. Those are the reasons why I think the computer has a negative effect on people. Because, it causes them to get less exercise, they don't interact with people, as much, and it distract them. So unless you want all those things happening to you, I suggest you spend less those on the computer!",4,4,0

Most of all @CAPS2 gets really adicting for a lot of people that they dont spend time with thie familys or sibleings and some kid get so adicted that they come from school and start useing the computer all day and dont study for a test or do home work. Now people spend so much time on the computer that they dont exersize or play sports with thier friends and just sit all day and get lazy and fat just because of the computer. We just need the computer just to chek @CAPS3 and facebook like I do but I just check my facebook and the go play basket ball.

1757,"I belive the reason why people use the computer so much is because most people might have to work on the comptuer or mabey even finish a project. But I understant the part when the artical said ""Some experts are concerned that people are spending to o much time on their computes and less exercising"". Mostly young teens use the computer at a earley age and become hooked, because there are so many things to do on the computer like download games for free and play with other. People around the world but you would think that anybody would play video game on the computer and have free time? NO! Most adults don't play games on the computer, they do work or reasearch an artical. But after that they'll continue doing their daily routine, but alot of teens are on the computer everyday and rarley get exercise. The internet has open alot of new enchanced technology, over the past few years you could search up old friends from mabey old schoold on the web or even chat with people who you don't know from all over the world. You could have an @NUM1 @CAPS1 and buy new song or new albums insted of going to a local store, or even shop online have have the cloths been brought to you.

523,"Dear @CAPS1, I - like many other people my age - love to sit in front of a computer and explore it's wonders. But that does not mean that I spend my whole life on it like others. So I can see what too much computer time can do. It has made kids my age more aggressive, have health problems, and care even less about the environment. More and more kids are falling into those traps. Too much computer time can make even the nicest person extremely aggressive. I know from past experience that when you bother people when they are on their obsession, they will snap at you, yell, or even start swearing at you, or maybe get violent. If someone stays up to late on the computer, the next day could mean that they're cranky from the lack of sleep. This aggression @MONTH1 cause others to get aggressive in response, which @MONTH1 lead to a verbal or physical fight, which (hopefully) nobody wants. Another issue too much computer time can cause, @CAPS1, are even more health issues. Staying inside all day will keep people from getting the neccessary amount of vitamin @CAPS3 they need which is a vital nutricious vitamin that comes from the sun itself. Not getting enough vitamin @CAPS3 throughout a person's childhood can result in getting an illness called @CAPS5 later in life, which never truly goes away and hinders people from doing the things they love. Too much computer time also means people aren't getting enough exercise, and with the way we eat now, those two things can add up to making a person obeie. Others who do not want to get the proper amount of exercise or eat right and at the same time do not want to become obeisce, @MONTH1 to anorexia. Neither or these weight problems are very good for you, proving my point about the health issues of too much computer time. The issue I will have you read @CAPS1, is how people will become even less caring of the environment. Some of the big technology companies side-step around environmental protection laws to find cheaper ways to make their products and the thing is, no one cares! No one cares so long as they get their newer and better piece of technology. Everyone will just keep protecting these companies to get what they want to satisfy the craving for more computers. Now, I'm not saying that having any computer time is bad. I'm just trying to prove that too much is bad for you. That with too much computer time, people can become more aggresive, have health issues, and become even less caring of the environment. Therefore I urge you @CAPS1 to write an article in the newspaper about the effects of too much computer time, to make it known to everyone in the city. It might help us make a better future.",5,5,1
164,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you think computers have a positive or negative effect on people? I personally think computers have a positive effect on people because with computers many people @CAPS1 research about the past. Also I don't agree that computers have a negative effect on anybody because with computers many people learn hand-eye coordinations, gives them the ability to learn about faraway people and places, they also allow people to talk to old friends or family members. Then, computers can also be used to help someone find information about nature such as different trees, plants, animals, and many other things that are involved in nature. After that, computers are also sometimes used to contact people who live faraway from you. Some ways to contact people on a computer are using e-mails, instant message, facebook, myspace, and many other websites. In addition, I think computers have a positive effect on people, but others maya not agree which is fine because not everybody has the same opinion on stuff in the world. Then, computers can be very useful to many people because they can use computers if they need to find information on history, any events that might have went on in the past that might not still be done in the present. Finally, computers are useful to scientists, business workers, many adults, and even children use computers if they need to type something for school or need to find information for a project they're doing.",4,4,0
1108,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 you can see, about @PERCENT1 of our population over use the computer. They should be out getting fresh air and spending time with their family and friends. On the other hand, the computer can come with much use. For many people. Family lives quite a distance away, @CAPS1 well @CAPS1 some friends and getting out of touch is a possibility. You can also learn about far away places, like @LOCATION1. The computer is often used for projects essays which is important. You can learn quite a bit with a computer. The computer can be used in many ways. One way is to keep in contact. Sure you can just go to the park and spend time there but not everybody live that close. For people who have relatives or even good friends who live quite a distance, a computer is what you @CAPS2. It is a great way to keep in contact. You can keep everyday updated at all times. For example, my cousin recently went out of the country for college she will be there for a few months so she has her own blog on the computer to keep everybody update and stay in contact. The phone is not always an option. To learn about far away places is great. Online you can learn about the history of specific places. You can see the towns and so much more. You can even see pictures. Maybe one day you will even get to see those specific places in person. How cool would that be? School is a big thing now-a-days. Students have project after project assay after essay and its a lot of work. @CAPS1 you grow older it becomes more work and with a computer, you will have less weight on your shoulders. With essays you can type them, and fix your mistakes without it looking sloppy. Projects are easy to fix to: so messing up isn't a big deal. On the other hand, more americans now than ever before are over weight. The computer has a lot to do with that. Most people will come home and sit on the computer for the rest of the evening. They don't realize what a big effect a computer can make on a person. More people should be out exercising. Spending time with family. Computers can be negative thing or positive. It can be more helpful than you could imagine. But, yet it can make a huge negative effect on people. It can help keep contact with people to learn about far away places, or even school work.

1500,"Dear local Newspaper editor, More and more people are using computers, but not everyone thinks that is such a good idea. Those who support advances in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Other experts disagree. I think that computers do have a positive effect on people because they let you learn about anything all over the world, they let you talk online with other people, and teach hand eye coordination. I think that computers are very helpful. Dont you love having the oppritunity to research anything from any part of the world that you want to learn about? I'm sure that everyone who has a computer does. With computers, you can use search engines like, google, yahoo, ask, and so many more. I know that computers help me with research all the time when I do projects or write papers for school. The internet is a great, reliable that you cango to when researching a topic for shcool or even just looking for an answer to a simple question. My next reason is that computers let you talk to other people online. Things like facebook, email, myspace, and web-caming all let you communicate with people anywhere in the world. For example, I have an aunt that lives in @LOCATION1, and on christmas me and my family used my cousins webcam to see her and talk to her when we couldnt be with her on a special holiday. Also, things like facebook and myspace let you put up pictures and chat with friends and family all over the world. My last reason why I think computers have a positve effect on people is that playing on the computer is a good leisure time activity. There are all kinds of fun games you can play, and some even let you compete with other people around the world. For example, internet checkers is a game that lets you compete against someone else. There are so many websites that let you pick games you want to play out of a huge selection. Its obvious that computers have a positive effect on people for research, talking to friends & family and leisure activities. I hope you agree with me!",4,4,0

It can be a good thing because you can learn something new every minute, you can also interact with your friends on it, lastly you can do things at the same time hang with your friends and getting exercise. Every minute you are on the computer you can learn something new! For example, let's say that you are on a gaming sights playing a game and suddenly an advertisement appears. It will most likely give you knowledges about the advertisement you are watching. Also study shows that everytime you are on a computer for atleast @NUM1 minutes you can learn something new you spend your . Even way for them to communicate is via internet/computer.

551,"Dear local news paper I think the computers benefits society. The three reason why so is because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the abilit to learn about faraway places, and allow people to talk onlone with other people, and computers help to make better technology. I belive that computers have positive effect on people. My first reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the abilit to learn about faraway places. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students use the computers to do homework. I was visiting a prompt last week. I ddn't know alot abou @LOCATION1 so I whent on the computers and you know what i got to know more about @LOCATION1 and things to the computers I got a A+. So the computers have a positive effect on people. The next reason why computers have a positive effect on people is because computers allow people to talk online with other poeple. Say if a man whant to a and he left his phone at home how will he take to his family why he had computers he can talk to his family online. My family is back in @LOCATION1 I haven't see them in four years so I whant to the stor and get a wedcan and i get to see my family afdter four years. So computers do have a positive effect on people. My last reason why computers have a benefits in society is because computers help to make better technology. Computers help people to make better car, light, an so on. Without computers society is because computers help the soldiers to win wars and even help people to live. My father was dying without computer my father would die thang to computer I have father today. In the end computer have the benefits in society the three reason is computers teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway place, and computers allow people to talk online with other people and computers help people to make better technology. Spending time enjoying nature is good computers have benfits society better. I hope my three reason can persuade the local news paper to agree with my position that computer have a positive effect on people.",4,4,0
1021,"I think that it is fine that people spend a lot of time on the computer instead of having time to exercise, enjoy nature and interact with family and friends because it is the persons choice to either stay on the computer all day or go outside. Computers affect peoples lives in good ways and bad ways. People stay inside all day and do nothing besides sit there and just click buttons. Good ways is that it educates you in many ways because @CAPS1 your on the computer watching or reading interesting things you could end up learning something before you learn it in school. Its good to go on the computer for a little a bit but @CAPS1 your on it all day then you could have no exercise and become lazy and fat. But @CAPS1 you go outside sometimes you wont have to worry because you are getting exercise that helps out your body. I think computers are a great way to have fun. You can chat with your friends, @CAPS1 you have a webcam you can video chat with friends. A cmputer is a great way for communication. Millions of people use a computer for working at their @CAPS2. Without computers life would be ten times harder for people in this world. People like accountants use computer for there job. They store data into the computer to remember things @CAPS1 you couldn't write it down on a piece of paper, People also make websites on the internet to help educate, like @CAPS1 you type in a word it could give you a definition, People also make @CAPS4 engines, @CAPS4 engines are some engine on a website that searches for things you type in. @CAPS1 you type in something you will get what you were looking for. My whole point of explaining this is that its the peoples choice @CAPS1 they would like to be on all the time. Because computers and internet connections arn't free. It doesn't even do anything bad to your brain. It mostly educates it. People even go to school online they learn and study on things that are on the internet. Plus you could get @CAPS2 at places for working with computers, You could make programs, and anything you would want. So my statement here is that its okay to spend alot of time on your computer instead of exercizing going to see friends and family and enjoy nature. I think that computers are fine and it doesn't matter how long your on it, it just depends @CAPS1 your learning and not playing games all day and being lazy and get fat.",4,5,0
1137,"Dear: @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think computer are one of the most @CAPS3 inventions ever. They help education make everything @CAPS4 and traveling is @CAPS4. It helps education because @CAPS5 always use computers to help kids learn important information. for example if we have to study for something there are websites specialy made for studing. Also there are sites to teach little kids how to read or write. Allmost all @CAPS5 have computers these days. Some @CAPS5 even give computers to kids so they can use it to study. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS5 in the @CAPS7.S use computers more than textbooks and get high test scores. Thats why computers help education. A second reason is it generally makes everything @CAPS4. For example instead of writing an essay for school and having it take hours than your hand is and to findout its filled with miss-spelled words. Instead you can type it quick and use spell check. I have never heard one person say that the computer hasn't make life @CAPS4. Another example is if you had to find some information on you new dog. Instead of goind to your library spending minutes.You can simply open up you internet and then search it and find the info you need in seconds. That's why the computer make every thing @CAPS4. The last reason is that one. Traveling is such a without a computer With out it you have to go to to buy tickets. In fact I don't even remember what it was like to not @CAPS9 online with a computer all you have to do is go to the parts websites and then but it from there its so easy areselfs to places but traveling mail to each other also. I haven't sent a @CAPS8 card in years. Instead I @CAPS9 email. It quicker, @CAPS4 and more reliable. That is why traviling people and mail is @CAPS4. Over all the computer is one of the most helpful things ever and with technology upgraing daily soon it will be even @CAPS4 to do things. While too much computer is bad and people souldn't @CAPS9 interact with internet. The computer games in handy almost all the time. That is why i think the computer is @CAPS3.",4,4,0
1717,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1 and I want to argue about the issue of computer use in @LOCATION1, @CAPS3, I'll tell you about the benefits of owning a computer. Then, I'll talk about the whole computer network. Finally, I'll talk about the advances in technology due to the computer. I think the use of computers in our town are very good for society. There are the major benefits of using a computer. @CAPS3 is the fact you can use microsoft to write up a paper. Sixth grader @PERSON6 says, ""I would rather type than write a paper. Another reason to use a computer is a for research."" @CAPS4 many articles and facts are online about anything you need,"" says @PERSON4. The final benefit of a computer is the fact you can know about world news in a flash. ""I would've never known about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 without seeing the article on @CAPS2 homepage,"" says @PERSON5. Those are just some of the major benefits that the kids do on their computer. Now lets talk about something. That is said to be bad but really isnt; social networking. Stuff like @CAPS5 use a texting form on a computer which helps us connect without making a huge phone bill: with instant messanger I can talk to @CAPS2 girlfriends,"" says @PERSON2. Also, there is facebook which can help us connect on a global stage. ""I can talk with @CAPS2 cousin in @LOCATION2,"" says @CAPS6. Those are the major social networking tools we use to talk to people around the world. One thing that is important about the computer is the advances in technology caused by it. @CAPS3, we have the laptop which is a portable computer we can take anywhere. ""I can use @CAPS2 computer anywhere I like,"" says @PERSON7. Also, the memory card which allows us to save data on a computer and take it to school or work. Eigth grader @CAPS7 says, ""I can take work I didn't finish in school home with the stick."" The final major advance is the use of the printer,"" I use @CAPS2 printer to print of papers to bring to school,"" @PERSON3 said. Those are some of the major advances caused by the computer. That's why I think using the computer is good for us. There is many benefits to owning a computer. We talk to people world-wide when ever we want to. The computer has even been the sole purpose for many other ground breaking improvements in technology. @CAPS4 please help defend us kids in this case about computer use.",4,4,0
1642,"Dear local newspaper, Technology is an important part of everyday living even some people's lifestyle without technology, more specifically, computers, mankind would be lost. We wouldn't be able to learn about faraway places and people research things with a wider range of information available or for some people, talk to friends and family. Technology i needed in everyone's life they realize this or not. There is an endless amount of things you can do on the computer and as far as advances in technology this is only the beginning. The internet allows people to learn-and more than just what you would get from a book at the library. You can learn about the culture of @LOCATION1, the food they eat in @LOCATION2, or even the way people dress in @LOCATION3. You can find pictures and of faraway places and find out the currency or of a country. The possibilities @CAPS1 computer allow you to do is research. When maybe they through them giving a presentation much easier! Furthermore the computer enables people to comunicate with others. For some, this is their only way of communication. If you have a penpal in @CAPS1 state, or maybe even @CAPS1 country, e-mail is a great way to talk to them it's quick, easy, and enjoyable tool others, however, prefer instant messaging - the message you type pops up almost instantly on the others computer. Then they type a response and it comes back to you! Either method is a great way of communication! So you see, without technology we would not be able to learn everything we'd like to, research for, say on for language arts class. We not even be able to communicate with some others. And this is only the beginning of what our lives would like without the computer.",4,4,0
1587,"Dear editor, I think that people are spending too much time on the computer. Because of this, people are getting less exersice, they are not spending enough time outdoors and the dont spend as much time with their family and friends. Exersicing is an important part of one's daily schedued. I have a friend who exersices everyday. She is the healthiest person I know and rarely spends anytime on the computer. But, she knows someone who is almost her compleate oposite. He hardly ever exersices and spends @NUM1 hours on the computer each day. He has also been diagnosed with diabeties and is obese. These are the type of health problems that are faced because of lack of exersice and too much computer time. Experts say that people should get at least @NUM2 minutes of exersice every day. But, because more and more people are spending time on computers, this is almost impossible. Studies done at @ORGANIZATION1 show that @PERCENT1 of kids under the age of @NUM3 are obese or at the risk of becaming obese because they are not getting enough exersice. You don't want that number to increase do you? There are other problems that people face because of too much time on the computer. People are spending less time outdoors and more time inside at a desk. My friend @PERSON1 spends way too much time on her computer and not enough outside. She failed a science poject because she was on her computer, rathern than outside comparing the leaves from different trees. Doctor @PERSON2 is a child phycologist and when he asked kids if they would rather play outside or be on a computer, @PERCENT2 of them said computer. This shows that people on computers are not only young, but they want to be on the computer more than be outside. This is a number that, in my opinion, is too high. Lastly, there is the problem of people not spending enough time with their family and friends. By this I mean face to face time, not just video chatting with your friends on facebook. This has caused tension in relationships. My friend @PERSON3 didn't go to her family reunion but stayed at home on the computer and at the next family get together, she was ostrisized because she didn't go to the reunion. High @ORGANIZATION1 guidance counselor @PERSON4 says that @NUM4 out of @NUM5 friendships are ruined because kids dont spend enough face to face time with their friends but are on the computer. These are all god reasons why less time on the computer and more time exersicing, outside, and with family and friends will make your life happier and healthier.",5,5,1
1189,"Proven by @PERSON2 the best @CAPS1 major over @PERCENT1 of children either have desktops, laptops, or some type of internet access. What so you think about this? Well I the computers are takeing up people time (like children) and not letting them get their work done. Also, computer are not only letting people talk to their friend, but its causing @CAPS5 bullying. Finally, @CAPS1 are also just maken parents more stressed out because the have to pay another bill for internet. Children now and days come home change and log right into the computer and start talking to friends and lisening to music all this sounds good intell their report cards come back and they see they are failing half there classes. I remember when my friend @CAPS3 would go home change eat and log right inside the computer. As days went around the end or the year was she noticed she had two problems. She was getting over weight and she was failing all her classes. She noticed that getting on the computer was not neccesary so for the next mouth and a half she cut down on her time on the @CAPS1 did her homework and started this pushed me to beleave that children have @CAPS1. Proven by @PERSON3 the syber bully that over @PERCENT2 of children have bin syber bullyed or @CAPS5 bulllied someone. All this happen when children are not being watched or get bored and to pick on someone. What should we do people ask @PERSON1 and she says well take away the @CAPS1. I remember when I read about the year old girl on new channels.com and it was about @CAPS5 bullied but never. This shows that children all over the world can be getting syber bullied of any moment.",4,5,0

Yo know why we pick this side because are three reasons why computers are good. Like number one they teach people about far away places and people, @CAPS1 computers are a good sorce of entertainment, and last but not least @CAPS1 computers are good chat room. When @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 are finished telling you why these three reason are good the peoples @CAPS1 computer will win this war! First reason is do you like wasting time walking though the library looking for places or @ORGANIZATION1 people. Well if you have a computer you do not have to deal with these all you have to do is go to sarch and put these person or place name and you will see that in less than a min you have information that will take hours to find in a library. I know this because it happen to me looking for a book that talks about the @CAPS2 caladers. I could not find I had to go on a computer for the information. Secound reason why because computers are a good sorce of entertainment. You know if you got bord and you have computer you can easily just go on it and play so many fun games like @CAPS3 @CAPS4, dragonwars, or any fun game that you can find on a computer. There are so many games to chosse from that you will never get borad. Third reason is the computer is a fun way of talking to friends or family. Like are so many sites that you can chosse to talk to friend or family like @CAPS5, @CAPS6 or even @ORGANIZATION2. Also did you know you can send videos or even pictures of stuff to friends or family. So go on a computers and talk to your friend even that person a picture or something.

1147,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 staff, Are computers helpful to us regularly? Computers are very helpful machines that increase productivity daily. Computers not only help people discover @ORGANIZATION1 places and learn more about other parts of the world, but also computer allow people to communicate with others around the world. In addition, computers have word processor and other applications that help workers do their jobs daily. So, now do computers help people learn more about our earth? Many teachers and students use computers daily to help them teach. There are many online websites that help students discover and process different areas around the world. For example, there is a @LOCATION1 website (www.canadamaps.org) and this website has a map and students have to match the place/area onto the map. There are also website such as mapquest & yellowpages to help people navigate cross country and around town. As you can see, computers also help students education and just our everyday life. A large amount of teenagers of all ages like to use a programs on computers called @CAPS1. @CAPS1 stands for @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This program allows people of all ages to talk with their friends or colleages instantly. What one does, is type in a chat box to someone and the message is instantly sent to the person. Emailing is used for many things. To catch up with friends, or to talk something with another. One can also attach documents that @MONTH1 consist. Emailing helps things go faster as well as your computers. But, if your newspaper were written out by hand, then that would take a lot of time, people, paper, & money. As you can even see, @ORGANIZATION1, computers are a necessity! So, as you can see computers really are needed. Computers affect us in many ways that aren't noticed clearly or easily. Like I said, computers teach and help people learn about different places among the world today, helps us communicate with others around us or in @LOCATION2! And as well, allow us to bring our work, family, friends, and cases everywhere we, in addition to computers allowing us to word process papers so our lives are ease for our everyday life.

1544,"I People spend too much time on the computer. A lot of people are on the computer for about the whole day. They should be spending time with family and friends. People never have enough time for activities. Also computer should mostly be used for talking with family and friends, homework,research, games @CAPS1 bored, and work. To begin with, people need to spend more time with family and friends rather than on the computer. For example @CAPS1 your mother or father asked you @CAPS1 you wanted to go out to dinner and you said no, I'm on the computer, that would just mean your obsessed with going on the computer. A lot of families are bing broken apart because people spend too much time on the computer @CAPS1 you have a friend over and they say I am bored and all you are doing is play games on the computer than that is just being rude because your friend is bored. So you need to get off the computer and spend time with your loved ones. Previously I stated how people spend time with loved ones, well people need to spend more time doing activities as well. A lot of humans sit on the computer and eat so over the time they eventually get fat. @CAPS1 you are gaining weight because your on the computer than you need to go do some activite to off that fat. @CAPS1 you are a teen and you are given the idea to play a sport and you it because computer is more important then is some serious obesession with the computer. As a result, the computer should be used wisely. The computer should be used to talk to family and friends, homework, research, work, and @CAPS1 you bored play some games little games on the computer. Those are probably the most important things that should most likely used for the computer. A lot of these things that I have listed are important because @CAPS1 you go on the computer just to be on and watch people talk then what's the point of wasting your time on the computer when you could be doing much more different things on the computer. For example, @CAPS1 you have homework such as vocabulary and you need definitions you can go to www.dictionary.com to find them, or @CAPS1 you just need to define a simple word. In conclusion, people spend too much time on the computer. They need to be spending more time with family and friends. Also people need to be doing more activities in their lives. Lastly, you should use the computer for useful things like homework or even very important research. So, as you can see humans spend too much time on the computer rather than doing much more important things.",5,5,1

About @PERCENT1 of people learn hand-eyes coordination using a computer. @CAPS3 might takes some month to learn, but once a child knows @CAPS3, they will be outside for hours.

Some believe, that computers have negative effets on people for example spending too much time, not exercising, and not interacting with family and friends. However, I believe computers have a positive effect on people because it teaches hand-eye coordination, lets people know about faraway places, and allows people to talk online. To conclude, computers have a positive effect on people. Did you know hand-eye coordination can be helpful at times? Well, it true because if you are in distress and the phone is broken and you don't have a cellphone then send an emergency e-mail to one of your friends informing them to call all and since you have hand-eye coordination you can type without having to look down. Also if your in college and have an important essay due tomorrow then hand-eye coordination can really help you write down notes without having to look back at the writing paper. Finally, with hand-eye coordination it can help you can join the army because if you spot a threat you can aim and shoot quickly without having to take out the gun after threat attacks. To conclude, computers teaches hand-eye coordination. Have you ever wanted to go to a forgein places? Well with computers you can do that you can just search the place and see what the place has. Fethermore, if you want to learn to speak a forgein language you can all you have to do is type in the language with a question and search its so easy a baby can do it. Finally, if you want to learn how to cook like forgein places do then type in the type of food or its name and search. To summarize, computers lets people know about forgein places. Have you ever have the feeling that you want to talk to somebody? I know I have this is why computers can help you talk to people online just tree the person's e-mail adresses and type the message. Also you don't have to waste money on paper and envelopes. Finally, having an e-mail is free so you can talk all you want. To conclude, computers help people talk online.

182,"Dear local newspaper, I think more people shouldn't spent time on their computer. The reasons why I think this is because people should spend time with their family and friends, second they need to exercis more, and last go outside enjoy nature. My first reason is that people that have computers stay in their rooms all day and don't get fresh air. They need to go out and enjoy nature. People who love animals and like to study animals should go out and get fresh air watch the animals study them. Haveing a computer is you could study animals like that is ok but you dont want to got stuck on the computers. go outside and watch them instead of looking at the computer screen. My second reason is that people do get more exercis. People are getting fat because they are sitting at the computer and not doing any movement. Peple are becoming lazy every day because they are on the computers @NUM1. Is you like to be on the computer and study go for a walk, run, joy, or ride a bike to the get some so a while. My last reason is that more people need to interact with their friends and family. People should get off the computer and make some plans with their family.Have a get together with your family and go places and chill. People who be on the computers don't spend time with there family dont know whats going on around them. Some people go into depresion because they are on the computers not enough time with family.

I also feel that it is good @CAPS5 for people to communicate with ther family and friends who live far away. Lastly, I think that computers provide us with fun activities, entertainment, and a @CAPS5 to relax. What do you do when you want to know what the capital of @LOCATION3 is? You either go break out the old atlas, or, with a simple click of a button on the computer, discover that the capital is @LOCATION4. My point is that with computers, finding information is fast and easy. Also, with computers you can share information as well as receive it. Lets say that you are not a doctor but have discovered a cure for the common cold by using iteams find in everyone's households. What do you do? Well, you could go to the media and do interview after confrence after interview, or, you could simply post it on the @CAPS1. It is plain to see that the computer in an important not in the process of exchanging information. ""I'm sorry @PERSON2, but we can't fly out to @LOCATION1 to see @CAPS2 @PERSON1. We don't have enough money."" I think that everyone has heard a variation of that line at least once. But here comes the computer to the rescue! With computers @CAPS2 @PERSON1 over in @LOCATION2 level is just a click (and or screen) away. By using webcams, you can speak with someone across the world without having to worry about the expensive costs of flights! No webcam? No problem! You can send someone very far away a message through e-mail or instant messaging. Say ""bye"" to expensive phre rides, long phone bills, or years going by seeing a loved one. Computers are,not just tools that are used strictly for, computers can be used for purposes as weel. In other words, computers can be used for fun! How exactly does the make computers have a creative on society? I'll tell you how. Many @CAPS4 are workaholics, also known as people who warr @CAPS5 to much. After a long day of signing papers and fiddling with a budget, wouldn't it be nice to just sit down and play some solitare? Thats possible with a computer, and you don't even need a deck of cards! Computers are full of fun games, like solitare and chess. These games are a great @CAPS5 to help people relax, and trust me, everyone needs relaxation. Having some downtime can really help someone to be a healthier and happier person! Aren't computers great? They can let us to exchange information talk to family and friendss across the globe(without a big pore tag), and they provide us with entertainment. So everyone out there could does not like the effect of the computers have on the public, please reconsider. Computers really are a helpful, fun, and useful tool to society.",4,5,0

What if your teacher tells you that a report is due tomorrow? What are you going to do, you don't have time to go to the library. I would go on the computer and get all the information I need. I would also use a computer to learn about far away places, or even famous people in history. I also could look up where I'm going on vacation and then I could learn more information about it. Like, you could find where the best resturant locations are, the best holers, and even the best tourist spots. Computers are also helpful for chating. My grandparents moved so I don't talk to them that much anymore, but since I have a computer I can send a quick e-mail saying hi, or asking how they're doing. Also imagine going to work and not having a computer! Thats a lot of work to write down! At some works, the work consists of emailing other work members about the problems they are having, and about meetings. By using a computer you can keep up to date on everything thats going on. Also computers are helpful because if you had a test to study for, and you forgot your notes at school, you can look up online what you are studying. Then you can study from the computer. So then the next day you won't fail the science test. Computers can be a nice little break after all your homework is done. If you want to go on the computer to talk to your friends, it should be an insentive to get all your homework done first. Sometimes people need some down time after all their homework is over with.

You know now when you have that project due for science class about protoplasms. You want to do as you can so you have that at. When you realize that the one book you find on it wont help you with the score you want you realize that the nextplace to look is the computer.

You will find all this in the computer. When you see a sale on a ""five nights and four days"" trip to @ORGANIZATION1, you want to know what better sale they have. When you start to notice that your family needs a vacation what is the only place to look. You can'@CAPS3 look for that trip of a lifetime in a book. Sure you can find out that @CAPS1 is having that big blowout sale, but you cant search up the best deal. I've done a research with seven of my friends and that six of those seven parents have deal on a trip to @ORGANIZATION1 on their accounts. If you're a great fan of road trips you'll find a deal or @CAPS2's for the lowest only find out by computer. If you live in @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4 and you want to have a trip to the @LOCATION1 this deal is really good. If you live in the @LOCATION2 and you know the hottest day in the @DATE1 is coming you will be ready to get those beach balls and that blanket ready, but if you think computers are a waste of time then you wont know that all the beaches open and will be sending free drinks all day. You will be at home eating a @CAPS3.V. watching old reruns of The @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Not only will it tell you news in your erea, but will tell you about that devastating earthquake in @LOCATION5. You'll also be informed about what people are doing to help them and what you can do to help. So not only is the computer good for going on @CAPS6 and @CAPS7, you can help get your grade to an A+ on that history report. It also works well for giving your children a memory they will always remember. They also help you to get ready and not be stock in your house on that nice day in @DATE1. Maybe if you find that great deal or help your kid get a better grade then you will realize how good the computer is.",5,5,1
258,"Dear Local Newspaper, Spending too much time on the computer is never a good thing. Whether you are doing work or things for pleasure. I strongly believe this because being on the computer too long will mean that you are spending less time excersising, interacting with real family and friends rather than on the internet, and being on computer too long can ruin your vision. Nowadays with all the great advances in technology, peoples are always glued to computer screens. Lets face it, once you go on the computer, it can get pretty addicting with all of the fabulous things you can do and when we get addicted, we don't feel like doing other things like excersising. Studies show that @PERCENT1 of the kids who use his or her computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day is obese. The cause of this problem is obvious and it is kids being addicted to computers. Since they are so addicted to computers, the do not want to go to the gym or anything. Another example is that in school kids have a choice of what electives the want to take. Many kids would rather choose the computer programming class rather than physical education. This also cuts down on their excersise time. Computers are wonderful things, but when it starts affecting your health and physical fitness, they are enemies. Interacting with others on the computer can be looked at as a positive but it is not since it affects the way you interact in real life. For instance, some people develop a habit from only interacting through the computer that makes them anti-social in real life. Furthermore, some kids can be the most pleasant people to interact with through the computer but then when you used them in real life, they are the quietest people in the world. This happens because they are more comfortable interacting through the computer. Also, they have lost their abilities to interact in real life. Interacting through the computer is great if you have family and friends in other countries but you shouldn't do it so much that you become uncomfortable to interact in real life. Your eyes are one of the most important parts of your body besides the vital parts. Most people do not know this but being on the computer too long puts strain on your eyes which is bad. This strain only lead to unpleasant things. For example, if you we addicted to computers, then there is a large chance you will get glasses someday in your life. A recent poll was taken and over @PERCENT2 of people who use their computers for more than @NUM2 hours a day have gotten glasses. Another example is that overtime the strain build up and up to the where even with glasses you can hardly see. Imagine a world where your vision is so bad that it is like your eyes are almost closed, that's what happens to people who use their computers too long. Local newspaper, you @MONTH1 think that computers are one of the greatest inventions ever, the you are right, however you shouldn't use it too much.",6,5,1
493,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1 I belive that computers benifit society because it is a faster and easyer way to do thing such as. Communication, email helps comunicat with other people when you don't have time to talk on the phone at work or don't want to spend an hour on the phone. It is also faster than wating for them to anwer the phone and ther phone mite die. Or they wont answer and they need information fast. Another good thing about computers are looking up information like if you are going an atrip you can look up hotels find maps and plane tikets and see what the place will look like, or if you have a school project that you need to finish but you don't have time to read you go on the internet. If you have to look up a contry or a peresident or an animal or find picturs the internet has it all. Even bilding progects like plastering a wall bying a window or planting bilding a shed you can find direction and supplies you will need and the interent. Computer can even help someone at work like an arctech the can use computers to make a @NUM1 sketch of a bilding. Even for storing data like at the doctors ofice they keep you @CAPS1 in a computer. Or the goverment keeps secet @CAPS1 in computers. There ars still job like fixing computers bilding computers. This is why. I think computers are good for society becose without computers without computers same people want have a job and everything will be harder and be limited to sertan things like fast communication and work directions.",4,4,0
970,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, @DATE1's society is much more different from what it was like twenty years ago. We have phones that can easily allow us to browse the web as we please just like a computer. Our access to such a large network beings us together, can broaden mental horisons and keep many @CAPS5 hard workers on key point so that when time for work comes around, they are ready. Not everyone agrees that technology is benefit to our growing well, but I believe it keeps us moving forward and away from ignorance in all of its forms. Our construction workers work hard during their busy seasons. They vigorously build sley scraping towers, educational fucilities, additions to our health center, and even the very places we call home. However, when weather is not on their side and building anything can be hazzardous in the long run, they must still ramain at the ready when duty calls. Lately, there has been an advancement in technology to help chane opperators maintain their skills during their of season vistually. It @MONTH1 appear easy to the untrained spectation. To one it @MONTH1 seem like all they do is seat themselves in a pull a few levers, and push a few buttons. However, there is in fact a persition to such a task. Pull the lever to quickly and the crane can go sharply in the wrong direction causing it to tip over. One of feild reponters tried the @CAPS1 virtual trainer and found a @CAPS1 appreciation for the jobs at our builders. That just goes to show that @CAPS5 one does not keep such skill in check, they could in fact cause a serious malfunction on a construction site. I, personally, find it very entertaining and at the same time educational to learn a language different from my own. In fact, I teach myself @CAPS4 at home. However, @CAPS5 I did not have a computer at home, my studies would be near impossible. With @DATE1's economy going to a class outside & school, or even hiring a personal tutor, can be enough to effect anyones budget emensly. The internet provides an efficient low casting, or even free, way to help any language learner. One can even find study tips from native speakers at those who have already learned vast bit about the language. In @DATE1's society not everyone has the time to go to he library and pick up a book on a country they are interested in. Some @MONTH1 say that asking a neighbor about their home canbe just as afective, but that can awkward for those that don't particulary do well in face to face setting. However, havbing a complete at hand can make learning an enjoyabl experience. Once can find blog posts about someone's visti to there country of interest & even videos of their time there. Websites made entirely for those interesting a particular culture can also prove helpful. On the other hand, @CAPS5 someone were to be looking for and acception vacation spot recommended by locals, that information can be found as well. Some people do not love in an area where they can connect with family by a simple call or a drive. One @MONTH1 have to take a plane or pay to take with relatives. Social networks on the web makes connecting with lvoe ones easier and more affordable. The speed of instant messaging can make it seem like they are in the same room instead across the ocean. I hope that everything I have fare travel can serve a purpose to someone who has not been able to find way benefits to technological advances. Please do remember that technology can serve as a skill maintenance tool, educational, and as a connection for our foreign born citizens. Thank you for",5,6,1
1321,"Dear newspaper readers, @CAPS1 this! Sitting at home on the couch eating a bag of potato chips. The @CAPS2 shows a beautiful picture of the @LOCATION1 you can almost feel the rain falling on you, you really want to learn more about it. All of a sudden you watch the remote fall to the ground you hand eye coordination is so bad you totally miss it when you try to grab it. On top of that, you remember you were supposed to meet your sister today who you seen for years but you canÂ’t! if you had a computer you would be to learn about more places and people, it would improve your hand eye coordination, and you could interact with people without having time to meet them! Computers definitely have good effects on people! First, computers help to improve hand-eye coordination. It is a fact that people who own one or more computers in a household have better hand-eye coordination than people without computers! DonÂ’t you want good hand-eye coordination too? As a matter of fact, my friend @PERSON4 had the worst hand-eye coordination in our school, now that her parents have bought her a computer, she is a lot quicker and definitely has better hand-eye coordination. She said that just looking at the screen and she wanted to go helped a lot. Also, computer time can states that computers have been proven to improve hand-eye coordination in the course of a year. that sounds pretty simple to me! Next, computers also  allow people to learn about other faraway places and people. Local middle school teacher, @PERSON2, uses computers to teach her students about the @CAPS3 culture and geography. That sounds a lot more interesting than just talking! My cousins saw an article about @LOCATION3 once and they thought it was amazing they learned a lot about the culture there and actually took a trip there! Furthermore, vacations.com says that computers are the #@NUM1 cause of people traveling, because they see pictures and articles about places. You can learn about any place you want on a computer, doesnÂ’t that sound nice? IÂ’m sure there is one place youÂ’ve always wanted to learn about! Finally, computer allow people to interact with other people around the world You can talk with your long lost friend who lives in @LOCATION2 just by the click to the mouse,(send). In a recent study, over @PERCENT1 of people just talk online to their friends rather than going out to meet them. How convenient! Also, expert computer teacher, @PERSON1, says, Â“Computers are geat inf you can't meet someone, you just talk onlineÂ”. Have you ever needed to cancel a meeting? Computer are really beneficial to busy people. Now readers, @CAPS1, your sitting on that same couch you look at the @CAPS2 to see @LOCATION1, you quickly type it into your laptop and an article right in front of you read more about it learning something new in every paragraph. All of a sudden you lose your grip, but you catch your laptop just in time, what hand-eye coordination! Then you remember you were supposed to meet you sister @PERSON3, but you have a hair appointment. You quickly tell her via computer you cant meet her. She says itÂ’s alright and you guys keep chatting it all worked out! ItÂ’s so simple! Computers teach hand-eye coordination, let you learn about more places, and interact with more people. So what are you doing readers? Get out there and get a computer.",5,4,1
1623,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 people these days rely too much on technology. Everywhere you go you usually see somebody on a phone, texting, on a computer or plugged into an ipod. These people are not necisarily bad, but they are under the control of technology. Computers for example, are in the eyes of most people, fast, easy and fun, but they also pose as a problem. Even though it seems like everybody has a computer, not everybody does. Also people become way to dependent on such matchines that they can become addicted to them. Computers @MONTH1 also seem like they work @PERCENT1 of the time, but they can also be very unrelyable. Just off the top of your head, how @CAPS3 people do you know that use @CAPS4 or @CAPS5? A lot I'm sure. Now multiply that number by itself for all the people they know and multiply it again and so forth. That number shows that, @CAPS6, over @NUM1 million people use these. Now what are the chances that if you sent a friend a message one of these programs (with the @NUM1 million + people on is) that the server will be @PERCENT1 relaible and your pal recieves the information he needs? My point is that, what if somthing important came up that required your friends help, and you could not reach him because of a fault in the system? What would happen You could be at a hospital for a ride home for an hour longer than it should have taken. Another problem is what if you needed a computer, and you specially needed him/her? If they did have one then You have you did it in @NUM3 minutes but how else could you contact them? You could try to call, but what if they are outside and are playing with his/her dog? Also these days if you are really grateful for somthing you go on google and type in virtual thank you cards. If the person gets it then they will be happy, but probly much more so if in the mail they got a handmade real thank you card. My final reason that computers hurt us more than they help is addiction. Like I said in my first paragraph, everywhere you go you see somebody wired into an electronic device. People no longer go outside and play cowboys and @CAPS7 because now all they have to do is hit paly. I will admit I too use my computer quite a bit but at least I budget my time so I can also go outside and play a while. Obeisity also branches from overuse of electronics along with @CAPS3 other products.",4,5,0

242,"Dear Newspaper, In our town, more people are on the computer each day. Some people state that you can do a lot on the computer and talk to people. But, I believe that our town should not support advances in technology. You will have more time to exercise, talk to family and friends in person and to take part in different activities around the town. Do you want to be overweight and not be in shape? Well, if you sit at the computer all day every day, you will become like that. ""I think exercise shoud be a part of everybody's day,"" @CAPS1 teacher @PERSON1 from @LOCATION1 stated. You would be so attatched to your computer, that you wouldn't work out. In the state of @LOCATION1, it is proven that @PERCENT1 of residents are overweight from not exercising and @PERCENT2 are overweight by not eating properly. This shows more people in @LOCATION1 don't exercise than not eating properly. @CAPS4 wants to be overweight and you can change that! More people each year make facebook and @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Some kids in school are on the internet all day talking to friends who live down the street. Students refuse to talk to their friend on the phone. Instead, they do it online. ""@CAPS4 can understand their tone of the message sent,"" @PERSON3 stated. You could interpret it in different ways. When you are on the phone, it is a quick and easy way to communicate not waiting for somebody to type back. If you are a person who is always on the computer, plan a get together with your friend to talk in real life. Sidewalk sales, clubs, sports teams, holiday stroll, these are events that every town offers! Instead of sitting dreaming of being on the team, go out and do it! Each town cares about its residents and want them to have fun. That is why towns offer these activities. ""@CAPS5 want to make the town interasting and everybody to know each other,"" says @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @PERSON2. If you participate in these activities, you will meet other kids your age around the town.

342,"Dear editor: More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that that benefits society. As editor of the newspaper, you have the power to inform people about situations. In my opinion computers are desperately in need because of the following: the computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, they allow people to talk online with others, and many jobs use computers. Do you want a more economically advanced state? First of all the computer gives people the ability to learn about far away places, people, and the weather. I have an uncle named @PERSON1, that has @NUM1 little girls. Every day in the morning before school @PERSON1 checks on the weather, on his computer to make sure it is safe to go school. However, one day forgot to check the weather on his computer and took his kids to school. Little did he know the roads were extremely icey. Sadly @PERSON1 and his daughters got in a car accident and two of girls broke a few bones. As you can see, the weather the computer world have saved him a trip to the emergency room. Next, the computer allows you to talk online with other people. Dr. @DR1 from @CAPS1 states says that, ""chating online with others (@CAPS2) is the best way to stay in touch with others from your old school, camp and many other places."" I highly agree because adults can stay in touch with freinds from middle school. Also @PERCENT1 of students say that they usually go online to study or get the pages for homework. I believe that chating online to study for tests is a fantastic idea because it will help the students to get better grades. Some parents say that that is a way to study and a waste of time. However teachers say that ever since @CAPS2 was invented the students grades were skyrocketing. Finally most jobs today use computers. For example my dad works for @ORGANIZATION1 and the computer helps him communicate with clients all over the world. Also the chat can translate the language, thus it makes it much easier than talking on the phone. Also the teachers use computers to put grades from students in. This makes the teachers job much easier because it averages all of the grades. The computer revolutionise the jobs of people. In conclusion the computer has a positive effect on people because it gives people the ability to learn about faraway places, people, and weather, allows people to talk online with other people, and many jobs use computers. I urge you to support me by writing a positive article on computer and how the help the society. Please take my idea into consideration.",5,4,1

Like if they are meeting one at a place and they said they if just means they were on the computer all day long. My second reason is theie family. I said their family because they could miss out on a lot of things. Such as a family reunion, a family vacation and many more. It like if one of their family members hurt and they are trying to call you but you dont picking up the phone because you to busy on the computer to pick it up.

They can lose their job cause your missed work cause your on the computer for doing nothing work cause computer. If they lose their jobs they can pay for they can't use their computer. They are going to be in their house with no light and no computer cause they have on it to much and did not pay attention was happening.

If you have a computer, I'm sure you can agree with me that there are tons of good things you can do. For example, I know of many online colleges. Ever heard of the commecial, ""@CAPS1 in your @CAPS2's?"" that is where students can got their @CAPS3.E.D and have a succesful carreer. Not only that, you can get discounts on many items just by shopping online. There are many shopping sites online, such as @ORGANIZATION1.

735,"As you can see, technology these days is always getting more and more advanced. It seems as if there is a new invention that atracts many people to buy all the time. One electronic that has been useful in so many ways to people are the computers. Many think to much time is spent on this, but then I think about how much it's benefiting. Computers can tell you pretty much anything you need to know, @CAPS1 it's about same country, or how to solve a problem. @CAPS2, computers are so advanced were you can talk to friends who are faraway. Lastly computers is helping us giving very specific directions, rather than figuring out a map. Say you're doing a school project about a country. By typing in exactly what you need to know you can find your information in a heartbeat. @CAPS1 it's population, density, languages, foods or holidays, computers are the easiest and most simple way to get this information. Or maybe you just want to know about this country because it interested you. Maybe even you plan on visiting this country, you're going to want to know about the place you'll be spending your time. If you do plan on traveling to somewhere you've been researching, you can order your plane tickets right there online. You can figure out the routes you plan on taking, and this can help oprganize your trip. Another reason computers are benefiting so many people, is the feature of communicating with others, @CAPS1 it's taking to a faraway friend or family, or you're bestfriend a couple streets over; you probably still want to keep in touch with them. Computers are so advanced now, that they have webcams; were you can visually see the person your contacting right into the computer. This is a more exciting way to talk to someone, especially if it's someone you don't see often that @MONTH1 even live in another country, @CAPS2, most teenagers like to keep in touch pretty much every day. Usually kids like chatting on instant message just for the pleasure of talking to your friends. Finally, computers are benefiting us with knowing directions and routes. Like mentioned before, computers can give straight foward directions. This is esier to handle rather than useing a map while on the road. There are websites were all you have to do is type in your exact loocation and your exact destination and it will tell you specific roads and turns you need to take. In conclusion, those for who are worried about the ones who should be exercising, being outside, enjoying nature, should learn to expand there time doing so, and shortening time online, and learn to be on the computer, only when necessary.",5,4,1
1049,"Dear edditer of my local newspaper In my opinion computers have a positive effect on people. I support the advances in technology. I believe @CAPS1 is a positive thing because @CAPS1 teaches hand-eye coordination, gives people the ability to learn about far away places and people, and even allows us to talk online with others. In the following poragraphs I will share with you my opinions and why they are the right opinions for all to believe in. Firstly hand-eye coordination plays a big part in our lives, many of us do sports. Now sports isn't just about being the best @CAPS1's about getting better and doing your best. Sports take alot of practice, and are way is computer games though I bet you didn't know @CAPS1, these games help you develope hand-eye coordination. Defeating these monsters and such really helps you in sports. Catching and throwing is a big part in alot of sports and thats all hand-eye coordination, and where do you think you get @CAPS1 from practice and computer games. So next time your on the computer play som games and that will be like practicing for sports and will help you devolop the hand-eye coordination you need to suceed in a sport. Secondly, @CAPS2 in favor for computer use is because @CAPS1 gives us the oppurtunity to learn about places and people from all around the world. Think about @CAPS1 before computers if you want to know something you might have to locate all around for a book that tells you @CAPS1, @CAPS1 could take, now you type what you want to know or google and bing theres your answer. This ability to quickly find what your looking for allows you more freedom to learn and spend other precious time doing other things you want to do then take the to locate and read the right book. As you can see this is a ability and can be a big help when you need to know something fast. So help you yourself and use computers make life easyer. Thirdly computers are a way to communicate they can let you talk to people all around the, when you might and usaly be able do. This is a great way to stay in contact wen people move, go away on a buisness trip go on vacation, or even to meet new people. Say you cany get a hold of someone because there phone is off and its important you talk to them you could email them or if there online and ahave @CAPS3.M. you could @CAPS2(instant message) them. This would save you the hessle of having to keep calling him. Also if you want to see what there doing or where they are you could us a webcome and see them instead of just talking to them. As this paragraph shows internet and computers open more then ever before. As the I wrote above, I showed not even a fraction of what computers are good for. My reasons for computers being more of positive thing, ever a negitive thing are as followed; they help us with learning things that before we couldn't, communicate with others, and help us develope hand eye coordination. I can only hope that as I write my conclusion, ""that my opinions were heard and that this letter has helped all see why computers are a great thing, not a bad one.",5,5,1
382,"Dear Local Newspaper, @ORGANIZATION1's benefit society imensely. They help us learn about far away places, they help us with our school work and the let us communicate with other people online. We need computers. Computers allow us to learn about other countries, people, @CAPS1 etc... How would we learn about places we might want to go on vacation? Or how would we learn about the places we want to see, and the places we want to stay away from? We need computers to do this. We would never even know of some countries if it werent for computers. Next computers help us with our school work. Sometimes we get project spend most of them involve research! Computers make this a whole lot easier on us. Also instead of lugging your text books from school to home and back, we can use online textbooks. Why give us extra work, it's a waste of everyones time. Instead of wasting your minutes talking on a phone, you can chat online. Wasting minutes is wasting money. Who wants to do that? Besides using the keyboard to chat with friends will help you in the future. @NUM1 out of @NUM2 studens, say they prefer to talk online then to call someone. Computers benefit us by easy aces to info. Computers are a lot easier to help us with school work, than textbooks are. Lastly computers let us talk to other people online. Without computers everything would be so much harder.",3,4,0
1014,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever thought about people's veiws on certain technolgy? While some people say that others spend too much time on their computers, and are waisting their time, I think computers can help us with many different things. They can help with homework, interacting with people, and even help us with exercising. You'll find that in the end, computers end up as benefits for everyone. For many students, they need computers to help them understand their subjects. There are certain websights that give online lessons. Along with that, they have online books, so if they forget their real ones, they can still do their homework. My math teacher, @PERSON2, is always saying,""@CAPS1 into the online sight."" I've found that it really helps me when I'm struggling with my work. We can also ask our friends with help if we still @CAPS4't understand. That's not all we can do. There are certain sights like @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 where we can interact with other people. You can talk to them when they're out of town and have no cell-phone. You can also tak when the phone is being used and you have something importain to tell them, such as helping them with their homework. When there's no telephone reception between each other, they can still talk over one million people in the @LOCATION1 use these sights. People are wrong when they say it takes their time away from exercising. Many websights give good tips on how to lose weight. The show many dieting plans such as @PERSON3 or @PERSON1. Not only that, but they also have exercise plans. It's not the computer's fault, it's the people who @CAPS4't ""stick"" with exercising. Also, the computer reccomends many great gyms you can join, like @LOCATION2 fitness. @CAPS4't you think that's a good ""deal?"" @CAPS4't listen to those other people stick with my opinion that computers are benefits for everyone. They can help us with many things, above and beyond. I can't imagine life without them. Most everyone uses computers! Thank you for reading.",4,4,0
1034,"I support advances in technology because In the future. Our world will be run by computers people can learn about places and people that they can never afford to see for real, and lastly, this helps to connect people to other people without talking to them directly. Have you ever thoughtabout the future, I know I have, usually when you think future, you think nobody and lots of automated things. The fact is the world is turning into a pure run by technology and as we the people get smarter, so does the technology so what good will the future if none of us know how to work a simple peice of technology such as a computer, then how are we going to use the more complicated things then? Believe it or not our world within @NUM1 years will be run all on computers, you will not have to do antyihg but wil them. without computers, how would we know aobut all of the stuff that we know now. How would people know that egypt looked like @NUM2 year ago? they dont to be there they could just look it up on the computer and how just as must about it as if they went there. Also computers enable you to learn about people that lived before your time. What president that you in something aobut how would you be able to find out after computer you could go to a library is right there to be will out computers in todya society. Our average being would in at how does becaus of the that computers have given us. I can whey some experts are conceried that are however, for some people this is the only correction to their emily and friends it there is a family that lives lets say in a different country, and he or she wanted to talk to you, how would you go about doing that? I know that I would try to contact them on the computer. I love friends that live out of state and I enjoy talking to them so if we did not have the compuers that we do. these experts are sasying that we are going to drive across the country to talk to them, if you ask me htat is pretty tire consuming and pointless. In conclusion, I hope that you agree with me in keeping technology in our lives is important because of the future for people to learn nee things about places and people, and also to communicate with friends and family although I can se your part of view that kids are not getting enough exercise most kids that computers are also involved sport.",4,4,0
973,"I am writing this article to inform you on how most people are spending their time an computers. In this article I am going to tell you about computers and what people are doing with them these days. Some people use their computers for business of work related. But then again these are people that use them for entertainment and other social things. These are the people that just sit on the computer all day. What they could be doing is enjoying life. Going outside and getting fresh air. But no they want to sit inside all day long on the computer. Now is why do people want to stay inside all day long on the computer some people are constantly on their social websites. Such as @CAPS1 or @CAPS2. They are obsessed so thoes are teo websites that are very addicting to some people. and then these are the people who just like looking things up. Then lastly just get off, go spend time with your family the computer will always be there. And use the computer only when you need to. Yeah its fun to go look up things for your entertainment. But all things are good in moderation. So I hope you will listen and also agree with me I think I made my point about how much you should use computers. So thank you for listening.",3,3,0
550,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are harmfully effecting the children, and they are going to effect @CAPS1 generations even more. Computers are fine in moderation, as are most things. If they are needed for a school project that fine but using the computer everyday rather than exercising is not okay. Supporters of technology say that computers have a positive effect. I have to disagree. They say they practice hand eye coordination, they can teach you about far away places and you can talk with people online. Sports are a great way to exercise and practice hand eye coordination. Tennis, baseball, basketball, hockey, etc are all great sports that practice hand eye coordination. They are much healthier that I.Ming your friends all day. You sit on your butt all day and scream to your mom to get you a drink of water, or some dinner. ""@CAPS1 generations are becoming way to dependant."" says @PERSON1, my @NUM1 grade @CAPS2 teacher. How are you suppose to be able to support a family when your older if you cant get up from the computer. ""@CAPS3 a family is hard work,"" my mom tells me, ""your family needs food which means someone needs a job, and someone also needs to get the food. That takes a lot of time and energy."" I agree with my mom, and if simple things like going outside for an hour a day are practiced as a child, having a job and @CAPS3 a family will be easier. Rather than searching the internet for hous to find a good online source to support your thesis paper go to the library! The internet is a realitively new data basis. However, it has grown so much. You cannot always trust internet sources. People who @MONTH1 have posted the website could very well be crazy. Plus websites are filled with viruses, and what happens when your computer is dead due to viruses and you actually need your computer for a school project? The simple alternative would be going to the local library and checking out a variety of books. The books are trusted and filled with information. The internet is also not a very safe place. Facebook, aim, email, twitter, etc are all ways for people to comunicate through the computer. Facebook, aim and twitter are scary and not safe because you @MONTH1 not know who you are talking to. They do have a profile which you @MONTH1 be able to relate to, but they could be lying. ""The internet is a broad place open to strangers,"" my dad says. I am not allowed to have these ways to comunicate because of the specific reasons that I stated earlier. My parents are doing this to protect me and I agree with their decision. Rather than talking to complete strangers go over to your friends house. Your friends are the people that you want to talk to and spend time with. Overall computers are bizarre pieces of technology that can be unsafe, not truthful, and are forcing children to become more dependent on adults. I have to disagree with the supporters of technology. There are many healthy alternatives to the computer. I believe that experts who are concerned that people are spending to much time on the computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. Not only do the alternatives that I stated before keep people safe, they also practice a healthier way of living. It is important to keep your bodies healthy because in the end thats what everyone's goal should be.",6,4,1
1353,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 our nain forest growing back, service that takes only a few second, and being able to find practically any answer to any question. What could cause this phenominon. The answer is computers. These electronic wonder help us and our planet in some many ways. because they are ecofriendly, efficient, and loaded with information. You @MONTH1 be asking yourself how computers are ecofriendly. Well, for starters they help slow the waste of paper. Did you know that the @LOCATION1 kills aproximately @NUM1 million trees a year for book. Computers help prevent this in several way. For example instead of sending a short letter to the police cheif asking about what the new driving law is. You could send an email and save the paper. Also if you wanted the newspaper staff to interview the people that survived the power plant explotion you could send them all an e-mail with instructions to the surviers house insted of giving out maps individually. So now you see how ecofriendly computers are. My next reason was the eficentcy. My dell laptop @CAPS2 home takes about @NUM1 min to iload, @NUM3 sec to get on the internet, and @NUM4 sec to get to another webpage. So say that I want to know how many legs a centiped has (parents don't know either) without a computer it would take @NUM5 min to get to the library, @NUM6 min to find a parking spot, and @NUM4 min to find a book about cenipeeds. In total thats a least @NUM8 mins but my computer would only take @NUM1 min @NUM10 sec about. Also if you wanted to ask a friend what she is doing on @DATE1. I would only take a few seconds to send an email and she would answer quickly back, because she most likely on the computer a. My third reason was because computer are loaded with information, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 library I might find @NUM4 book on a sudject but on a computer I @MONTH1 find thousand. Once I was doing a report on monarch butterflys. @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 library I found @NUM12 books about them, On the internet I found @NUM13 wedsites on them! Also books have general information like just @CAPS5 life, but the internet has specific information the @CAPS5 part in the enviorment.

From my data that I have collected, computers are both somewhat good, and bad. But I believe that there are more reasonable ""@CAPS1,"" toward computer use. In my opinion, I state that computers are quite addicting due to, addiction of computer, loss time of exercise, and how computers @MONTH1 ""help,"" one in obtaining the loss of their social enviorment. Computer @MONTH1 seem helpful but of @ORGANIZATION1 they are a great way to research for @ORGANIZATION1 reasons. But there is also the choice of books for research. Computer use has risen to a substancial crisis line, because they are addicting. An example is the well-known link called, ""@CAPS2,"" @CAPS2 is a place where you can socialize. But when your child has a @CAPS2, and they are on the computer doing ""homework,"" there is a @PERCENT1 that they will end upon @CAPS2, than rather doing their homework that important information was found at an @ORGANIZATION1 @DATE1. Computers are addicting also because of online computer games. Computer games online can be fun, but are a complete waste of time for you electrical bill, and @ORGANIZATION1 purposed of you child. Computers are very addicting in terms of @CAPS2, and online games. Computers are somewhat good, but are very to you health. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of @LOCATION1 has increased their weight, due to videogames and computer? Computers are horrible when it comes to this topic. Overtime, you begin to gain weight by spending more time using the computer and less time working out and staying fit. This also revolves around addiction, by using the computer over a large period of time. In the end, computers are a harzardous topic, when it comes to working out, and staying in shape. Computers are terrible and horrified when it comes to friends. Friends are people who spend time with you and interact with you. But computers see it a different way. by using computer for a long period of time, you begin to think how computers are all you need. Soon enough, your friends will leave you because you don't care about them, and forget them. This also revolves around addiction. By addiction, you lose your friends and you damage your social enviornment. Computer @MONTH1 seem ""fun,"" but are defuliated when it comes to friends. In the end, I beleive that computers are a waste, because they are addicting you become very unhealthy and they strive to damage your social enviornment. With the facts I have stated, they have supported my reasons. Computers are not the way to go. So, try books.",5,4,1

You can keep touch with them through @CAPS1 or e-mail. Its a quicker and new way to meet new people. My second reason is you can learn about new places. You can learn new places by just clicking on an webpage. Computers are a faster way to learn. I gives you everything you need to know about the ne places you want to learn about.

Computers are not good for people these day's because people are spleeling all there time' on the computer and are'nt realling that it miss up there eye's and some people are adicted to it. Now people are useing the computer like they are nutting. So people think that the computers aren't hurtful to there eye's the time people are speeling on the computer they can be speeling time with there family and friend. People helpful is on the line with this computer thing. People shouldn't be useing computers like they are because all day on the computer can mess up your eyes and that's what people are not understand there day.

798,"I walked into my living room one night and saw my mom on the computer. I thought to myself ""she is always on that computer, doesn't she work to do?"". I said to my mom ""I think we should have an hour two of the computer each night, or not have one at all."" I told her that I think computers are a bad choice because you don't know who is on the internet and is trying to talk to you. Also, it gets in the way of exercising and spending time with family and friends. The internet/computers are very dangerous now a days. You never know if someone is a friend or a predator trying to get you. Say if you were talking to someone and you thought it was your friend, well you don't know for sure if it is then or not. I could be an older man or women trying to get a hold of you so they can probably kidnap you. Steal from you and worse. Now I watch the news and see many kidnapping because kids are talking to people on the internet and don't know who they are or what they look like. Like, when a girl was talking to a man and she thought it was her friend, turns out it wasn't and she got in a whole lot trouble. Maybe if she met him she would have gotten very hurt and be scared of that memory for the rest of her life. Family is very important to most families now a days. I have heard that spending time with family would bring your grades up in school because as you talk to them, you learn new things. Sadly this is not happening because people are so isolated to their computers they don't spend one minute with family or friends. I have a friend who is always on the computer. She never spends time with her family or friends. She is so focused on the computer screen then what is going on around her. Recently she has been getting off the computer and making more time with family and friends. Even her grades started going up because she spending more time studying with her mom and dad, then being on.... for example @CAPS1 or myspace and not getting any work done for school. In other words, she is very happy in life now and has changed from this experience she has gone through. Most people think you can use your brain for knowledge and call it exercise. That is one way to put it but it is not exercise for your body. People have spent more time having their eyes glue to the computer screen that they don't go out and play or maybe go a gym. The rate of obecity in our country is increasing for many reasons and lack of exercise is one of them because people spend to much time watching tv and being on the computer. I have a little cousin who is over weight and should be out playing sports and exercising. But does she, ""no""... She spends her free time on the computer in a stuffy room, instead of getting fresh air from outside. She keeps asking me how did I get and what age, and I keep telling her, I exercise and play sports so I can't tell you when. I keep saying that to her but she never listens. To this day she is still the same because she didn't take my advice to get off the computer and go outside to play. I strongly agree that we should have only two hours of the computer each night or have no computers at all. For kids saftey from bad people out there in the world, spending time with family and friends and finally for exercise and to stay fit with our bodies. I hope people understand what I say and take action to persue them in they own life and convice others too.",5,4,1
892,"Dear Newspaper, I often think about the effect of technology on humans. The human race has discovered many things but our biggest advance is technology. New machines are robots are built all the time, and our knowledge of machines and artificial minds is rapidly growing. The most widely used machine is the computer. People use it for all sorts of things, communucation, awareness and learning and entertainment. Some experts are concerned that people spend too much time on computers and it couldn't agree more. Computers maybe useful but they are over used. People spend more time staring at the screen than exercising and interacting with friends and family. Computers are also not always dependable or safe. First of all, the biggest computer users are adolesents. Young adults spend hours on websites like @CAPS1, @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 communicating with their friends. At their young age, exercise is very important. Obesity in children from lack of exercise is becoming very common, and its because young people are glued to their computer screens. The averange child need @NUM1 minutes of exercise a day, and many have very little none. I say the computers are ok, but only in small doses. The growing mind and body needs to move and exercise. If internet use among children and teenagers is not cut back, some worry that there will be a lot more health problems in the future. Although it is very east to quickly communicat through the internet, it can sometimes do more harm than good. Kids who spend hours @CAPS4 or emailing their peers spend less time with their families. I've heard parents say they barely see their kids because their always either doing homework. Also, @CAPS5 to @CAPS5 conversations are fading. Because of the internet, people no longer need to get together and talk, @CAPS6 turn on their computers, which is a waste of energy. Why not just go see your friend @CAPS6 of typing all day? Lastly, computers have just as many disadvantages as they do advantages. There are plenty of dangers out there in @LOCATION1. Online predators lurk as many comers, and your personal information and identity can easily be stolen. The risk of any of these things happening is very high. Its better safe than sorry. So, if you think about it, we really don't need computers to survive. You need your exercise, don't blow it off for online chat. Also, its very important to interact and be part of your family, and less internet use will cut down the risk of identity theft, or any other problem or virus. It's your time now.

Without the computer, families who live far away from each other can talk with a push of a button. @CAPS5 lets us talk to our friends after school and plan what we are going to do that night. Long distance calls cost money and it is not worth @MONEY1 a call if you call every couple of days. Communication has evolved so much in the past @NUM1 years. Computers are just the bigginning.

Computers help us expand our learning capabilities and give us a chance to learn things that normally we wouldn't. That is another reason why computers are very benefitial to the society.

Work data and they help @PERCENT1 of businesses we file reports communicate with other branches of that company.

If you on the computer you could get a computer that say's a free labtop then you could take it far like: On a airplane to north carolina, or virginia, or wasington @ORGANIZATION1, or a party, or a road trip, or on a ferry boat to the long island sound.

Sports also build hand and eye coordination just like if your sitting on the couch using a computer.

That's why we should cherries every last moment we have with them. A complete citizens and drives them from family and friends. Computers can take away your social life and you never do go out and meet people and friends. To sum things up computers are a to citizens and cause them to drive out family and friends. Nature is exotic and beautiful and all of us should take care of it and appreciate what we have. Computers can become harmful to nature and destroy homes for animals, for example when you print something from your computer it prints if out on paper. This causes more trees to be knocked down and cut for paper. We should only use paper for emergency's and not splurge on it. We all want the world to be a better place so stop destroying it for our own benefits! In conclusion computers just in the and will cause chaos and destruction.

People should go green and start recyling and not worrying about what somebody said on ""myspace"" or ""facebook"". Also if we started recyling and worring about nature @PERCENT3 of the earth would be greener. My last reson being their should be more friendler family time enstead of computer time.

""They ignore the biggest fact that computers are only used to make life easier."" This is really what computers are made to do, help us. It could be as simple as a @CAPS1 (@ORGANIZATION1) or as complexed as a super computer but it still only serves the main purpose of making life easier. Even if you tried to upgrade a computer it would still serve the same purpose, yet people still look on it as if it were still the next big thing in entertainment. Many people might not even know it yet but computer can turn on you and really ruin your life. Ever since @PERSON1 made @ORGANIZATION2 the @CAPS2 popular disk @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 around, people have been using computers alot. Its not because he created the fastest computer ever. It is because @ORGANIZATION2 is selling world wide; for buisnesses, small companies, schools, even in entertainment. A few years ago they made something called the xbox @NUM1. It revolutionized both gaming and the way people look at gaming. But whats the problem here? The problem is that because of @ORGANIZATION2 people are now more addicted to entertainment. When this happens people will start becoming dependent on a computer. Its not that @ORGANIZATION2 did anything bad but the fact that since @CAPS2 computers have internet, those people who depend on computers are going to find it hard to avoid being hacked or worse getting all their information stolen. There is this one thing about computers that remains constant. Family and friends will find it hard to talk to there loved one when they spend all there time on computers. This makes comunication hard, and like I said before its very addicting. ""@CAPS2 of the people who don't have real friends will chat with people online not knowing who they really are."" says @CAPS3 @PERSON3. Making friends online is the @CAPS2 unsafe thing to do on a computer. Over @PERCENT1 of the people online are not who they say they are and people will often break away from thier real friends just to find this new ""friend"" they've made. So remember, even though computers are",5,5,1
1738,"Dear readers, People around the world are starting to use computers now more, often, but theirs also people that dont agree that it benefits society, @CAPS1 not one of those people. I agree that this benefits society. One reason why I agree is because sometimes theirs teens and even adults that can chat online with their friends if they cant contact them in any other way. Another reason is because in all school teacher give their students project to do over vacation or weekends, for the projects they can look for information in the computer. The last reason is because computers can give ability to learn more about things they didnt know before. In my opinion I agree with computers benefiting society. Teens, kids and even adults would like to talk with their friends so they can get on the computer and chat with them if theirs no other way to contact them, @CAPS2 easy. You only have to @NUM1) get in the computer, @NUM2) get into a site were you know your friend might be @NUM3) log in or register in if you never been into that site @NUM4) last but not least look @NUM4 your friend to chat will teachers always give their students work for example like projects. Kids also do projects on weekends or vacation and so you dont have to go to a library to check out a book you could always get on the computer and look for the information you need their. Computers give you abilitys to learn information you didnt know before for example if your bored and you dont got nothing to do get in the computer and look up information about things like nature, books your looking for etc. I agree with computers benefiting society but not everyone, @NUM3 reason why I agree is kids can chat online with their friends, look up information for projects and find information they never knew about, what do you think @CAPS1 I right or wrong.",4,3,0
1268,"People use computers everyday. There's so many reasons way the're always on. They could be talking to one of their family relatives. Also they're probally looking for jobs. There's many things and people shouldn't tell them what to do with their lives. Many people in @LOCATION1 use the computer to talk to one of their old friends and catch up on things. Also they could be talking to one of their family relatives. There's a thing called webcam and people in @LOCATION1 use it so they could see one another. Buisnesses people are always on the computer because they need to print out documents and they probally got to send something to another country. Buisnesses people also do lots of work on the computer. They can still exercise in @TIME1 for a quick jog, but also thats their choice if they want to stay health or not, plus they're busy people. Other hand people who go on the computer and who are not buisness people or they're not talking to family member or an old friend are students and parents. Tons of students in @LOCATION1 have projects everyday and they got to be on the computer to look up their information. Parents on the other hand also help out their children and they also talk to their relatives or these looking for a new home or job. If all those people are busy let them do their work they want for need to do. Once their done they could excerise but if they don't want to and other people told them to go not take a walk or anything healthy then it's their lost. We can't some them too. They're just getting better everyday and it's not effecting us. its effecting them. If they want to be on the computer they're also getting bad eye-sight because of too much light.",4,4,0
329,"Dear town @CAPS1 paper, I would have to pick being for computers. There are a couple reasons why I'm for computers and they are being able to talk to friends online, being able to learn stuff, and you can also play video games. One reason that I would be for computers is so you can talk to freinds online. So if you have a facebook or myspace you can talk to your friends all day if you wanted to. What I mean is simply by typing in what you want to say to your friend they will receive those exacte words then they'll reply. For example if you wanted to just say hi then your friend would look at his/hers messages then just reply. So being able to talk to friends online is one example why I for computers. Another reason that I would be all for computers is being able to learn things. So if you wanted to learn a language then you would go to google or something and try to find a fast easy site. What I mean is if you goto google a whole bunch of site's will come up, so what you want to do is find the fastest easyest site for you. So being abe to learn important things like a language is another reason I'm for computers. The last reason for me picking computers is because you can play video games. What I mean is if you were borde and noone to talk to then you can get on your computer and play a mind numbing game or an educational game for class. For example in science class we played a game on the computer and it had to do with gravity and that was what we were learning about so it was an educatinola game. So that is the last reason why I'm for computers. I'm for computer because you can play games. So now you know why I'm all for computers. I am for computers because you can talk to friends online, learn stuff and play video games.",4,4,0
950,"Each year the world becomes more and more advance in technology. Technology helps and benefits us all in a good positive way. Computers are apart of this positive technology and definetely benefits society. Computers help us look up places and things we never seen before and teaches us about them, too. In addition, computers have a positive impact on families and benefits them greatly. Also, they help people from adults years out of college to teenagers in high school communicate with their friends. Therefore, computers help us all in some little way and makes life easier and more fun. To begin with computers helps us expand our knowledge. It us helps us look up facts or recent news quickly. For example, just recently the @DATE1 @CAPS1 occured and they usualy go late into the night so I didn't get to see the whole competition. I could just easily go look it up on the computer to see who won which medals. computers helped me by looking up the medals quick so I woudn't have to wonder who won a medals not. Computers help us expand our knowledge all the time. They help us look up facts for report, places we want to travel to, learn about the benefits of a certain pet and the posibilities can be endless. to continue with, computers help families by bringing them closer in a way. A family member could be watching a funny on youtube or @ORGANIZATION1 and could think its so funny that they want their whole family to see it you. In addition, stores sell clothes online now so mother and daugther can sit down together and shop without leaving the house. Computers bring my family together by we rent movies from @LOCATION1 on the computer. It brings us together when choose and pick which movie to rent. Also, it brings us together to have a family movie night. As a result, these things the computer gives brings out discussion in the family and gives a good topic that everyone can relate to and talk about. Another way computers are beneficial is they bring everyone together. There are many ways communicate on the computer these days. There is facebook, twitter, email, aim, and many more. They are all different, but they have one thing in common is to bring old friends and new friends together. For instance my mom just sign on to be in facebook so she can talk to all her old friends from highschool and she found one really good friends who she hasn't seen in ages it made her really happy. Therefore, it shows that computers aren't just for bringing new people together, old ones, too.",5,5,1
184,"Dear people that read the news paper and that have @CAPS1 that like to play the computer all day more. Than a hour. I think you should take your time and read my article in this wonderful newspaper. I am writing this article about @CAPS1 using the computer more than an hour. My first reason about this computers issue is it makes than not pay attention in the school. To support that reason so you dont think i am making this up is that they play the computer alot and it makes the @CAPS1 just think about the computer and not think about school. They play it so much and it can mess up the @CAPS1 and they can not focus in school. My second main reason is it makes them allways want to talk about the computer. So if they play it mare than a hour like i said it can cause them to be addicted like drug's it is just like that if you dont want your @CAPS1 to be addicted to drugs i hope you woudnt want your own @CAPS1 to be addicted to the computer. To continue about your @CAPS1 can allways @CAPS2 about the computer it can make your @CAPS1 sound like they have no life because they play it all day everday and I would hope you woudnt want your @CAPS1 to be like this. Most importantly my final reason why you shoudnt let your child play the computer for more than a hour a day. Because they can get over weight. Your @CAPS1 well only get up and go to the bathroom, and eat, they will only do stuff that is in the house. Your @CAPS1 will not go out side and play and they wont get no exerse at all. I hope you will understand where I am coming from I have a brother that is offering in the hospital right computer too much and it messed and the doctor said he make it not so I am praying that he well make it out alive so I hope you woudnt let you @CAPS1 do this it will mess up their life forever.

Computors also make life easier for many people. Computers @CAPS2 learning by let vast of information being available. I personaly find out about many world events just by bringing up yahoo.com. Computers alow me to learn about new @NUM1, learning about cultures all over the world can be done by computers. The last way computers @CAPS2 learning is by informing us about everyday thing like to get a stain out, how to pronounce a word, how to make a new dish, and much more. Computers are also crucial to communictaion. We use computers to talk to our freinds on facebook. You can also meet new people useing a pc. Everyone uses computer so you can basicly meet enyone. The last reason computers are important is for the commercial stand point computer help alot of small bussness out by letting than be known. Domestic seller and huge companies can compette for the same customer. Furthermore the internet generates alot money for people becausethey can use it as a cyber billboard. In conclusion the computer is usefull because of learning, communication, and comercial. Therefore the computer should be supported and not looked down upon.",4,4,0
297,"Dear local Newspaper, I assume you've heard about the ongoing debate about computers. I personally believe that computers do benefit society. I believe this because computers benefit by its online, internet, and overall help in other things. My first reason for why you should believe that they benefit society is that computers have online. By online in chat rooms, bank, etc. this helps because people talking to other people online can beast there their morale. it can boest morale in situations like with military officers, soldiers because they don't get to see their family but online can change that in on instant. Online also helps because you can pay bills to gave bank and it overall saves a trip to the bank & a waste of gas. So, online is my for why you, the local newspaper, should agree with me. My second reason is that the internat benifits a lot. The internet, a marvelous created @NUM1 years ago . Its great because you can buy things it, like on a websites such as ebay, amazon, etc. This helps because it also saves time. The internet is great also because with the internet, you can learn of foreign nations. Finally, the internet helps because you can receive news through it. This benefits society because people can instantly hear about natural disasters & problems occuring in the community, rather than hoping to find it in the new or on television. Thats my second reason for why you should agree that computer do help. My final reason for why computers benefit what the help, overall in other situations used later rather thab just the computer. For example one way the computer can help in the future, is that a student can research info a bout a subject online and it can help raise their grade on a project. Stedy has proven that computer training in the , by playing online games with other people, like in call of duty, helps boost soldiers' accorucy. it helps because it boosts their hand-eye coorination & we all increases their accuracy in target shooting @PERCENT1. This @MONTH1 not seem like much but, on the battle field, it can make the difference between life on death. Computers not only help that but they are plentiful & can be used in places such as libraries on internet cafe. That my final reason for why you should go with computers. Some people might believe that computers are bad thing sina they take time away from exercise, but that can easily be solved by using the internet to buy an indoor joggee. Computers benefit society by using online. the internet, and overall help in future situations. There are the reasons for why I believe you should go for the cause of computers. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion.",4,5,0
1428,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think computers do benefit society because computers can do alot of things like teach you. Computers are very helpful now, mostly every thing gets done on it. The computer teaches good eye cordination, how to focus, and show you stuff you don't know about. Without an computer you really can't get any thing done or reddy. A computer can be helpful for lots of things like job aplications of taxe's, or at a grocry store register, typeing and being on the computer is exercising but not for your body. When your on a computer exercise your hand's and your brains. With out computers you really cant do any thing. Mostly everything you do in life have to deal with some type of computer. I think that the people that said they shouldnt be on the computer is wrong because they can interact with there family that's far away thats also on the. You can enjoy nature by just takeing a look old you don't have to walkt out. Thats why I think computers are positive and helpful.",3,3,0
1755,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are used everyday by millions of people. I believe that the technology of computers have a positive effect on people. I think computers have a positive effect on people because people use them for research. People use computers to communicate with people far away. Computers are even used as a news resource. In my opinion, computers make things easier. Computers have a positive effect on people because they are very helpful. You can use computers to research different things. @CAPS1 you have a computer, you can learn new things about places you never knew existed. For example, @CAPS1 you have a homework assignment, you don't have to use a book to get information, you can just use your computer. So, for those reasons, I think computers have a positive effect on people. Computers are always being used for several things. However I think people used computers the most for communication. On a computer you can communicate with friends and family members that live in other states. Instead of sending letters to people by mail, now a days people use e-mails and instant message. You can talk to people faster this way and it's much easier. Computers have a positive effect on people. It's makes some things in life much easier. I don't understand why they would have a negative effect on people. It's the year @DATE1, and computers are used for basically everything. Remember how we used to have to read the newspaper to find out about breaking news and important things? Well, since we have computers a lot of people don't read newspaper. On the computer you can read the whole newspaper, and even find out more about things that happen in our world. So what's the point of even reading the newspaper, @CAPS1 you have a computer? I believe computers have a positive effect on people's life because you can do anything on the computer. You can research information, commmunicate with people, and use it as news resource. Doesn't that make lif a lot easier? So why do some people think computers have a negative effect on people?",4,4,0
223,"Dear @LOCATION1, I think the way how more and more people use computers are bad because, @NUM1 int's not good for people's health, @NUM2 people who use computers lots of times, refuse to spend time with family and friends and @NUM3 you can find more about something that's on a computer by going and studying it yourself. My first reason why computers have bad effects on people who use computers, is the health issue. Health in very important but sitting in front of a computer for hours makes matters worst. By the way you hunch your back in order to see something small on the computer creen, or when you hold on the mouse, waiting to click onm something for long period of time, can cause arthrities. My second reason why computers have bad effects on people who use them. Are that people who are on computers & end to sometimes refuse to spend time with family or friends like for example: @CAPS1 say a week ago you made a promise to have a family get together with the family, and they all count on you to come, @CAPS2 you get a computers, you go on all these neat websites that you never heard off it's amazing right! WRONG! before you know if, it's the day for the family get together and your line an hour @CAPS4 you amke excuse not to come. And that breaks you family's heat....My last reason why, to me computers are a bad idea is you can learn about another the computer by going on to a But its ore fun traveling or meeting people from that place @CAPS2 setting in a for and having your neck, back and sore @CAPS3 I right, I think I @CAPS3. Also idsfun to and ear foods from the culture that you fing cool off that lame computers.(To me that sounds like a good time to invite family and friends!) @CAPS4 therefore in conclusion, in my personal opinion computers have bad effects of people health, it can cause later bacj and neck problems maybe even activities. People who use computers a lot or love to spend time on computers refuse to spend time with family and friends, and @NUM3 You can find more about something like a culture or land, if you go and study its yourself instead of going on a computers for hours. I hope my opinion convinces others, hoe computers have bad effects on people who use it a lott, and take action into their own hands and do what is right.",4,4,0
703,"Dear local Newspaper I believe that computers are a great help to society I will explain my thoughts and ideas to you. I hope you agree with me after reading this. For starters, I would like to say that my first subject is communication, computers allow us to talk to everyday folks or folks that are around the world! There are many ways to talk, text, speech, and webcam, and it is not like you cannot talk to them there are hundreds of communication cients, servers online @NUM1 usually, so you will always be able to someone! Secondly, I would like to say computers have a great way of creation. On a computer you can program @CAPS3, design presentations, documents, drawings, maps, graphs, almost anything you put you mind to can be virtually made. You can gather information from servers websites, @CAPS1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 you can create and learn a lot on your everyday computer. I am not fisned! There are @CAPS4, @CAPS5, @CAPS6, reading, book sites all on the web! This gives the opprotunity of the ""web searcher"" to have a vast ammount of information! and allow he or she to learn alot more in every day life. Finaly, I would like to say that computers has a wide range of entertennent! There are many to choose from like videos, movies, @CAPS18, @CAPS1, games anything that is suitable for the user or users of the computer. On a game a user @MONTH1 talk to friends, while @CAPS14 a game such as a (@CAPS8 @CAPS9) for example @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12 online, @CAPS13 @CAPS14 game. These kinds of games skyrocket entertennent lovers for the vast ammount of enjoyment they can endure while @CAPS14 a @CAPS8 @CAPS9. Another type of entertennent is videos people can watch videos and movies on a video and more website which has a database of not thousands but millions of videos and movies. Whatever the user wants is a text and a click away! The last type of entertennent is @CAPS1 and @CAPS18, these allow the user to daily life or take to friends, family or relatives. To sum this all up I would like to tell you Local news paper that you should agree that computers are a good thing for the society! Please reread and pick the right @CAPS2!",4,4,0
1438,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3't it about time we start thinking more about the digital age. Computers has contributed so much to society for many years and up to this point I don't believe the world would be able to function without it.Some people say that computers @CAPS3't good for society but do they really believe that computers gave us the internet, email, most jobs depend on the internet, even games, and many more let me explain. First of all without computers there would be no internet and without that many jobs would fail. Most jobs need the internet to work like architects need the computer to design buildings and houses. Almost every office has computers for many different reasons. Writers need the computers to wright books, if they were hand writen some people might not be able to read it, so if there was no computers thousands of people would loose their jobs. My mothers works on a computer she would loose her job. Not only that but we need computers for school. If I had to write a paper on a person it would be almost impossible to do without looking up information about him on the internet. Also with writing a paper, some teachers only exept typed papers. How are we suppost to do that if we didn't have computers that makes home work a lot easier. Lastly, computers lets us explore new places. Goole @LOCATION1 is a map of every place on @LOCATION1 that we can see. If you need to find out where something is you can always count on the internet. If you need direction you can print them out off the internet. Also if you need to find out what somthing means instead of using an dictionary use the computer. Now can you see how much the computer benefits society. Some people say that other people take too long on the computer but you don't have to. I don't know any one that uses the computer for more then work or school.",4,5,0
902,"I think that computers help people in there everyday lives. They just make things so much easier. Computers help us to find information @CAPS2 we needed. Book hotels and airliners, they even allow us to interact with our friends. Yes it might take away times to do other things like exercising, but we can find out away to do both. Everyday I would go on the computer a little bit and then go outside for an hour to play basket ball. People just need to find a way to it out. Computers are good for if you need to find information about anything. All you need to do is type in what you want, and within seconds you have hundreds of different links for your desire. For example if you are in @CAPS1 school and you are deciding what college that you should go try the a great place that you can go to get information. People all over the world do that just about everyday. It is also a great place if you need information if you are doing a project in school and you need more info on your subject @CAPS2 I say it make things a lot easier there is no better example a reservation for a hotel or buying a plane ticket. Both of those things do on a computer because otherwise odds are you with of then. If we didn't have computers you would need to go to the hotel and get a room, and if there were no room you out of luck. On a computer it will say if they have any or not you would need to @CAPS3 tickets would have the exact same thing. Computer say @CAPS2 there are available flights to your destination and how much. So @CAPS2 you go to the airport you are not surprised. Another good reason why computer are good for people is that it helps your interact with your friends and family @CAPS2 you can't see them. There so many different ways you can do it to. On @CAPS4, @CAPS5, myspace. All the websites like that help you stay in touch with all of your friends. Even now they have somethings where you can actually see the person you are talking to over the computer. So if you have no chance of seeing each other anytime soon you can talk to them then. I even do that with my brother, he is in college and I dont see him that much so I just start chatting with him on the computer. Now those are some reasons on why I feel that computers are a great part of our lives. Thing like finding information and booking hotels, airplanes, ect. All help make our lives a lot easier at times. And talking with other people just makes us happy. Now I hope you see why computers are a good part of all of our lives.",5,5,1
96,"The use of computers is definetly correct. It is helpful, you can discover new things and much more. Computers makes peoples lives just so much simpler. Computers can help people in magnificent ways by looking for things you despretly need. Like if you were a student and you had to write a paper on @PERSON1. The computer has internet and that like billions of facts @PERSON1 and much more information about every thing. It can be helpful also by looking up the wheather, the new, even things that are happening around the world and even answering questions you have. Discovering things on the computer is something that happens every day. For example I read an article about the @CAPS1 and the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 the next day my teachers gave us a pop quiz on that and I got @NUM1. If a computer can get somebad a @NUM1 on their test think of what else it could do for the world. It might even help sae lives. Of course a computer can be helpful. In way like cheeking the score from yesterdays game, see whats going on in your community, watch videoes, hear music, talk to your friends, relatives get information on places, medical stuff.

Now, everyone knows his name and listens to his music. Like @PERSON2, the more wordy folks can express themselves by blogging their opinions. "" About half of computer use, "" says @CAPS1 to computer weekly, @PERSON4,"" is using blogs and videos to state one's ideas."" @CAPS3 can persuade others to think @CAPS2 @CAPS3 do and discover thngs that @CAPS3 have discovered. Self-expression is very important to society, and this is why computers have such an affect on people. @CAPS2 it is clear, computers have a positive affect on people and society.

Computers can also teach hand-eye cordination. People who support advances in technology, believe computers have a positive effect on people. Without computers people could not learn new things. On a computer you can learn about new places. People could see where something is, locate it, or learn about the place. I remember when I was working on a project about @LOCATION2. I had no clue what to do on the topic, so I whent on the computer and looked up @LOCATION2. It told me @LOCATION2 was located in @LOCATION1. Then it showed me a picture of @LOCATION2, and the history of the country. Without the computer I would not have been able to learn about this fasinating country. On a computer you can also learn about historic and famous people. On computers you can read biographies of them, or watch videos of whay they did to become famous. People used to read news out of a newspaper, on computers you can too without paying the cost of buying a newspaper. Computers can also give you a live feed of what is happening in the world. Without computers people could not learn. On computers you can also communicate with people that are very far away. Scientist did a study on how people communicate. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 said they used a computer to comunicate with other people. People can use a webcam, aim, or email to communicate with other people. To communicate with my family in @LOCATION2 I use a webcam. To communicate with my friends I use email or aim. Writing letters is to slow, on computer the other person your talking to can reply immediately. On a computer communication is made easier. A computer can also teach you hand-eye cordination. On a computer you see something on the monitor and you can click it without looking down at the mouse to click. This can help you in sports and give you fast reflexes. In many sports you need hand-eye cordination. For example, in basketball you need to look up while you dribbling or you while fall. Computer can give people fast reflexes and helps people in sports.

Well, if you are, it's time to get off the spinning computer chair and out for soem fresh air. Most kids spend most of their time on the computer @CAPS1 or on @CAPS2 or @CAPS3. It @MONTH1 be good for kids to interact with kids out of school but sooem kids take it way to far. They never go oitside and get any excirsize. this is not good for a growing teen. They need to be up and active. So, limit yourself time you spend on the computer. Without a doubt, computers are very bad fro youe eyesight. Unlike @CAPS4 or video games you could play a long distance away, a computer is played @NUM2-7 inches from the over time, your eyes will be so use to sitting @NUM2 inches from what your recating, that when you back up you  erad at all. I knew this who played video games from about @NUM8 foot away for long period of time a day. Today, unfortunately, the kid is blind if that kid just knew the consequences of being that close to a @CAPS4 screen, he would have thought twice about it. Think twice about how close you sit from the computer. if I were to ask anyone of you what you could find on the internet @PERCENT1 of you would say, ""anything."" could there really be too much information? As a matter of fact, tehre is. You could be looking up a topic and something inapropriot, that has nothing to do with the topic comes up kids doin't need to, and shouldn't be watching or seeing these inapropriot sites. Its bad for kids, so stop it! After reading this essay, I hope you realized that computers are bad for you in various ways. As a matter of fact it's physically, mentally and socially. So, next time your on a computer, don't look at the little things, but the big picture!",5,5,1
1052,"Did you know that @PERCENT2 out of @PERCENT1 children today, prefer to play games on the computer than do other activities? My opinion about this topic is that it is more important for children to do things other than sit on the computer all day. The reasons why I feel this way is because it is important to exercise, children tend to be addicted to playing on the computer, and if someone's life revolves around the computer than they most likely, won't be able to live on the ""real world"". When a child sits at the computer all day, they are not getting exercise. Today, obesity is a major problem. If people stay on the computer less and exercise more than this situation could decrease. Also, it is important for children to get fresh air. When someone plays on the computer they are not getting as much fresh air as you would outdoors. Lastly, who realize the importance of exercise tend to participate in sports, to stay active and have fun. Once you begin to play games on the computer, there is not turning back. In today's society, children of all ages, become addicted to the computer. Children who are addicted pay no attention to their surroundings. Also, some of these games might be inappropriate for younger players. Lastly, if children become addicted, they could do poorly in school for refusing to do homework. If a child is constantly on the computer than they have a chance of not being prepared for the ""real world."" In the ""real world,"" you can't rely on computer games. Also, games won't teach you things that you can only learn during school. Later in life, when you want to get a job, you won't be able to be accepted because you will not sound knowledgable. Lastly, when you are writing your application to go to a college, they will look at your records of sports and activities you've done in middle school. When they don't find anything, they will reject you because of your lack of participation. So when you are sitting at the computer screen, remember all the possibilities you have other than the computer. For example, it is important for you to exercise, playing games on the computer could make you addicted and you won't be prepared for te ""real world"". What is your opinion?",4,5,0
334,"@ORGANIZATION1, The use of computer per family has increased greatly in the past @NUM1 years. In that same time people are getting fatter and they need more exercise. If you use the computer it might break or not work properly. Computers are a big waste in time and a bigger waste in money. In the past @NUM1 years many people @MONTH1 have gained a lot of weight. They do not do regular activities like going to the supermarket because you can shop online. Studies show that if you go to the supermarket or a store you are likely to be less fat then if you shop on line. Another reason why computers dont give you exerise is because of google. If you wanted to see a picture of a beautiful mountain you could just go to google and type it in. It is a much easier way to see sights but if you walk you could burn up to @NUM3 times as much calories then if you just look it up on google. Another reason why computers dont give you exercise is you can get addicted to a game. Lets say that you have basketball practice at @NUM1:00pm. If you go on the computer at @NUM5 then you could easily get addicted to a game and forget you have practice. You would be stuck on your computer mindlessly typeing a way on a computer game that doesnt help you anywere in life. When you dont go to practice you will not sweat and therefore gain extra weight. Scients say that if you actully play a sport you can lose weight by up to @PERCENT1 then if you didnt. Before there computers life was simpole, no student forgot there homework. But now they use there computer many things can go wrong. First the printer can break. @CAPS1 year my printer stoped working @NUM1 times so I could not do my homework. My teacher said that forgetting my homework affectde my grade by over @PERCENT2. Another reason why handwriting is more convienet is you are capable of doing writing during school @CAPS1 year with my teacher @PERSON1 i had to write a prompt. She told me to go to the computer lab and type it but all the computers were taken. When I got down stairs she told me I had to write it so I got a @NUM7 because she could not read what I wrote. Every other kid got a @NUM8 or above but since I was not use to writing it affected my grade. Another reason why computers are inconvienet is when you need to do research. My parent got rid of our books a wile ago because of computers. So one day when I was home alone I had to reasearch euthonzing dogs on the computer but there was a power outage. I could not do my @ORGANIZATION1 events for science so I got a @NUM9 on it. That grade brought my adverage down form an a+ to an a-. The only reason why I got a bad grade because I depended on the computer for reasearch and it let me down. If I had better hand writing I would have gotten a better grade. The final reason why computers do not benifit society is because they are a waste of money. Most computers caust up to @MONEY1 for the computer and installing. There is no need for them because everything computers have a library can give. The library has books so you can reasearch with books insted of computers. In my house all @NUM7 people in my family has a computer but @NUM11 of the computers are used once a week. They are extreamly expensive and there is no need for them. Also my dad works at a computer store and he says that the computer people are overcharging by @PERCENT3. With that extra @MONEY2 you could buy many books and magisnes insted of a computer. That is why computers are not useful. People are not getting exercise, so the gain @PERCENT1 more weight. It is much less convienent then writing by hand. Finally they are a major waste of money. The decads without computers were much more useful and everyone lived happpier.",5,5,1
161,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Computers have a very positive effect on people. I agree that computers have a positive effect. They teach hand-eye coordination. It gives people the ability to learn about people and places, and you can talk online @CAPS3 first reason is that computers teach hand-eye coordination. for example, when you learn how to type, you can memerize the keys. Therefore, you don't have to look down at the keyboard. Computers also teach hand-eye when using a mouse. When you want to click on something you have to look at the screen and move the mouse to click on the icon. @CAPS3 final reason that computers teach hand eye is once you what to do, you don't have to serch the screen for an icon. You could just move the mouse to a spot on the screen and no what to do. Computers teach hand-eye coordination when you type, when you move the mouse to click on an icon, and when you memorize all of the icons. @CAPS3 second reason is computers make you smarter. For example, if you have a history project, and you need to know about china, you can use the computer. How many times would china be in the newspaper? Using the computer can access quick information. Another example is computers can find information on famous people no one knew about. You could be able to find what college a famous actor went to in a matter of seconds. @CAPS3 last example is that a serch engine can look up famous pictures. If you are working on a project that requires pictures, @ORGANIZATION1 can have the photos you need. Computers make you smarter because you can look up different countries, you could look up people, and famous countries. @CAPS3 last reason is computers give you the ability to talk online with friends, for example, you could catch up with friends you don't see that much during school. Talking online is just as fast as texting. Also, you could continue a conversation you had with a friend. Did the bell ring in the middle of a conversation? Well, you can continue it on @CAPS4, or @CAPS5. Lastly, you can just plain talk. You could make plans, or you can talk about upcoming events. Computers give you access to talking with your friends. In conclusion, computers do have a positive effect on other people. You can get hand-eye coordination, you can look up foreign countries and people, and you can talk with your friends.",5,5,1
1214,"Dear @PERSON1, Computers are necessary and benefit our community. They do a great deal to help make our lives easier. There is not a day that we do not use a computer in some way or another. The benefits of our computers are they connect us, the spread news, and they make every day objects work. Computers connect us in so many difffrent ways. Where would businesses be without computers? Most modern day businesses are run by computers. Owners can now have businesses all over the world. With computers a business in @LOCATION2 or somewhere else in @LOCATION4 can be connected with a building in @LOCATION1. They can have live video chats together. With the help of the computers they are able to contact any branch of their business all over the world. Even smaller businesses use the computer to connect to customers. Now a days we do a lot of online shopping. This is an example of how stores connect to their customers. Stores can show buyers everything they have to offer including store locations. This can help stores get more business by connecting the buyer to the shop. The computer not only connects stores and businesses but also people to people. @PERCENT1 of kids in my school own a computer. With all these computers many social networking sites are born. The most popular right now is @CAPS1. Students can connect to old friends from other places and even other countries. We have a live chat on @CAPS1 or even @CAPS2. @CAPS2 is instant messging which is, well, instant. With a simple click people are connected no matter how far apart they are. Therefore, computers conect people. Computers also broadcast news. Without the computers most of us would not no about world news. This includes the @LOCATION3 earthquake. If we did not have the computers to let us know about the earthquake in @LOCATION3 they would be in alot more trouble. They would not have all of these donations. Also computers even broadcast national news. Almost all newspapers are now online along with on paper too. Anyday now they will be completly online. This will drastically change how we learn about news. It would just be a click away. What would have taken days to get here now takes minutes or maybe even seconds. Science also benefits from computers. Phones now can be personal tws, inernet, and messaging devises. Phones are just a tiny version of a computer. Cars also have computers put into them. The @CAPS3 in our cars are computers; we would be lost without them. Also, in cars there are computers to run just about everything else. So, there is not a day where we do not incounter computers. In conclusion, computers benefit us in so many ways. They conect us deliver news, and are in almost all of our technology. Could you imagine life without computers?",5,5,1
1116,"Dear local newspaper, I am here today to state my reason why I am against usage of computers. My @NUM1 reason why I am against usage of computers is, the negativity, like for example too many pop ups come on the website your own and then they mini little advertisments like ""@CAPS1 on me"" ""free trial"". And thats not good for children to see when they are using the computer. My seocnd reason why I am against using computers is who's online when your up there. @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people use the computer every single day and @NUM3 out of @NUM5 people be up there chatting with young little girls and boys. And they older what then what they say. What I'm trying say is these people are called ""@CAPS2"". These people roam through the internet day and night trying to find little boys and girls. Just like I say earlier thats not good computer usage. The purpose of getting on the computer is look for information or play games no that other stuff. My final reason of being against computer is montoring, alot of parents dont watch their kids when they are on the computer, so most of the kids look at a lot of inapproiate sites or things that they shouldn't look at. And that be their fought beacuse they should have parental lock up there. In conclusion, basically what I am trying to say is computers can be dangerous sometime because you dont always know what your clicking on and you can @CAPS1 on the wrong thing and end up on a site that you don't want to be on. So just have my opinions and maybe you can understand what I'm trying to say. Thanks.",4,4,0
533,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 computers are a part of our advanced technology. They have a positive effect on people because computers make almost everything easier, they can teach people things with tutorial or educational websites and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and they keep people entertained in their spare time. Computers are becoming more and more advanced everyday and that's why I think people are so addicted to them, yet they do have positive affects. Computers make things a lot easier for a lot of people. If you really think about it, a lot of things that we use every day such as books, nice clothing, and music on the radio would not be here if it weren't for computers. We would have to hand write those books and hand sew our clothes. As for the music, we would just stomp our feet and clap our hands to make music. If ancient egyptians had computers, they would have built millions of @CAPS4. Our computers have programs like microsoft to help me do a major school assignment neatly. Computers have positive affects in this way. Everyday after I finish my homework and I go on the computer most adults think that all that us teenagers do on the computers are facebook and myspace. I do admit that I go on those websites, but if I notice that my grades are not in the best condition, I go on websites that can help me understand what I'm not getting. Ninety percent of the time that I do that my grades go up and I get a satisfying grade. I have also taught little cousins of mine how to add and subtract using the computer in pre-school. Computers are helping schools teach students. Besides education, computers can also keep us entertained with games such as virtual solitaire. When I go on the computer, I might need to research something that I have interest in. Maybe I might want to know when @LOCATION1 was invented or, if the universe ever stops. Maybe I don't want to watch @CAPS5 all day to keep me entertained. Computers will save me from bordom. When I use a computer, I am not addicted. In fact it has a very positive effect of me. Yes, I might stay up countless hours, talking to my friends on facebook, but to me that's a part of being a kid. The next day I might learn something in school that I want to search deeper into. That is what the computer is for. Without computers we would not have some of the knowledge we have @CAPS1. Their effect is the most positive effect on people, ever in my opinion.",4,4,0
921,"I believe that computers benefit society and help people understand things more clearly. Computers help people study, learn, and even talk to other people. Here are some good reasons on why computers help people out with problems. First of all, computers give you information on things that you cannot find in books. People can look up places for vacations, what their child's grade in school is, and find healthy food recipies. Without the computers people would be lost not knowing what to do. Next, computers let you talk to friends. You can discuss things like weather, ideas you have, you can even plan exercise days. What if something important happens? The person does not have his or hers phone. What could they do? They could go on the computer and tell their friend. It would be a lot easier than driving over to the persons house then driving driving all the way back. Finally, computers can give you a good sense of hand eye cordination. Computers can teach you how to type without even looking at the keyboard. This skill could be used to pursue a good career in the carpentry field. Computers can also help you study for a new job and what the requirements are. In conclusion, I believe that computers make peoples a little bit easier knowing that they have vital information right at the tips of their fingers. It can also help them in anything they want to do. Like talk to friends, look up info and teach skills.",4,4,0
1531,"Who in the world would say a computer is useless. No one, computer are one of the most useful device ever made. I think that computers are perfect and can help you build skills. I have @NUM1 reason it build skills, fast information and fun. Now lets get started with skill. Skills are things you need to have if you want to pursue a career. You can learn skill from book, tv and computers. For example i learned how to type rapidly on a keyboard from a computer on a game called type to learn. After a week of this game. I was typing like a pro. The computer also has chess to help build stragety. Just ask my super smart english teacher @PERSON1 ""she say that chess build's character and strength your mind. Moving along, i want to talk about how you can get information in a instant with computers. Experts say that it the number one way to get iinfo badly. I know i argeed with that, after study for a test on @LOCATION1 carver in my book, but one of my pages was missing so. I used my computer not only did i get my information quickly. I had gotten more information than the book. The next day i passed my test. @NUM2 percent . You how useful a computer can do. Finally, i want to talk to you about good old faishon fun. As you know are perfect for building skill and get information, but you can away alway use a computer for fun. Do you know anyone in the world that can say the computer is not fun. No you can't because everyone in the world use the computer for fun stuff like online game, video and talk to people. Thanks for my reason about computer building skill, having info and fun.",4,4,0
472,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology majors support that the use of computers have a positive effect on people and I agree with them. I believe the use of computers are a necesity for social interaction, homework, research, and are a great source of entertainment on a rainy day. After a long day at school @CAPS1 teens go from the bus, to the front door, to their computer chair. In fact, @PERCENT1 of must teens do so. Odds are they're logging into facebook, myspace, formspring, @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS2, and other socially interactive websites. With good time management I actually find these websites important. I think facebook and e-mail and @CAPS3 @CAPS4 ( @CAPS5) are a great way to be socially interactive. It's also a great way to keep in touch with long distance family or friends. I go to @DATE1 camp and have made friends I call my family. Some of them being across the ocean in @LOCATION2. Seeing as how I can't make long distance calls which would cost way too much money, facebook is a geat alternative to keep in touch. @CAPS1 of my family also live far away. For example, my aunt, uncle and cousin in @LOCATION1. My aunt just had a baby, meaning I have a new cousin which I'm not able to see in person yet so seeing pictures on facebook instead of spending money on envolopes, stamps and picture prints is really awesome @CAPS1 homework given out in school requires a computer. Three out of five homework assignments are on the computer. Whether it be taking a twenty question test to defining a word the computer is a schoolwork necesity. In school now many projects are assigned meaning we need the computer and internet. We use powerpoint and other microsoft documents whether it be typing an essay or creating a powerpoint slideshow. We need the internet for research to get the information we need, to suceed. Aside from interacting with other humans and researching and typing the computer holds many more wonders. Many people believe people are spending way too much time on the computer. While this @MONTH1 be true for some people it is not true for @CAPS1. Many people are concerned children are becoming lazy but in a recent vote @NUM1 out of @NUM2 mothers said they'd radther see their children playing and interacting on the computer then being a couch patato and watching @CAPS6. On a rainy day the computer can be a great alternative. You can slide in a @CAPS7 and watch a movie or play a game or even research something new and learn about it. @NUM3 out of @NUM2 @CAPS8 have at least two computers in the house for a reason. They're important to @CAPS1 people everyday lives. The computer is a great way to keep in touch with family and friends. You also need to computer for school almost all the time and on a rainy day its a great alternative then being lazy a watching @CAPS6 while your eyes fall asleep. I do believe computers have a positive effect on people.",6,6,1
494,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 generation has grown up with the complex technology called computers. I have learned over the years of using them, that they aren't as helpful as the seem. They can cause an addiction, and create numerous distractions. First of all. many doctors say that computers cause ""the new depression."" The internet is where most of this takes place though. For most teenagers, having a facebook, myspace, or formspring is not unusual. I know from personal experiences, that some people abuse these social networks and use them as another way to bully people. So therefore, not only do you get made fun of in school, but now, people can make fun of you in cyberspace.. This is the main reason that people become socially depressed. There is almost no way to escape it and all of their anxiouty really starts to get to them. Addiction to computers is also a very negative impact. Many people go on the internet and are so fascinated that, that is how they spend their free time. About @PERCENT1 of people say that they are addicted. From @CAPS1 experience with using the internet. I know that there is always something that pulls you back in. You know that you are on addict when you spend more than an hour a day on the computer. Parents always say that it is a self-control issue but many adults have the same problem. They have just started to be able to use the computers, so many times they go through a phase or addiction. Furthermore, this addiction problem would be totaly gotten rid of it we stopped using computers. Finally, computers also create many distractions to students. When students sit down to type their papers they also, many times, have another at the same time. Therefore they are getting barely any work done. Social networks only just make this even worse. Constantly chatting with someone can cause tou to loose track of time. Also, when you try to multitask with the internet. Therefore causing grades to go down or not complete home work on time. All and all, this is an issue that can be easily avoided by eliminating computers. In conclusion, computers do not help us. They cause social depression, which cause people to have anxiouty problems. They cause addiction, which end up taking over peoples lives. They create divertion that make concentrating hard. I feel that computers have negative affects and they should be gotten rid of completely!",4,5,0

Well I'm someone who does because they can talk to there family and friends on sites like facebook, myspace, & aim. They can also exercise on the internet because if they go to youtube, then they can find different types of positions that they can do. Today, over @NUM1 people use computers and it is like @PERCENT1 adults anfd @PERCENT2 children use computers which means that more kids today are doing athletic sports. The adults use computers for there work ability and in schools. At newspaper places, they need to have a computer just to type the daily papers and if there's no compers, then how ill the type there work. As people get home from wherever, and they didn't get the daily paper, the you can go online and look at it. For students, computers are so important to us because we get to talk to our friends and when we need to look up something, we just go to the internet. In some schools, they have really big books for different classes that they need to bring home. And that's bad for your back, so then schools came out with the books online. For those people who love sports, you can look up you favorite team and see if they won that weeks game. There is also vertual sport games that you can play for that is on the computer. When you first move somewhere oout of town, you can go to google and see where is a good town to live in and a good school system that you would want your child to go to.

1415,"Dear computer experts, @CAPS1 this: A family of four is sitting in a small dark room, not talking, not laughing, just sitting lazily in their chairs, hunched over & bored. They arenÂ’t communicating with any of their friends, and arenÂ’t really doing anything at all. They sit there like lumps. This would happen @CAPS5 we banned computers! Computers defenetly have positive effect on people because they feed you a constant stream of knowlage, they develop good hand eye coordination, and they enable the people who use them to communicate with others. Clearly, they are a positive addition to our world. To begin, computers bring you constant a stream of knowlage. My close friend @PERSON1 told me recently that she is sometimes sitting at home, and doing her homework, and she needs to look up something. She simply grab her computer, and the information is delivered to her with the click of a button. @CAPS5 she didnÂ’t have a computer sheld never obtain such knowlage. Second, in a survey of @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION1, @PERCENT1 of total computer usage is looking up information, and gaining knowlage. This statistic shows that computers defenetly help them when looking for information. Also a recent @ORGANIZATION3 article on computer usage states that @CAPS5 people didnt have computers, half of the worldÂ’s discoveries would not be around today. You can tell that the amount of knowlage that computers give us is very important! Next, using computers builds hand eye coordination as well. ChildrenÂ’s specialist @PERSON3 says, Â“@CAPS4 need to be able to play video games, even though they are usually discouraged on the computer. They build fantastic hand eye coordination, and help with many things including @ORGANIZATION1 & sports.Â” @CAPS5 there were no computers, this hand eye coordination could never developed! Also, at @ORGANIZATION2 in @LOCATION1, they limited computer use, and as a result of it, the sports teams there all got losing records. Could this be because of the lack of hand eye coordination of those students? Additionally, at @ORGANIZATION1, after a recent survey, it was discovered that @NUM1 students who play video games on their computers do better in gym class because of the added hand eye coordination. Clearly computers greatly build hand eye coordination. Lastly, using computer allows people to communicate with each other through email & other social networks. After a poll from www.@CAPS6.com, we have discovered that millions of users use the computer & @CAPS6 to communicate everyday. We wouldnÂ’t want to deny them of this, would we? Secondly, a friend of mine, @PERSON2, who goes to @ORGANIZATION4, says that the main way that she communicates with her friends & makes plans with them is by computer. @CAPS5 she didnÂ’t have one, none of this could be done. Furthermore, a recent article by @PERSON4 a teen specialist at @ORGANIZATION5 says that when people donÂ’t have computers & canÂ’t communicate or talk to the outside world, they are more prone to diseases & sickness like depression or anorexia. When they donÂ’t talk as much with their friends, these sicknesses are more prone to occur. This defenetly shows that communicating with computers is very important. Now, @CAPS1 this. The same family as before is sitting in bright, sunny room their computer screens flashing merrily. One of the boys calls out, Â“hey, look at his Â“ and the rest of his family rushes to his side. Their faces aglow with this @ORGANIZATION3 information. You can see that computers have a positive effect on people because they bring @ORGANIZATION3 information, they build hand eye coordination, and they allow you to communicate with others. So, computer specialists, what are you waiting for? Go to your computers right now & learn some @ORGANIZATION3 things!",6,6,1

Would you rather spend your time on the computer rotting like a vegetable or would you rather hang out with your firned, travel to other places that you never thought possive or even go to a gym and probably loose some pounds? I vote hanging out with my friends! You know people that like to travel to far away places and have fun would rather that than waste their time on a computer. As much as people like to look at all the cool places that they check out on the internet; what's the point in just sitting their and watching the screen when you could get a plane ticket and fly to the magical place that you saw on the computer. Ok. I know that traveling to faraway places can be scary because you never been to area in your life, but @CAPS3's worth the try. Ok fine if flying is not your thing then why not thy exercising. @MONTH1 be you have been trying to lose some extra pounds. You could always try that. Think about @CAPS3, my mother was using her so that she could fit into a size @NUM1 and now look she is in a size @NUM1. Why bore yourself to death with computers that will probably give you the wrong advise when you could always ask a friend for advise. Yes a friend a live and breathing human being, losing some weight will help you gain confidence if you just try. @CAPS3's just like @PERSON1, from @CAPS2 lower said, you got to want @CAPS3 if you want to accomplish that goal of yours. Everyone can go for that goal! Maybe you dont want to exercise, maybe you want to hang out with your friends and family. If you waste your time online chatting, how are you oing to chat with the people that are eight in front of you. If you can talk online then you can probably talk to people in real life? Right? Wrong! Some people can and some people cant. I am a very talk person, but I know how to talk on line if. I wanted to so why cant you? That's @CAPS3 the time has come t decide. Do you want to spend your time on or computer or do you want to spend your time in the real world. Get out your chair, turn off the computer get up. Put your wat on and walk outside and do something with yourself. Use you mouth not your hand. Talk to people comunicate with them @CAPS3 is not that hard. Trust me. If I can do @CAPS3 you can do @CAPS3 too! @CAPS3's now or never I choose now and so should you. Dont waste anymore time, go on a trip take a hangout. Just do @CAPS3. Dont run back to that computer. Throw @CAPS3 out you can live without @CAPS3.",5,5,1
273,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I think that computer have bad effects on people. The first reason why I think this is because people in the world are becoming less healthy kids and adults should stay @CAPS3 more. Kids and parents should only be aloud @NUM1 @CAPS4 on the computer then go outside. Computers are not so bad because @CAPS5 is helpful for looking up information but @CAPS5 is harmful @CAPS5 u abuse @CAPS5 kids play games on the computers and @CAPS5 damages there eyes and @CAPS5 makes them lazy. Also going outside there are lots of things to do instead of talking with your friend on the computer you should call your friend ask him to come over play games outside. @CAPS6 this continues lots of kids will be fit and @CAPS3. The second reason why computers are bad is because of what people past on the computer about other people. Do not ever put something put something bad up on the computer because sometimes they are deep secrets and million of people will see @CAPS5 and that person might be teased and laughed at. And really the computer could do horrible things @CAPS6 you and this person are freinds @CAPS5 could break you guys forever. The final reason why the computer is not good is because people are dieing from overweight there is several teams that are on comercials saying that kids and adults @CAPS7 up and be @CAPS3 @CAPS6 @CAPS5 wernt for theese heros much much more kids would die faster, when kids die they look at whats in side of them and scientest found big fat chunks around the kids heart. Well thats my theory I hope all of you listen to my advice @CAPS7 up shut the computer of and @CAPS7 @CAPS3.",4,4,0
1018,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 back a couple decades ago, before computers existed. What do you see? There were children outside exercising, playing with friends, and living somewhat danger-free lives then came the computer. Computers are driving the next generation to a dangerous life of staring at an assortment of pixers all day longels well as ruining any civilized relationships you had. I strangly believe that computers have a negative affect on society. Did you know that as tha number of computers sold increases the obesity rate has gone up @PERCENT1 since computers came into our lives why? Because people spend way too much time on and not enough time exercising! Computers another affect of the long hours spent in front of screen is a decrease in eyesight ability. My family friend, @PERSON2 had to get glasses because his eyes were damaged by the computer. ""I'm worried about my daughter's eyes...she stares at that screen for hours on end!"" @CAPS2 @PERSON3, a concerned parent at @ORGANIZATION1. How could something so harmful possibly be good for our society? Speaking of hurtful, the internet is very unsafe. Predators surf the web, looking for young, innocent people to meet and most likely abuse @PERCENT2 of parents much been monitoring their children's computer usage parents are unaware that the internet makes it easy to talk to anybody in the world, from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2! Monitoring would also come in handy when it comes to innapropriate videos, pictures, and discussions on the internet. It is so easy to be surfing the web and fall upon things you should not be seeing! Lastly, people easily get caught up in being hidden behind a computer, and say mean, hurtful things that would never be said to one's face! these unfortunate factors cause many of the issues between people today. Speaking of which, computers have a very negative affect on relationships nowadays. As I mentioned earlier, so many fights happen through computer communications. Even if online conversations are friendly, they get people accustomed to making people ""@CAPS3"" through a computer, not face to face. After being in a computer-oriented friendship, people tend to forget how to act face to face and find personal meetings awkward. @PERSON1, an eighth grader at @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS4, ""I can't @CAPS5 only talking through computers, never being civilized with other human beings! Unfortunately, that is where computers are leading us to..."" @CAPS5 never seeing your best friend in person , only through technology! It @MONTH1 not even be your friend. It could be a dangerous poser! This is yet another problem...through the internet, you @MONTH1 not even know who such relationships are with! It could be fake, and you'd have no idea. Spending all day rolling away in front of a computer, putting yourself and relationships in danger is, unfortunately, the effect of computers. Computers are not worth the terrible consequences civilization must face. I @CAPS6 urge you to stop the advances in technology now, before it is too late! Make the change today.",5,5,1
1729,"Computers have gotten more advanced over time. They have even gotten smaller and smaller, and yet people still don't understand the dangers that computers have on society and their personal life such as; stress, addiction, and cyberbulling. I am here to write about how computers are a nuisense in our lives. First and for most, computers are one of the laeding causes of stress in daily life. About four out of every ten people that are stressed are stressed out because of their computers. For example, if you were writing an important document or sending an email to your boss about work and your computer suddenly crashes, would you be upset? Would you feel like you want to rip your hair out and throw that computer out the window? I'm pretty sure that you would because your data is lost, you will have to restart your computer and, worst case senerio, take your computer to the electronic store to get it fixed. Another cause of stress is if someone hacks your computer by uploading a virus. Hacking was @CAPS1 become a world wide sport. There are books and instructions on how to hack a computer and the government can't do much about that since the first amendment gives you the write to publish what you (freedom of speech and press). Just look what happened in @LOCATION1. A computer hacker hacks a computer and shut of power to an entire city for about @NUM1 days. Also if someone upload a virus into your they can take all of your personal information, like your social security number. These two factors will cause major stress in you daily life. Secondly, people spend too much time on the computer at home. A recent survey shows that six out of every ten teenagers spend more that two hours on the computer. This make them less social meaning they won't spend time with friends, family, or even try out for sports. They won't get the recommended one hour of exercise a day.",4,4,0
204,"You want my opinion on the effects computers have on people? Well, I believe that computers help people educate people and some computers people relie on. It's time to decide if you agree with me that computers have positive effects on people. Do you agree with me that computers can help people? Say for example you have a question noone in your home can answer. Why not @ORGANIZATION2 it? Of course once in a while you're going to get a school project. Surely you'll need information, but the library is closed. And you don't @CAPS3 what to do. Simple, all you have to do is reasearch it on your computer. Don't you agree that computers help people? I remember this one time I entered a @CAPS1 contest, and the @CAPS2 I needed was lost, then I remembered I put it in my computer. Computers can be relied on by people. Just think about it! Almost over @PERCENT1 of jobs out in the world relie on the technology of a computer. For example the @ORGANIZATION1 job. It would be kind of hard to keep track of how much trash is thrown out every year without a computer, surely banks use computers too! To keep track of everyone's allowance and money situations. Let's not forget about what lawyers do? There are some lawyers incart who use the computer to type up every word said. They turn the words into short and to keep up with what people are saying. Did you @CAPS3 that without these computers ever half the million jobs in the world would fail? Some people would agree that some online games are educational. For example, there is @CAPS4. That game teaches you words you probably never seen before. And don't forget @CAPS5. That game improves your counting of numbers. Last, but not least would be @CAPS6 @CAPS7. That game sharpens your skill and exercises your brain. Strategy come in handy, surely you now see that some games are very educational. In conclusion, I agree that the effects computers have on people are positive. Because computers help people, are reliable, and can educate people. It's now or never do you agree that computers have positive effects on people?",5,5,1
1393,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper, @CAPS2 when you were a kid? There weren't any computers or other electronics except the telephone. The computer is very advanced and helps people in many different ways, such as: hand-eye cordination, learning and being able to talk online. These things benefit society and prove the advancement in technology. The computer teaches hand-eye cordination when people don't even realize @CAPS5, through typing whether typing an email or an essay your hands are working and helping you. The hand-eye cordination that people learn on a computer can be used for sports. @PERSON3, a @NUM1 years old tennis player, said, ""I used to go on the computer everyday and play tennis later, and eventually the computer helped use with my favorite sport."" Hand-eye cordination is very useful, for many things our surveyed @NUM2 people and @NUM3 of these people say that hand-eye cordination is a very important still and that everyday activities, such as computers, help them improve. Typing is very comonly used while sending emails because they are fast, fun, and let you comunicate. When talking on a computer there are many new ways that are popular and fast, such as email welcoms aim, facebook and many more. @CAPS5 is nice to be able to talk to friends and family online because other options are more expensive. For example, many live on @LOCATION1 and her sister, @PERSON4, she is very close to, lives in @LOCATION3. They can't talk to each other a lot because neither of their calling plans allow them to call without charging hundreds of more money. They also can't fly to use each other because plane tickets are expensive these days. Also, the economy isn't doing that great, so they couldn't stay in-touch until webcams come out. Now, they see each other almost every week. Many said, ""I was considering flying to @LOCATION3, but now the webcams and email are useful and save us both a lot of money."" People @MONTH1 argue that you can just sent letters to each other, but, you can't send your baby boys first steps that you just video taped, or a youtube video that is really cute. Also, you can meet new people online that you @MONTH1 not've seen normally and when you can stay in touch, you can stay much closer to each other. Even though computers are great for fun, working and learning are much easier online. When online, everything that can be learned is amazing whether @CAPS5's what means or the earthquake in @LOCATION4. Being able to keep track of everything in one computer is amazing. @PERSON2, a @NUM4 @CAPS3 teacher at @LOCATION2, says, ""@CAPS4, we are trying to make more things electronic to protect the planet, so use don't waste paper and will trees."" @CAPS5 is true, about @PERCENT1 of the homework of @NUM5 graders is online, whether @CAPS5 is to look up the equation for photosynthesis on to find out what year @CAPS6 died in being online does help the environment @CAPS5 is important to be able to have computers in schools because @CAPS5 gives more chances for kids to learn more things faster, like @NUM6 graders have a math class online, off hey math. @CAPS5 gives people more information coming from more people. Online, you can read a scientists' expierement or a paparatzi's take on @PERSON1' new boyfriend. The computer has changed society a lot, for the better. Now, in the @DATE1, computers are part of the everyday lives of people in which they benefit. With better hand-eye cordination, being able to talk your friends, and being able to learn the computer benefits society.",5,6,1

1318,"Dear editor, I agree with having computers in our homes. I think that computers are good because of these reason. The computer has a-lot of information that you can look up. Also the computer can save a-lot of important things you need. Then you can comunicate with people far away. I think that a computer is a really good thing becouse you can look up varius things like something about someones life that way important. You can look up a website that tells you about a word or a car that you need to learn about for school or work. You can look up something that happed a long time ago @NUM1 or @DATE1 that was a. Then you could look up a your family tree and send out who you are routed to one how was or family in the past time, you could look up your book account or your e-mail on the computer to. So this is one reason that I think a computer is good for. Another reason why I would think that a computer is a good thing for anyone it can save a-lot of important things. Some you could save important from your past. Also you need save your reports for your school or work. Then you can save pictures from when you you on occation. You could favorite websites to your favorites so you can go to it any time you want to. This is another reason why I think computers are a good thing. One last reason why I think that computers are a good thing is because you can comunicate with people far away. You can have family that just went on and you can keep in touch with them through your e-mail, myspace, facebok, ect. You could vidio chat with your friends or family that lives in a diffrent place. You could go in chats with your co-workers or your boss for a meeting. This is anothe reason why I think computers are a good thing. So as you can see this is why I think computers are a good thing because of you can look up things, how you can save important things also because you can go and comunicate with your friends. So this is why I think computers are a good thing.",4,4,0
1732,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION1 are a major part in everyday life. They are used by just about everybody. There are so many benefits if you know how to use one propurly. They help you through everyday life whether your trying to find this song that is stuck in your head or trying to file you taxes, computers are a nececity in every house hold. They are also a great way to learn. You can look up a question that has been buging you or you could learn to play a new song on your favorite instrement. Either way your learning. So I think that computers deffinetly have more of a positive effect on society then a negative one. Computers are also a great way to interact with family and friends. Some computers even have built in cameras that lets you hold conversations with peers through the computer while seeing each other. This is great if you have family that lives far away, or your in a long distance relationship. Another benefit from the computer is that it is great for organizing things. Wheither it been @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 you can count on your computer to keep it all organized some computers also have a built in callendar that could help you plan out your day. But say you don't know what to do that day. Well that brings me to my next point. Computer are also great for looking up places. For instance say you fly to @LOCATION1 for the first time on a buisness meeting and you arrive a few days before the meeting. So maybe you diside to go sight seeing to some of @LOCATION1's most eligant spots, but have a computer you could look up some spots and be on your way to having a great day. Overall I think that computers make the world go round. They will never die out, that is why everybody should know how to use one, and if you don't you should hurry and learn as soon as possible.",4,4,0

If someone I knew spent all day long on the computer I would tell him or her head on that he or she sould go out side and get some fresh air and get some exrcise. Some times the only way to make contact with them is by talking to them on the computer. Although the computer can be quit helpful by looking up important artifacts or important information about medical plans, tutorials of how to fix, make, or biuld things, and to meet new people, But, the computer can be a dangerous place as well you can meet someone who is lieing about their age that person might rape or miurder/kill you. If you spend twenty-four seven on the computer you could be paralized from lack of exercise or get lumf ophemia thats when your body a pears and will not be a to exercise and would need special treatments. Like masogise. Computers can also be good because it can give you hand eye coordination by useing the still looking sometimes some people for useing the computer: videos, video, and websites.

We can learn @CAPS5 that are going on from far away. An example is if we have a big project in @CAPS1 @CAPS2 about @LOCATION2, and we dont know the computer can look all different focus and see pictures. Computers can the history of place not us.

All of these @CAPS5 can us research projects many other @CAPS5. We can also use computers. Computers also have different @CAPS5.

Do not get me wrong. I do not like to go on the computer bat their are so many reasons why computers affect alot of children and some adults in this generation. Like one reason is when people are on the computer all day long they do not get enough exercise. That is why kids these days are so over wheight there are more than @NUM1 million children over wheight because of the computer . Like for me I use to love goin on the computer and I still do bat I see that the computer is dostroying my heatlh. A second reason why I believe is bad for the generation because there are alot of inapropreate sites on the internet, where kids that are @NUM2 and younger could be logging on to. I think that people all over the world should start enjoying nature, go travle the world. Start doing things that people cant do on the computer. I think that more kids should start interesting with family and friend more often. of talking to your friend all the time. My last and finally reason that is a big thing is going on in the computer is people bullying other people the internet, local newspaper have would you if you have any daughters, sons, grand and. If they was getting bullyed over that internet or concern them to kill them or hurty them. I think you would horribly and you would want that person to go to jail.

972,"Dear @CAPS1 Newspaper I'm writing a letter to you about how I feel about the effects that computers have on people. One of my reasons is that people that spend to much time on the computers they are litting their lifes pass by them. But the people that work on computers all day is a different thing. My second reason is that people could be on the computers and still interact with their family because they live with each other. My last reason is why do people want to be on computers all day. I'm not talking about the people that work on computer. My last reason is that the people that is spending all their time on the computer they are letting their lifes pass by there. The reason I say this is because if you are on the computer @NUM1 your life is passing by you. Because you are not doing nothing, just sitting in a chair in the computer getting fat. Also if you are going to be on the computer at least they to find a job on the computer. But I'm not talking about the people that work in computer all day long, because they have to do it. Its their job to. Thats one of my reasons. My second reason is that the people this me in the computer they still interact with their family. The reasons I say this is because you could be on the computer and will interact with my family because you live it the same huge as them, two when you are not in the computer you could be with your family and spend time with them. That's why i said that you still could interact with your family even you see on the computer. The last and final reason is do people to spend most of their lifes on the computer. The person I like this because type of person would spend most of their life on the computer and don't go find a job go enjoy their life. Also if you got kids you have fun with your children and make them believe that they parents that was to them, that, they had fun with them, and that they had somebody that they could look up too. So don't spend your life time on the computer geting fat, not spending time with their children and make something yourselfs. But I'm not talking about the people that workon computers. I'm talking about the people that don't work on computers. Thats why I said don't let youre life pass by you. i hope you liked the prompt and that you wont spend a lot of your life in the computer doing nothing just getting fat and letting your life pass you.

It helps students with projects, helps people learn about other places, @CAPS1 it helps you find information on something you didn't know. @NUM1 precent of all teachers give out computer projects. Most reading teacher will have you read a book and then type a essay or a review about your book. Most teacher prefer the essay typed and not written. By the teacher giving that assignment he/she is giving the student the ability to explore out side of always writing. And I believe other students would agree with me, @CAPS2 better to type the essay than to write it! Is there a place out there that you really want to know more about, that you hope to someday visit? Well you can always use the computer to find out more about the place. You can use the computer to learn when is the best times to visit that place. @CAPS1 if you just heard on the news about a tradjic accident like the eartquake over in @LOCATION1, and you want to keep in touch on what is happening in that place you can use the computer. The computer will keep you updated on what is happening there everyday.

1000,"The effect computers have on humans is by far a positive one, and the outstanding intelligence computers provide must be embraced, not feared and avoided. Whether we like it or not, computers will be necessary to solve issues of the future. Besides, for personal usage, computers are highly beneficial. The main reason people fear computers is because of the dangers is radiates, which really isn't reasonable, when analyzed closely. To not use such a complex and developed system such as the computer is completely irrational, the computer is the future plain and simple. It is inevitable that the computer and technology related to that, paint the picture of the future of our world. Whether people like the concept or not, computers will be necessity to solve the problems and calamities that will wreak havoc on the world in time. Computers can predict natural disasters, and with that, people in the area of the catastrophe's destination can be evacuated. Lives can be saved. Computers can calculate, pollutional margins, and provide solutions to the large amount of pollution humans release in the air and @CAPS1. @ORGANIZATION1 Nature can be spared. So much more can be attained by putting the computer to full use. People must adapt to @LOCATION1 technology, or we will fall behind and watch our @CAPS1 slip away. This proves the effect computers have on people is not only positive, but necessary to advance in an ever-growing world. Stepping down to a less global level of effects and to a more personal level proves to also be beneficial to humans. Computers in most cases, do better work and create less error than humans themselves. Instead of requiring humans to work in dangerous locations such as deep water, computers can be sent down to visualize the before unattainable areas. Also, faster communication is extremely helpful in certain circumtances, such as an occurance in a workplace causing the area to be off-limits. As member of the workplace can simply e-mail his employer, informing them of the accuracy and preventing them from putting themselves in danger, or simply preventing men the trouble of a commute to work. Even from @LOCATION1 to @LOCATION2, with simply the press of ""@CAPS2"", people across the world can be of the accident. Foreign communication, specifically by means of instant messaging can strengthen our tie with other nations, in the fields of both business and government. Lastly, finding information, is so easy with a @CAPS3. Where would be without computers to find information rapidly? We would be still going to the library and checking out books, reading through page after page to find the information that would have taken less even a minute on a computer. Even a person agreed computer would have to admit that to be highly beneficial. As you can see, on even a less global level of use, the computer still proves to have a positive effect on its users. The one thing, parents especially, that fuels the negative opinion on computers is safety and reliability. When these two topics are analyzed, it is so simple to eliminate unreliability and danger of the computer. Installing a program of which there are infinite to choose from, that allows ""good"" websites to be viewed, and ""bad"" on potentially dangerous @CAPS4 to be binded. This eliminates all that is heard about on-line interactions and activity gone bad. Even without software to block dangerous websites, computers are generally safe. Only @NUM1 out of @NUM2 websites, includes content considered ""detrimental"" to humans. Also, of those @NUM2, @NUM4 provide reliable, correct information. Those two statistics annihilate the question of safety and reliability that some users come to ponder. That goes to show that the computer's negative aspects can be eliminate, leaving only the positives to remain. In conclusion, computers have a far more positive influence on users than negatives. Computers are the future, and have even proven to save lives. Why wouldn't somebody want to save the life of another? Also, the benefits of @CAPS3, or personal computers, are too large and helpful to pass up.

1092,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, Are you always telling your kids to do their homework and get off the computer? Well, I might just be able to help. Computers do not benefit our society today. People are spending to much time on them; not enjoying the outdoors, and are taking away time to spend with friends and family. I believe having a limit each day on your computer might help solve these problems. The computers can be very distracting and you can use them too offten. Stairing at the computer screen can damage your eyes and kill brain cells. Thats one thing kids and adults dont notice. You need your brain cells for school. Joins and other activities, computers can also distract you from completing work, and then you have to stay up late to finish homework should come before the computer. Time flys by as your clicking and typing. The next thing you know as it's ten o'clock and your work is not completed. Since my schedule is so busy after school. I try to complete my work, then go to the computer before dance. This way I am my friends and relax. Taking time away from the computer is a smart idea. As it comes to @DATE1 time the weather is going to be beautiful and you don't want to waste a pretty day on the computer, @CAPS5 human body needs oxygen. Clearly, computers don't supply that. A great way to recieve oxygen is going outside for some exersize and energy. Playing outside can offer a lot more than a computer. You can swim, jump, or play sports. My doctor once told me, "" Everyone should have atleast an hour of exersize a day. ""You can't accomplish that by sitting at your computer. Next time there is sunshine out, no matter what season it is, go outside and take a break from electronics. Spending time with family and friends is a fun way to stay off the computer. Friends and Family are not people to take advantage of. They are people who are there for you when you are down and make you laugh. When your relatives come to town that you havn't seen in a while, You don't want to spend it on the computer. Talking and catching up with one another is a great way to re-connect. During family holidays, we don't bring our computers. We shut them off to spend time with each other. Friends and family are special gifts. So, don't throw away friendships or relationships with your family. Get away from the computer and bond. (did not finish)",5,5,1
440,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people because, you could get obsessed with the computer. You could get in trouble, and it could effect your education. One reason I think that being on the computer too long is bad for people is because you could get obsessed with it. For example, if you were playing outside on a nice day and you called a friend and asked them to come over and they said no I can't @CAPS3 on the computer. You said why todays a nice day. Then your friend said @CAPS3 playing games. Thats an example of being obsessed with a computer. Another reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because you could get in trouble. Getting in trouble online is bad because you could get sued or the owner of the website could delete it from your computer. Also if your parents found out you would be in even more trouble because then you would get grounded. That means you wouldnt be able to use the computer for a long time. My last reason that being on the computer too long is bad for you is because it could effect your education. If someone was on the computer too long instead of doing their homework that could effect their grades a lot. If you are in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and this happens you wouldnt be alowd to graduate and go to college. That is not a good thing if you are trying to get into a good college. Even though the computers is important in @CAPS5 @CAPS6 you still shouldn't be on it to long. In conclusion everything I have said about why being on the computer too long is bad for you proves that too much computer is bad for people.",4,4,0

Many people will want to watch funny videos or thier favorite @CAPS1 show on the internet. of the most popular website for watching videos on you tube. Another great source of entertainment are video games. People buy video games at their or play them on websites like @CAPS2 you can see entertainment on the computer has a much more compared to the @CAPS1 were @CAPS2 program is shown at a certain time instead of when ever you want. Another benefit computers bring to society is acess to dailt uses, the internet provids that can tell you your local weather.

Also should be socializing with friend. Now my second reason is spending time with your fromily. Being with your family is important because their fun go out with. Also they're good to socialize with at home or any other place. Sometimes socializing with people on a computer is not good as if with people because socialicing with friends and family is easier than sitting on a chair typing a bunch of works explaining about the convosation your having. And last my finall reason is being active. People should be active because it's fun and your socialicing with people and playing sports with or . It keeps you and healthy. Also being active can healthen your lungs and heart. For example football keeps your legs strong and built. And basketball keeps you quick and always running.

1182,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I believe computers and excelling technology benefits society because it can help with hand eye coordination, it will be an easy way to learn about faraway places and cultures, and your able to save and use your time more wisely. First of all every person needs hand-eye coordination, if you didn't you would either thore a ball in the comlplete other direction or you'll get hit in the face with it. Computers benefit childrens education too, they can help you discover and learn about far away places. For example if a student is studying @PERSON3 @LOCATION1 in their @CAPS2 @CAPS3 class, @PERSON1 in @CAPS4 class or maybe @PERSON2 in music class, instead of pulling out the old, dustty biography book it would be easier to look them up on a search engine. Lastly the computer benefits everyday working or stay at home parents because if you have to get in contact with a cetain person or business quickly you don't have to take the chance of having to go look in the phone book and the person or business isn't in it, just go to to @NUM1.com type in a last name or business name, so your all set. Also if your child is being a nuisance screaming and running around the house you can just set them up with an educational game so you can get your house-hold chores finished. Those are three of the most important reasons why I think computers benefit society. They are hand-eye coordination, learning techniques and saving everyday people time.",4,3,0
1379,"Dear @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 has come to my attention that more and more people are using computers for excessive amounts of time a recent study confirmed this reporting that ""@PERCENT1 of @LOCATION2's population uses a computer for more than @NUM1 hours a day"". That means people have less time to exercise, enjoy nature and socialize. I consider that the benefits of computers are greatly outwayed by the problems that arise from them to up, computers limit a person's health-both physical and social - and do more harm than good to siciety. Spending too much time on computers can deteriavate a person's health by preventing them from spending that time exercising take for example @LOCATION3, who goes on computer at least five times a week, for about four hours. @LOCATION3 has stopped playing soccer and because she prefers to spend time on facebook. Instead of recieving six hours of exercise a week. she now recieves an hour this has to @LOCATION3 gaining weight and losing health. The problem is there are millions of children like @LOCATION3 who are not getting enough exercise instead opting. to spend too much time on their computers. Another problem is that people spend less time enjoying nature. Now, they choose to surf the web instead. This nads to people caring less about our planet and animals. Nature is very important and can be extremely fun, so this is a shame. Furthermore, those who choose to spend overwhelming amounts of time on computers tend to interact less with family members. No longer do most children help cook, clean, do chones, or spend time with siblings. One mother says ""ever since my daughter got her new laptop, she hasn't gone once to play with her baby brother or friends"" unfortunatly the same is true for most teens today computers have limited nou, much time families spend together. In conclusion, computers do harm to society they keep people cooped up in their rooms, istead of exercising, enjoying nature, or having fun with their families and friends. In doing so, computers have become a mause to society. Therefore, @CAPS1 is crucial that people who spend more than an hour a day on computers use that time to exercise or socialize, even to do nothing at all would be better overall, computers are no longer beneficiery to society.",5,5,1

Almost @PERCENT2 of teens get kidnapped because od giving their @CAPS3 a way to stranger and @PERCENT3 of those teens don't get found. The @CAPS5 is also a place of where a child or teen @MONTH1 get cyber bullied.

For children who are old enough to use / work a computer, they'@CAPS1 be inside on that nice day.

Such as good hand-eye coordination, ability to learn about far away places and people as well as being able to talk online with family and friends. Did you know that teenagers who use computers often when compared to those who don't, have increased test scores? This is because they are able to look so definitions faster, research and learn about anything they need at their fingertips. Furthermore, families and friends that live across the country are able to keep in touch due to email, video chats and facebook. It is fascinating to realize that use of the computer can increase your hand eye coordination. You are probably wandering how this is and think that I am insane but there are legitimate reasons. Since I play basketball, volleyball and softball, hand eye coordination is extremely important. One cold, wintery @DATE1 @TIME1. I was working on a long history paper and @CAPS1 essay, which meant countless hours on the computer typing. At five o'clock off I went to my basketball grow, @CAPS2 the best game of my life was playerl. Then, a week later, we had another game but this time I went straight from church. Consequently, I did not play as well; missed a lot of passes and shots. This proved to me that things use of computers, my hand-eye coordination improved. Can you imagine being able to learn about people in faraway places, their cultures, ethicities and relgion? Well now this is more than possible through the advances in technology.

For example, looking at a bright computer screan for more than @NUM1 min at a time is extremely bad for your eyes. The brightness damages your eyes and can lead to severe loss of vision.

With online chatting you can't know what the other person is feeling like, @PERSON1, or if you are even talking to other person you think you're talking to. It is much better to interact with people in person, face to face. To have good social health you need to hang out with friends, and laugh, and have a good time, not sit in a dark room and talk with online friends. @PERSON1, people need to interact with real people. Furthermore, computers can be very distracting to many people.

In my opinion computers do not have a good effect. The reason I think that is because kids are on the computer instead of doing their homework, people do not exercise as much because they are always on the computer and they do not spend as much time with their family and friends, @CAPS2 are many kids that go on the computer all night and never get to doing their homework. I read an article that said, ""Computers are the number one problem for kids not doing their homework."" People get @CAPS4 distracted on the computer that they never end up doing anything else. Eight out of ten kids say that they sometimes don't do their homework because they get distracted on the computer.

That is really the only reason we don't do @CAPS1."" @CAPS4 computers are not a very good electronic if kids are not getting their homework done because of @CAPS1. But that is not the only bad thing about them. Since people are always on computers they don't get out and exercise as much. Instead they sit and play games on a computer. I found this quote in an article I was reading ""@CAPS5 since I started spending a lot of time on the computer I have gained weight because I am not out exercising,"" Exercising and going outside is a very important things to do but people cannot do @CAPS1 if they are always on the computer. Nine out of ten people say that @CAPS5 since they started going on the computer a lot, they have not gone outside or exercised in a while.

People get @CAPS4 distracted on computers that they never go outside to exercise anymore. @CAPS2 are still some reasons why computers are not very good. Spending time with your family and friends is a very important thing to do, but with computers people to not do @CAPS1 that much anymore. In a magazine I read @CAPS1 said, ""People are not spending time with their friends and family because they are on the computer instant messaging."" Computers are keeping people from spending time together. Nine out of ten families say that they have realized they don't spent as much time together because of computers.

924,"Dear Newspaper, Some people are asking others about the effects computers have on other people. Some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computer and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. But my opinion is that the comuter is great and it does not keep people away from other activitys. First, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys because, there are @NUM1 hours in a day, and it's that persons folt if they don't get off the computer, and go do other activitys. Even though the computer has lots of things, and it is very interesting. people. Should still have the common since to get off nad go do other things, so I think it's there fult if they don't get off the computer. Also there are a lot of reasns that people don't get out and do other activitys, so why just stop computers. Secondly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because there are lots of destration that keep people away from other activitys, so why blame computers. For example the television keeps people from doing other activitys, but their not talking about stop that. Also the computer teaches you about a lot of thngs, an can so you a lot of things that you don't know about and is trying to find out. For example your family's history, you could go look that up on the computer. Lastly, the computer does not keep people away from other activitys, because if people were really worried about there other activitys then they would get off the computer and go do what they had to do. For example if they had to go to the gym then they should get off the computer, and go to the gym because the computer does not make you fat, you make yourself fat, so the should be resonable enough to go to the gym, and not be on the computer all day. Also if you were going to spend time with your family the how could the computer stop you from doing that, you should already know what you need to do and I don't think the computer would make you forget things like that. So it would be the person's fult if they forget not the computers. To rap this up, computers does not keep people away from other activitys, because it's there responablity to remeber what they need to do not the computers and there are lots more destrations then computers, but it's still not computer's falty it your's.",4,4,0
728,"Dear local newspaper did you know that the average person spends @NUM1 hours and @NUM2 minutes a day on the computer? This is why I think that people are spending ton much time on computers. If people spent less time on computers they would exersice more, be outdoors more and spend more time with their family and freind. If people were to spend less time out computers than they would exersize more. With the growingproblem of obesity in @ORGANIZATION2 less time on computers would help this. Tests show that the less time spent on computers the more time spent exersizing. And with @PERCENT1 of @LOCATION1 obese this world help that problem alot. I once had a freind who would allways be outside exersie and playing. Then he got a @CAPS1 acount and he started to be home on the computer all day and would never be exersizing. Less time on computers would also time outdoors. Result from a I took at my school say tahat @PERCENT2 people would go outside if they couldn't use their computer.

198,"Dear Local Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 show that @PERCENT1 of humans in the @LOCATION2 alone spend most of their time on a computer or laptop. I believe that the effect of computers has a negative effect on humans because it creates people to have a lack in exercise and it limits the physical interaction with others. As a nation, we can lower the statistic above and create a better environment altogether. The amount of people that lack a sufficient quantity of exercise has risen in the past decade. Doctor @PERSON1, who is expert in the connections between health and computers, surveyed @NUM1 people. Out of those people, @PERCENT2 said they rarely go outside because theu are trapped in the cyber world. This shocking percent proves that only one in twenty people actually get some tyoe of exercise. @PERSON2 stated, ""this shocking @CAPS2 means that most -if not all- all people are unhealthy physically, which is a problem that must be solved."" @CAPS3 goes on to say that being on a computer for most of the day and not exercising is what contributes ti unhealthiness. In addition to lacking exercise, many humans are losing the physical interaction that they should have. As humans have become, modernized with technology, most humans lose the physical interaction that they world normally have encountered if they we not on the computer. @PERSON3 agreed with this statement and said, "" I am a college greaduate; I have a degree and all, but I wasn't always like this. When I was younger, I owned a computer. As soon as I got home from school, I would always go on the computer. I wouldn't talk to anyone-not even my family! If I could go back and change that, I would."" This statement proves that the lack of physical interaction with human is a crucial subject to touch on. @PERSON3 regreted it all and changed his ways once @CAPS3 got to high school. No one wants to live with regrets, so physical human interactions are necessary to live a non-regretful life. the lack of human interaction and lack of exercise are problems that need to be solved as soon as possible. In conclusion, using computers has started a growing epidemin in the @LOCATION1. The most important reasons as to why computers have anegative effect on humans are it limits the amount of exercise, and it almost destroys the physical interactions between humans. Thank you for your attention, and remeber one thing: Computers can always have a negative effect on many humans lives.",5,5,1
824,"Dear editor, I hear you are looking for your citizens opinion in if computers are bad or good. @CAPS1 opinion is computers are bad. I think computers are bad in three ways and I want to express them to your and hopefully persuade you into going towards @CAPS1 side. Smell nice out to day. I can smell flowers, the grass, and many more, @CAPS1 first reason why computers are bad is if you use the computer to much you don't see enough of enjoying nature. Nature is beautiful, it has @CAPS2, green grass, rainbows (sometimes). You can make a walk of in the moons and just be yourself and be by yourself. In other words nature is very nice and you should set out and enjoy it. If you don't enjoy nature it might be no late, because soon it become and rainy and then, yes fem has flabberlasting colors, but what comes after fall, winter. Winter is not nice, it is cold. You work, because you need to shovel the drive way and your car off and that can get very tire some. The goof of is you can get those chorse. Oh not that make me to. @CAPS1 next reason why computers are bad. When was a good smile run. @CAPS1 next reason why I think computers are bad is spend all working and no time exersing. Excersing is a very fun thing to do, you fel to go outside. Hang with friends, any many shore. Exercise is a main way of staying healthy. don't you can really get unhealthy, and sick and his dies, die i have a friend whom nothing use. The computer his body rest weaker and weaker so exercise ias am main piece of staing healthy. there are many ways to health you can bike, run, walk, rog canate, climb a mountain, etc. The posibilitys are endless while exercesing in the park you never knew you can meet. car's fast say your friend, ""yo sup man,"" ""not, you"" ""not much, just fiding around for some exercise"" ""same here, same here"" see you never know who you can meet in the park now that was @CAPS1 friend. he is alwasys here, out how as you think, yep in the same park. I wouldn't have met him if i was insine on the computer. Like i said be what was @CAPS1 friend. But since I come here every day i can meet a new friend every day maybe. So @CAPS1 last reason why I think the computer is bad is because you don't get enough interacting time with friends and family. I love @CAPS1 family but I interact with them. If they are exercising who if i am here on the computer. no one can. In conclusion I think the computer are bad because you can not get enought time exercising, enjoying nature, and spending @CAPS3 time with family and friends.",4,5,0

1089,"Dear @CAPS1, I have same questions for you and I was hoping you could answer them. I was wandering. Do you have any computers in your house, if so how many? Also, do you like using the computer? I am trying to figure out how many people don't use computers because. I want to ask them how do they survive without one!? Computers are essential to our present day lives. Everything in the world is in one computer. You can talk, email, even see people through a computer because now adays everyone has a videcam hooked onto their computer. I want to tell you all of the great things computers do not make our lives so much easier. People are always looking for a way to get in touch with someone like if your phone is dead, how are you going to tell your friend what time your going to meet at that place? You can easily just text her from the computer. You can either use your screen-name to text someone or just go on verizon, at&t, sprine... etc.com and text people from there. It would save you from standing your friend up and feeling guilty about it. Has there ever been a time where you needed number, but you couldn't find your telephone book? It sure has happened to me, but you know what I do? I go on the computer and go on yellow pages.com and just look up the restraunt/place on the website. It's as simple as that. You can look up almost anything on the computer, prices, places, facts, anything! Most of the time the true facts will always be there. Computers help you a lot if you need help on histicoral, scientific, and @CAPS2 facts. Computers help us everyday. People need them for communication, telephone numbers, or facts about anything. Most of someones life can be saved to the computer. If you have bad handwriting, then you could just type up your paper and hand it in all nice and neat.

Maybe you want to go on vaction to another country and can't decide which country to go to you can go on the computer and look up tourist attractions in those countrys to decide which are you want to go to. If you are on vaction or live in a different place from you and want to see them you can video chat with them over the computer.

There is also less and less face-to-face interactions with family and friends. Another huge issue is cyber bulling. These are all problems that should be addressed. With all the time spend on a computer in a stuffy, dark room, how will our bodies be maintained properly? Exercise is a key ingriedient to healthy living. It is like trying to make bread without flour, without that necessity the bread will not rise its full potential. It is the same with the health and functions at our bodies. Exercise must be took part in to burn fat and calories, but it is also needed to build and maintain muscles.

1124,"Dear @PERSON2 - @CAPS1, I strongly suggest that people do not spend as much time on computers as they do comently. People will be doing much better things, such as exercising or spending more time with family and friends. Both these things are better for people's body and mind, and one more useful later in life. Please consider the following about why it will be more beneficial @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on computers. First, exercising is an exellent alternative to sitting at a computer screen. A recent study by @ORGANIZATION3 and the @ORGANIZATION1 studies found that an average person spent five hours per day on the computer. By cutting out at least some @ORGANIZATION1 these hours, people will be able to make time for more exercise in their daily routine. Also, @PERSON3 at @ORGANIZATION4 says that ""@PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 people do not exercise enough in the @LOCATION1 alone."" @CAPS2 some free time being on the computer is taken away, people will reward themself by taking care @ORGANIZATION1 their bodies. Moreover, I tried not using my computer for a week, and it was a great experience because in that free time I learned how to do a back flip in gymnastics. There are so many possibilities in exercising @CAPS2 people do not use their computer as much. Second, @CAPS2 people do not spend as much time on the computer, they get more experience with social skills. For example, @PERSON1 at @ORGANIZATION5 says ""@CAPS2 people spend time with family and friends, they gain necessary social skills for later in life."" A study at @ORGANIZATION2 showed that people who spend three hours or less on their computers have up to @PERCENT2 better social, verbal, and quick-thinking skills. Spending time with people's family and friends in stead @ORGANIZATION1 on the computer is exremely beneficial. I try to spend at least three hours a day spending time with family and friends and I have good relationships with them. Clearly, it is better to spend less time on the computer, and more time exercising or spending time with family and friends. Some people @MONTH1 say people can talk to people online so this is social skills, but in fact people gain better social skills from person-to-person interactions because they must use quick thinking and their emotions too. Altogether, I strongly believe spending less time on the computer is the best way to stay heathy mentally and physically. Thank you for considering my opinion.",5,4,1

To begin with, many people spend to much time on a computer instead of being outside or execising. This effect on people is something we need to start controlling because many people are very overweight and do not exercise enough to be healthy. Because so many are at an weight it is costing tax payers millions. For example, @CAPS2 @PERSON1 talking about healthcare, and anc easy sollution to cut the cost down is to have people exercise.

For example, @NUM3 year old @CAPS1 used to go to the gym everyday before she got her own computer. Now every afternoon she finds herself in front of the computer monitor. If it wasn't for computers, I'm sure kids would be outside getting exersize. Computers are a serious issue. Have you ever found yourself in front of the computer screen, on a beautiful day outside? I have, and while I was on the computer I could have been outside enjoying nature. I think it would be best if you unplugged those computers for a day and just went outside and got some fresh air! If everybody keeps this habit of staying on your computers all day and not going outside, we might turn into a world of couch potatos! Im sure you dont want that. Lastly, I remember multiple times I said I would do something with my dad but I didnt because I was on the computer. Many people can agree with me. Instead of going out to interact with your friends many are just instant messaging them. The internet is amazing, but I think everyone forgot the joy of going out with friends and family. So get off those computers and call a friend. In conclusion, the effects of computers are bad. Many people are spending too much time on their computers and have less time exersising. They are on so much they dont enjoy nature anymore. Also, they aren't interacting with friends and family. I think after reading this you can see computers arent good.",4,4,0

Having computers definatly benifits for all students. Sometimes kids forget their text books at school. But if they have a computer, they can just google the information. That way they get there homework done, and don't have to take a zero. Another thing is, I am sure you have heard of a website called, study island. If you havn't, i'ts a website for all the students in the @LOCATION1 to take online courses for math, reading, and science. They are time consuming, but they count for a huge chunk of our grade. So, if we get an @CAPS2 on study island we get an @CAPS2 in one of our classes.. Not only does the computer help students but it helps me in a kind of personal way. I love the piano. But, there are no instructions in my area. However, there is a program on the computer called synewnisia. It helps you learn all kinds of songs on your keyboard or piano. The piano helps my hand-eye coordination as well as it teaches discipline and dedication. Now, synewnesia isn't the only free instrument learning program. There are many others! This helps people who can't afford lessons, and learning an instrument can help you acheive things later in life. Now, one thing you said in your article is that people aren't getting enough exercise because of sitting in front of a computer all day. This is not completly true. In fact, most people go on the computer researching diet plans or local gyms. How do I know this? Well one day when I went on google the top search of the day was, ""weight watchers diet plan"". Also, my mom uses an online video workout website, for her bad back. So not only does the computer help for diets, they can help physical therapy also. So with this letter I hope you realize that the computer does benifite our society, yes, we should not spend too much time on it. But, online learning sessions can be time consuming. It helps many people figure out the right deit and workouts so they can stay happy and healthy.",5,5,1
452,"Should there be computers in are society. Yes, there should computer are good things and are good help. I can give you @NUM1 good reasons why. Paying bills, facebook, and research. This is why computers are good.

My second reason why we need computers is because people have facebook. And thats a good way to talk to friends, and get new friends and its fun to have facebook and just interact with people and why computers are good in society. My thrid reason why we should have computers in are society is because research and need to get info from and an computer is really good help for that, there great help for research like an specific topic the computer has all that.

You can do lots of things on the computer like an acidemic work, talk on the enernet, or even find out facts' about fam'us people you love, people computer. I think computer can benfit socity becuse computers can help you with your acidimic work, and can also talk to you friends online. One way i can benfit from using the computer by, typing my school work. But when in not doing my school work talking to my friends online. But the best thing of all is finding out information about famuse people like @PERSON1. I rember when is was doing a project on the computer and got a @NUM1 on it becuse i used the computer. That should prove that computers are very help full. Have you ever wondered how a computer can help you in your ever day life. If you said no i can tell you how. You can learn about diffrent places and food. Lets say i was going to make pizza and i did not know how i would have to look on the computer how to. A professor from virgin new york tech school said that with out computers the world is nothing. @PERCENT1 of people at new york tech school agreed but @PERCENT2 did not could you immagin a world with out computers. I if the world did not have computers we would not have cell phones or even t.v. Not ever on know the cell phones or computers lets face it with out computers the world would be lost like the proffser from new york tech said. Also teenagrs would be bored becuse most teenangers do not like to go out side and if we do not have computers how will adults do there work or they will have to handwrite it. Lets be honsest some adults and kids hand writing is like chicken scrach so to say. I think computer are very helpful for everyone around the world. In closing i think the hole world should keep computers becus with out computers the world is lost, to the past paper.",4,4,0

Well i think computer is better then newspaper, on news papers you could find the news, well of course but wheather, houses for sale, tv casting, jobs and others just the same way as @CAPS1 but instead it like virtual. It benefits society for certain reasons it depends. some times computerscan be a negative effects on people but it also teach people how to read, write, type, learn and other. What I about we can talk to others we can see pictures of people whom we no we can google into about things we need to no, it helps when they need to find they way around the mapquest. A negative issue with having computers with internet, certain websites that are not age able. Kids be on website thier parents dont bout, looking up with boys they meet over the @CAPS1, People dying making plans with someone the next day the person is gone missing. I think if experts take away computers must kids well be mad and upset and there will be nothing more to do but play video games and go outside and these are my opinions.",3,4,0
1074,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 have been complates about computer in are society. They say they are keeping children inside doing nothing, but really they are helping us so much! The internet is where you can resurch anything and tones of helpful ideas come up. @CAPS3, @CAPS5 helps us with hand-eye cordination. Lastly, computers alowe us to stay in touch with people who are far away. Like last year my friend went to poland and we were able to talk threw are computers! So lastly join me and help the world know that computers are good! First off I would like to say the computer is a good source of information. How would you like @CAPS5 if you still had to read scrolls from grene when you could look at on online? Not to manchin not any you need to know some thing really fast like now your stalk is befor a big meeting. Then all you have to do is simple type in what you want to know then bam! Just like that you know, and off to you meeting. Secondly, using the mouse and keys on a computer can incless your hand-eye cordination. Like my parents aways say when i'm typeing on esay, @NUM1 words per minute is a good minute. @CAPS3, out of @NUM2 kids get better hand-eye cordination after geting good on the computer. Alot of times kids have a ten of cordination, but I have a that if kids on the thing will change. Most importantly the computers and faraway like I menchind befor I stayed intouch with my polish buddy @CAPS3, a lot of people don't have cell phones so they have an @CAPS4, gmail, facebook, my space, or a twitter. All of this alows us to stay in touch and keep us up in are friends lives. This is very important because if we are social the we will get out with are friends and do stuff, wich is very important for are. In conclusion, @CAPS5 is good for are society to have computers in are lives. @CAPS5 will help us in the future, we will get good grades on project because of are sources. We will be heathy with hand eye cordination, from the mouse and keybord. Lastly we will have many friends. thes are all very important in. So keep computers!",4,4,0
1724,"Dear NewsPaper @CAPS1, Have you ever taken into consideration how much an effect technology has on our society? Well, for numerous people, computers are their lives. They help adults stay in contact with their friends. Also, it gives users usefull information about anything you can think of. Computers are a great tool to help us with our lives, they help us learn skills for later in life. People who use computers do not spend too much time on them, we need them to live a good life. For example, the internet has many websites that keep people in touch. There are countless sites and to name a few, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @ORGANIZATION1, the list goes on and on. Many adults begin to realize that childhood friends seem to fade away as time goes on. With computers, you can chat with each other all night. In @CAPS4, it is also a convienient way to contact friends if they live in different places around the @LOCATION1. Moreover, computers are chock full of information. If a family wanted to take a vacation, they could use the computer to find a place they would enjoy and book a flight there. Also, if a student needed to do a report and was not able to go to the library, he/she would be able to use the computer to get the info for the report. Lastly if someone had an ailment and didn't know it was serious enough for a visit to the doctors office, they could look it up on the internet. they also have many sites for that sole purpose such as @ORGANIZATION2. Lastly, computer users learn valuable skills that these who don't will never have. Just knowing how to work one is an important skill but there are many features computers have that will help when a job or in college. For instance, making a power point for jobs or just slideshows of a party in your back yard. In @CAPS4 , typing is a valuable skill that most jobs nowadays require. And using the computer fine tunes hand-eye coordination. Although some @MONTH1 say that staring at a screen all day isn't healthy, @CAPS5 of @CAPS6.S.A citizens say using the computer is healthy for their social lives and we should use it in moderation. Computers are amazing tools if used properly and in moderation. The time has come to tell the people computers are usefull to society. They help social lives, teach us skills and, give us information on countless topics. People need them to have an enjoyable life. So, write an article regarding the need for the use of computers @DATE1 and notify the people they are making the right decision by using them. ",5,5,1
1340,"Computers are an incredibly important part of many peoples lifestyles. They can give us wonderful facts and news that would otherwise be hard to obtain. Computers also allow people an easy way to communicate with friends and family without using a phone. Lastly computers are an incredibly useful tool for writing. One of the most beneficial parts of computers is that you can find out whats happening anywhere in the world. For instance, I could do a search engine on recent disaters and find hundreds of articles on @CAPS1 and other recent news. However you could also find out interesting facts like how many have chosen to sail around the world in the past ten years. But this is just one of the many uses a computer has. Critics @MONTH1 think that the use of computers interferes with spending time with your friends and family. But computers can actually do the opposite. There are many websites that allow you to talk safely to people. Some of those websites are facebook and chatme.com. Did you know that you can even video chat with people. It's just like youre right there with you. Incredibly, unlike calling people and using a phone using these websites is free and open to anyone. This brings me to the last point. Computers are great writing tools. They allow you to write efficiently and neatly. Also, programs liek microsoft word allow you to spell check your work. However one of the most usefull qualitus of a program like word is that it allows you to change your work and add sentences or words wherever you want. Its you can see computers are a usefull and beneficial part of society. They allow people to easily stay informed on world news. Secondly computers allow easy and safe communication between people and lastly they are usefull for writing papers such as writing prompts. I hope that by reading this, you can now see some of the many uses of computers.",4,4,0
1266,"Guess what! Do you like to use computers well I do and I think it benfits society for a couple of reasons. It is good to use to get information on things, to meet people and just to expose the internet and if you keep on reading @CAPS1 ill tell you why think that. One reason I think it benfits society because how in this lifetime you need to know what is going on in the world. So instead of you always watching the news or reading newspaper. You could go on the internet and see what is going on from the internet. Thats why I think it benfits society today. A second reason is haveing a computers poeple get to talk over the web and meet new poeple. Being able to talk online to people like faimly and your friends. That you havent seen or heard from in a long time. And you don't have thier number you will tot alk to them during they are on the internet. A third reason is haveing a computer and is always on it. You can explore the internet and get facts on poeple, things, and places that you never knew about and from you going on the internet you learn more things that tou never knew before. A fourth reason is by haveing a computer you can go to school on the internet. And you dont have to leave your house because you can go to school from there and by doing that most poeple could stay out of trouble because there not leavinf there house. Unfortunally I ahve to end this letter but has mush reasons and details I gave ou on why I think haveing a computer is a good idea. You will agree with me and why I think that.",4,4,0
1257,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you know computers are a major part of our society. Ever since the first computer they have been improved so much, that now you dont even need a keyboard. Having computers benifits our society because it allows us to learn about technology, and how to memorize when we start to type a lot. You have an opportunity to learn about things you like. And @CAPS2 a plus you can communicate with people from all over the world. Every day you learn something new! Learn a lot now, and you will be better off down the road! That's all teachers say. We'll computers do just that. Computers can teach us! The more you use a computer the more you know about it. You can learn about how it's made and the vireses it can have. The computers can also teach you in a way you might never have thought of. When you sit at a computer and type you start to memorize where certin letters, numbers and punctuation are. Now you @MONTH1 ask what about the little kids? How do they learn from computers? They sell millions of games for kids to help them learn even before pre-school. In fact @PERCENT1 of all kids who start off playing educational games before entering pre-school are ahead. How great is that? Kids and adults both go on computers. For kids when they go on computers they are doing things they enjoy. For example my brother is really into parcore. Parcore is when a bunch of people do flips, off of buildings, walls, or anything they can find. When he goes on the computer he looks up different parcore tricks he can do or learn to do. For adults they use it for work. They to, might have to look up things for a meeting they might have, or a buisness that they might have to work with. Using computers could be fun for some and work for others. But eather way they are using computers ina way that can help them down the road. Communication is one of the main reasons people use computers. There is e-mail, @CAPS3, twitter, facebook, myspace, and so much more.If you were to ask ten randum people on the street and asked them if they have a facebook @PERCENT2 of them will say yes. Communication is key when it comes to buisnesses and relationships. For relationships like family and friends having a computer to talk from if they are far away is great. Even for buisnesess using those internet communications you can communicate to people if your going to be late. Computers have been and always will be a huge part in our society. The computers help us in ways like learning communication, and work, knowing that this technology can help us suesede is great.",5,4,1
975,"Computers are a common household item these days. Due to how much computers are able to do, most people spend a lot more time on the computer than they should, and it is affecting our society. Computers can be very helpful, when trying to find information on a topic, but some people take it too far. Some people, their jobs are on computers. Others like teenager will do gaming or have instant messengers, which sometimes takes away from outside activities. Another situation with computers is that adults can get really into online gambling which is terrible for a person to do even at a casino, but now they can do it from their living room couch. Computers can also keep you in from outside, to get fresh air and sunlight. Computers are bad in someways but good in others. Sometimes computers are a pefect resource. When your history teacher assigns you a @NUM1 page essay on the civil war and you have no idea what happend in the civil war. In this case computers are good. Or your boss could tell you to find the amount of teen deaths in car accidents due to cellphones. Computers seem like a perfect resource. So far you've learned computers have their highs and lows but if computer time was limited then people would be able to do more stuff outside, or read a book. Some people might abuse computers others might not but if computer time was just limited I belive, that a lot of things would be different in our society today.",4,4,0
900,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I am aware that some people think computers have a negative affect on others, but I think it's the opposite. Computers have completely changed the world. People can save work on them, visually experience things they've never seen before, or even catch up with old buddies. In my opinion computers have a positive affect on people. With computers you can create documents, pictures, and even movies that will stay on your computer forever. How about your newspaper company? Does somebody hand write every paper that comes out? Without computers hundreds of copies of your newspaper wouldn't be able to b made every day. Not to mention, what would happen if you didn't use computers and a fire occured? All of your hard work will be turned into ash, but if it was on the computer you be able to retrieve it. You can save anything on a computer. Another reason why computers have a positive affect on people is because throught the internet you can visually experience places or things you couldn't before. If I was going to book a vacation I wouldn't just trust a book, I would wont to go on the computer so I could see pictures, videos, or hundreds of other articles I couldn't see anywhere else. This goes for anything else like furniture, instruments or even cloths. Computers offer alternative views that books don't. Not only can computers save data and give you visuals, but they give you an oportunity to catch up with old friends, relatives, or even meet new people! Instead of endlessly searching through phone books you can just type in their name and you bound to find somewhere on the internet. Popular websites like @CAPS1 make this extremely easy. When my dad was in search of his childhood friend he typed his name on @CAPS1 and ended up calling him @NUM1 minutes later! That wouldn't have been possible without computers. Computers truley do have a positive affect on people everywhere without them many things today wouldn't be possible. Hopefully others will agree with me too.",5,5,1
389,"Dear newspaper, I've read your article about peoples opinion on the affects of computers. I believe that having computers are a very good thing. With them we can talk to others from far away, and fast. You can learn a lot too. It also teaches hand-eye coordination. My first reason why they are good is because you ran talk to others. Without computers it would be almost impossible to meet people from far away and talk to them so easily. They even have webcams so you can see each other. You can use @CAPS1, @CAPS2, webcams, or even a simple comment on facebook or myspace. @CAPS2 or webcams are the quichest and maybe even coolest way. Secondly you can learn Computers have so many websites that give out alot of information and resent too. It's muchn easier to get on the internet and type something in then look threw a bunch of books.The internet has dictionaries, news stations, weather, history and where you can find things. With all that you dont even need books. They even have maps and you can print out directions. My final reason is because it teaches hand-eye coordination. When you first start using computers your normally pretty young, and sometimes you don't always type the fastest. Computers have become so advanced that there are even touch-screen and wireless mases. So when you first start you normaly look down to see what your writing, later, adults want you to look at the screen when that becames easy you know that your hand-eye coordination has grown alot better then when you stated. In conclusion I think that computers are a good part of everyday life and that there not bad. They are an easy communication between people, help you learn, and teach good and fast hand-eye coordination in kids.",4,4,0
1255,"Dear Newspaper, I read an article in the paper @DATE1 debating whether or not computers have a positive or negative effect on people. Even though, I love my computer, I know that computers can have a bad effect on people. Computers can cause people to have a lack of exercise, lack of family and friend time, and lack of enjoying nature. Although, computers can help people in so many ways, they can also make things worse for people. In @LOCATION1 the obesity rate has reached an all time high of @PERCENT1. A computer is a non active activity, so if you do use it you get no exersise. One time I played on the computer for two whole hours and gained two pounds. Your health is also very important. When you become overweight you get the risk of diabettes, high colestral, heart failure, liver failure, and more. My uncle is overweight and was just diagnosed with diabettes and now he regrets all the time he gave to his computer. Lastly, people @MONTH1 say that computers create great hand-eye coordination. Computers might do that but is the hand-eye coordination ever used? No, because that person is too busy playing on the computer can you see how computers can effect your health? Eighty eight percent of @CAPS1 voted that the most important thing in their life was their family and friends. The other twelve percent said that their computer or cell phone is their most important thing in life because they cannot live without it. Not spending time with your Family and friends is an awful thing to do. When my mom lost contact with one of new friends, @CAPS2 regretted not spending so much time with them. Also, if you do not spend time with people it could lead to socializing problems. If the only thing you do is talk to people on the computer you develope speech problems. My neibor, who I have never talked too never really came out of his house he always seemed to be on his computer, and no one over. One day someone came over and they started talking outside. When I overheard a little of their conversation I could the words he had trouble saying and he did not have a good vocabulary. Lastly, you can also develope relationship problems. Not being able to see a real relationship. That is why computers can have a negative effect on not only you, but your family and friends too. In our daily lives we observe nature, and it's beauty. Spending time on the computer instead of enjoying nature is awful. For example, if I was to not go outside for a whole day, and I got to spend my time on the computer I would be miserable. Nature is a gift that should be given to everybody. Also the @CAPS3 air is good for your body. Without @CAPS3 air you would be taking in chemically changed air, which is not good for your body. Lastly, everyone reads on the internet about @CAPS4 warming but why do we not take action! If you spend your time on the computer you would not be able to help nature. I remember when I read about @CAPS4 warming on the computer. So I took action and cleaned our lakes. That is why computers have a negative effect on people. Computers can be great in so many ways but it is how much time you give to your computer that is bad.That is why computers have a negative effect on our society.",6,5,1
120,"Dear @CAPS1: The effects that computers have on me is that it teaches me hand-eye coordination. I learn stuff from the computer, and it is a fun thing to go on. But, I mean those are only my opinions. Well im gonna just go ahead and explain them to you. The good thing about computers is that it teaches you hand-eye coordination which helps you see better with your eyes. Also it helps you with your hands by making you learn how to catch stuff and how to react quickly with your hands. For example I was playing baseball and I couldn't catch very good and I was also learning how to use the computer and because I was able to type fast my hands reacted when I got grounders and pop fly's hit to me. So I was so happy that I lerned how to use the computer and type. But for sure the computer is the best because you can research stuff and you find out more important facts. Also you are learnen more when ever you research anything. I'll tell you one thing though, I like the computer so much because it helps me find out important details and facts about the person that I am doing my project on. Yes I know the computer is so fun because you can go on different websites such as myspace.com, youtube.com, and funnyjunk.com. I go on mspace to talk to my friends and to meet new people that's what I like about myspace I meet new people and make new friends. I go on youtube because I like to listen to music and I watch music videos on their also I watch skate board videos too cause I love to skate! But one thing for sure is that I go on funnyjunk.com to play games cause they have so much fun games that you can play. But my favorite game is @CAPS2 the hedgehog. In conclusion those are @NUM1 opinions and @NUM1 reasons to support the effects about computers. So I want you to think about some effects about computers and your opinions about computers and compare them to my opinions? But hey! That's up to you only if you want to.",4,4,0
903,"Dear Local Newspaper, I believe that people should stay with computers. I have three reasons for this issue and they are @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3. I think these reasons woul'd be a good for this issue because every human being can do these three this on a computer. One of the reasons why I think people should stay to computers is because they can learn. People can learn by using computers because if a child is in something like animals. They can go on the internet and look up what they need to find children can also learn on the computer by putting their jump stat first grade give in the drive. children can learn like this. My second reason why people should use stay to computers us @CAPS2. I think @CAPS2 because you can talk to your friends about. They can also talk about if they want to go some fun. For example same good exercise. Another reason why I think @CAPS2 is if your friend is explaining something to you, that your. I also think @CAPS2 can be had for other to a and. The last reason why I believe people should stick to computer is because people can discover different things on there these things can be had and some can be good. For example a good thing that I can discover is that if there is something wrong with my computer and I figure out how to fix this that would be good. And I will know about computers and man what to do. A bad thing about @CAPS3 the computer I can do is bringing up a virus. That know matter what I do I can't make it go away and the computer ends up being broken. Conclusion, Local newspaper this is why I believe that we should keep our computers. Because many people even young children can learn and they will end up remembering the things that they learn.",4,4,0
159,"Imagine standing outside, the warm sun dancing on your back, jumping into the pool and feeling the cool water flow around you. But no, that won't happen. Because children and their parents are spending way to much time on their computers. People aren't getting enough excercise, it can be very dangerous and families are spending less time with each other without computers, so its worse with them. I think people need to realize that computers are over the humans. Humans especially children, need exercise. But with computers that isn't really possible. More and more children are becoming obese by the year. Computers are making that happen quicker. Instead of sitting at the computer eating potato chips, children should be outside on their bikes, or swimming, or playing sports with their friends. If it is winter, the least kids could do is go sledding. Children need to expirience nature, not the screen of a computer. The computer can also be very dangerous. @NUM1 year olds are making facebooks! You can find @NUM2 year old on the internet now. Naive teenagers go find ""friends"" in chatrooms or on @CAPS2, and their ""friends"" lie to them, about their age, another indentity. Many teenagers go and meet someone they met online and end up getting raped or killed. There are many sick people in the world, and many of them use the internet to find people. Lots of teenagers give out personal information like their last name, cellphone number, or where they live, and thats an easy way for predators to find them. It puts them, and their whole family in danger. Computers are breaking up families, and friends. Things like @CAPS1, @CAPS2,@CAPS3, farmpring, @CAPS4, etc. are turning people against each other. Some families even eat dinner at the computer. When friends go over other friend's houses, they just sit on the computer. Why is it so fun to just look at the computer screen? Families need to do something together like eat dinner together, go out for ice cream, go shopping, something, anything but going on the computer all day. I'll admit, I am a little addicted to the computer. But I don't go on it @NUM3, like some people. Instead of eating dinner at the computer, go out to dinner as a family. Instead of online shopping, go shopping with your friends. It isn't hard to at back @NUM4 or @NUM5 hours of going on the computer. Am I the only teenager who thinks this? Maybe. But I know that I am benefitting myself by cutting back on the computer. We don't get enough exercise, it can become really dangerous, and family and friends should start spending more time together. Computers can do everything more than humans can, and we need to stop it.",5,5,1
781,"Dear @PERSON1 the editor of the @LOCATION1 citizen, @CAPS1 has been brought to my attention from some people around @LOCATION1 that computers and technology are bad for us. I have also heard that people believe in the tecnology. So, the reason why I'm writing today is about this issue is to put my beliefs out there. I believe that this new technology is effecting our daily exercising, playing outside to enjoy nature and interacting with friends and family. Now that are new technology with computers and such, people are distracted and do not want to exercise. This will effect our youth because we will be fat, unhealthy and sluggish all the time. @PERSON1 we don't want this to happen to our youth because we are the future and if this keeps up the state and country will suffer. Another reason is that its good to exercise and not be on the computer or watching @CAPS2 all the time is because @CAPS1 has been proven you have more energy and will feel happier most of the time. Computers do not do that for us at all. A poll even says that @PERCENT1 of people get headaches and feel tired after being on the computer. Exercise won't do that at all. Sence all of our new technology with @CAPS2 and other gagits people really don't go outside play around and enjoy nature anymore. I was asking my mother about this topic and she said, ""@CAPS4 these days just don't go outside anymore. I remember when I was your age and my mother would kick me outside at @NUM1 am and I wouldn't be back home until around @NUM2 pm."" I believe that this should still happen. Maybe parents should still do this with their @CAPS4 and have them run around the neigborhood with other @CAPS4. If we did this more offtine maybe @CAPS4 and adults too. will just do this naturally and will not have to relie on computers or @CAPS5 for entertainment. Don't you think this is a good idea @PERSON1? My last topic is with computers and cellphone and how we really don't interact with friends and family anymore. Now a days Friends aim, video chat or text each other instead of going and doing something with them. This isn't really healthy for us because we might not know how to talk to people in real life. Also is someone aims or texts you, you really don't know how their tone is because you are not talking to them face to face. Lastly I know familys that get hurt by technology because that is all they do. They don't put down their get off their emails and they feel like they don't see each other. This is also not a health relationship with family members. @PERSON1 I really hope I have persuade to you that technology is only ok to use sometime and not very day. Remember technology is bad because we don't exerce, play outside and enjoy nature and really don't interact with friends and family members. Thank you for your time.",5,5,1
36,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Have you ever wondered what effect computers have on people? It is a very negative effect. Computers are one of the main reasons of why kids do not exercise and become obese, it can effect students' grades, and by being on the @CAPS6, you are isolating yourself from your loved ones. First of all, more and more kids are using computers way more often than they should. The result of this, you @MONTH1 ask? Since computers are used daily, especially by young adolescents, it is likely for that child to become obese. Researches from well-known colleges, such as @ORGANIZATION2 and @LOCATION2, discovered that @PERCENT1 of kids who spend more than two hours on the @CAPS6 are obese or will become heavier when they are older. After speaking with @PERSON1, graduate from @LOCATION1, he told me that when children spend more time on the @CAPS6, they are doing nothing but staring at a bright screen that can damage their eyes, and not spending their time outside enjoying the beautiful weather. As a consequence, kids start to gain body fat from sitting on a coach staring at the @CAPS6 all day instead of exercising! My second reason of why computers are a negative effects on kids is that it can harm your grades! After I spoke with a current student at @ORGANIZATION1, she told me that the reason why her grades drop is because she is too busy on @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, etc. She does not focus on her @ORGANIZATION1 work like she should and because she doesn't, her grades go from @NUM1's to low @NUM2's. This shows that even ""A"" students are getting bad grades from being on the @CAPS6. Additionally, from being on the @CAPS6 so much and not paying attention at @ORGANIZATION1 work, it can effect your best grades on the @ORGANIZATION3's! This shows that by always going on the @CAPS6 you hurt your academic skills. My last and final reason of why computers have a negative effect on children is because it harms your social skills of being on outgoing, talkative individual! Everytime you log into that death trap device, your selfesteem becomes lower because you never talk to friends or call them. You just sit on a hard chair, looking at an electronics device that is going to take you no where in life. Also, you are pushing your loved ones away by being on @CAPS6 @NUM3. You will end up never spend time with them and you will never call your friends to see what they are up to if you keep on going on the @CAPS6. Furthermore, if your mom or dad tells you to get off your @CAPS6, you become cranky and rude to your family just becuase you want to go back on your favorite electronic device. Do you really want to act that way to your family? So, in summing up, computers are a negative effect on many young individuals, and the reasons for this are that you have less time to exercise, it harms your grades, and you are not able to be as interactive with people by being on the @CAPS6. The real question is, though, is do you think computers have a negative or positive effect on people?",5,5,1
407,"I believe computers have a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, and even allow people to talk online with other people. All these things are good so why not use computers, we need computers. Do you think computers are a positive effect or a negative effect? After you hear this you might want agree with computers have a positive effect. Computers have a positive effect in so many ways for example: school, work, talk to other, and just get information. From different websites. If we did not have computers or use them we would probably use books. We would get information from the books but not as much as we would get from the computer. We probably would not know that much if it wasn't ofr computers. The reason why computers have a positive effect is because you work your eyes and while you are typing you are exercising your hands. That proves hand-eye coordination. We learn about places we don't live in like that? Had a earthquake we went on websites for that. You get to learn how it is in a certain place you want to go on vacation for. You get to learn about famous people you do not know about so all you have to do is go on the computer and look up your celebrity. Computer is something people use to talk to people and keep in contact. Now we have @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3 and others. We use that to talk to our friend and family. Some of our family or friends live in far away places so we use the computer to talk. If you have a e-mail teachers and people at work might have to e-mail each other to handle business. You can even get work for students at school so that way the can learn more and do different activities. You can even play games on the computer. You can explore nature on the computer. I think computer is a great way to learn and talk with others. Do you want your child to learn? Do you want your child to have fun? So tell me what you think! Computers have a positive effect.",4,4,0

Computers are a great way to do reports, talk to friends & family, & also to research things you @MONTH1 have needed to know. Kids in @ORGANIZATION1 have many projects to do & most of these projects involve writing a paper.

Some of these relatives @MONTH1 live very far away or not have a phone to talk on, so you can talk to them here. Some people think '@CAPS2' is 'stupid' & can't be any good, because it takes away time for homework, but what if a @CAPS3 forgot to write down the homework? The @CAPS3 could go on '@CAPS2' & chat with a friend from @ORGANIZATION1 to get that home work. There are many search engines on the computer such as '@CAPS4 pile', '@CAPS5', or even the ever most popular '@ORGANIZATION2'. Most people use these web pages to research for papers, trips, or even just to find out random information. Many people want to go to @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1 for @CAPS6, but don't know what to do when they get there. By going on one of the search engines they would find that in @LOCATION1 they could go to the @LOCATION1 zoo. In @LOCATION2 they could go to @CAPS7 world or the @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 to learn all about @CAPS11 & how it is in a @CAPS9.

1443,"Computers have been one of technoligy's greatest advances, and yet one of society's downfall. Originally thought to spread ideas and faraway places, computers have been proven to do quick the contrary. Computers are dangerous devices, and are targeting young, wholesome kids. It is the main reason why society is today, predicting that this future generation is wobbling on an unsteady and weak foundation. These devices, the source of this mayhem, must immediately be removes from society because they take away the true benefits of life, have harmful effects on our health, and support some of the country's deadliest predators. Firstly, computers are linked with the crime of stealing the pleasures of childhood. Since @DATE1, the amount of adolescent users has shot up @PERCENT1. Amazing ly enough, @PERCENT2 of parents polled admitted that their children spend at least @NUM1 hours on the computer everyday. This takes away the pleasures or reading, exercising, spending time outside and hnging with friends and fmaily. These negative effects have an unhealthy toll on society, especially teenagers, the most frequent users. As a result diet and exercise are curtailed, raising the obesity number by @PERCENT3, and lock of ourdoor or family activities have promoted anti-social @CAPS1 this alarming rate out fufture generation @MONTH1 indeed be balancing on a cracked foundation. In addition to limiting diet and exercise, computers are also the source of yet another act. As long as the computers are plugged, they emit invisible wares of electromagnetic radiation. These waves are linked to diseases and cancers. Use of computers have to cause brain-tumors and leukemia, asw ell as brain disorder and cancers. Leukemia, when caused at a young age, is difficult to cuse and stants the child's development. Children exposed to at least @NUM2 hours a day to @ORGANIZATION1 compared to the few who spend their time outdoors are @NUM3 times as likely to develop such possibilities. The ultimate prevention to such risjs is to to the rest of such causes, computers and it completely. Lastly, computers are harmful because they also a deadly we open. As an adolescent unthinkingly says the web and chtrooms, they are at risk of atteck by thousands of children predators prowling the web. Computers contain extremely valuable and secret information, such as names, birthdates, genders and even social security numbers. With one click, acfepting a strongers inivte, the online predators hack into the child's computer and obation such valuable information. Or the predators @MONTH1 be less postive and attack directly-asking questions to the child themselves. In fact, a familiar story tells the unfortunate fare of one local @CAPS2 girl, who unknowingly chatted with an online stranger. This online predator smoothly invited her to the mall, where they moved. A couple devastating, weeks later, the girl's reamin in were found, burned, as the last deadly act the predator performed on the teen. Three for, computers are simply too dangerous, a predator's thumbbook as they search for their next victim. by removing the computer, you eliminate the threats online predators pose for your child and you as well. It is amazing to learn that technology's greates advanvcement, the computer, can unleash such harmful effects. Lack of engaging activities such as exercising and reading are stunded by the ever distracting computer its electromagnetic radiation attacks our health and lastly, it supports the acts of the thousands of cruel, sneaky online predators awaiting your child on the web. By removing the source of all these troubles, those acts can be prevented and society @MONTH1 begin to the pain for reform.",6,6,1
1226,"Dear Newspaper, I personally believe that new technology is a great thing. ThatÂ’s why I think that computers have positive effects on our society. Some of these effects include developing skills to help people for present or future, getting a better education and helping people to become more social. Computers can help people in so many ways you just have to realize it. So come and see why computers are a good choice to have and use. My first reason of why I feel computers have positive effects on people is because they can help develop skills that one has and @MONTH1 not realize. For example a teenager @MONTH1 say while typing a paper that she really likes to write. So, she @MONTH1 go on the internet start looking at different styles and maybe she could become a famous journalist. It's all from the skills she got going online and searching what she enjoys. Another situation could be that a man applies for a job and then the employer' says he has to know how to use different softwear, so he could go on the computer and look for a tutorial on that specific softwear. A computer @MONTH1 help people build skills now and for their own future. My second reason of why computers can have positive effects on people is that it can help them get a better education. Any adult who hasn't gone to college and wants to can take classes online and earn their degree way. The education is just for adults; kids can go online and research history of different places they live and want to go. The great thing about you is you can find the information fast and easy. Computers help people learn more and get a better education for themselves. My final reason of why computers have positive effects is that they help people to be more social. There are so many ways to connect with family and freinds. You can send an email to someone and wait for a reply. Or now, you can even instant message somebody and talk to them like there in the same room. There are also websites, such @CAPS1 facebook, where you can get together and talk with old friends. Computers can help everyone connect with anyone @CAPS1 you can see computers have so many positive effects on people. They can help you build social skills for now and for our future. They can also help people get a better education. Plus, it is a great way to connect with past and present friends. Hopefully you can see how a computer can have positive effects on so many people.",4,4,0

They're people who are getting addicted to to @CAPS2, such as games, websites, communication and email websites and etc. Therefore, they're people who are just plain addicted to the computer, such as @CAPS3. I know people who are addicted on @CAPS3 because, they get addicted to talking to people, and looking at other people. So they dont cooperate correctly with there school work (so they get bad grades) or they loose connection with family members and friends (so they become lonely and depressed). Then thier only friend is the computer. Also other effects on the computer is if your addicted to a website (in generaal) you can get out of shape, because your not spending enough time excersing, there is already enough people in @LOCATION1 that is obesed and it is already a add on to the problem. I read online than in @LOCATION1 is obesed. So computers are a addiction waiting to happen.

This form of bulling has happened to many and we have lost many to it. @CAPS2 bulling happens to @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids. @CAPS2 bulling is a disease and it has to be stopped, kids have commited suicide because of it.

A important ability that computers have is they are able to teach you about far away places depending on were you live. The reason people would probobility want to visit one of these places on a website would probobility be for vacational purposes. My third reason to why I feel we should keep computers is. There is a lot of websites you can join so that you can speak to your friends as long as there online. IAM, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 exc. These are all great uses for computers.

1475,"It is my opinion that computers are not completly bad for people, computers can also be good for people. For example computer allow people to communicate in seconds. From around the well, and computers open up new information to anyone. But a major advantage is that people spent so much time on the computer, that they don't get any exercise. Firstly, computers are good thing because they allow news and infirmation to get to the whole world in seconds. Very recently during the war in the @LOCATION1, news reporters were not allowed into towns and cities where a user uses being fought. Every day social messaging sites like @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 brought news to the world through cell phone videos and pictures that wouldn't have been seen by the world had it not been for computers and the internet. Secondly, computers allow people to gain knowledge in a matter of minutes on topic the sun. For example if you need information on the country in the you can finf it with a computer. If you need a recepie for an @CAPS3 desert look it up with a computer. If you would like to know what the weather will be like, you can look it up with a computer. With a computer the knowledge of the world can be found by anyone. Lastly, the leading argument against is the people don't get enough exercise because they are always on the computer. The people computers say that people will because a thier computer that will the lives these arguments can be the overwhelming of heavy computer users do get enough exercise A recent status that among the internet average grade of A or better, who also do at least With this information the argument In conclusion, computers are not completly good or completly bad for society. Their strong points are communication and the ability to gain knowledge quickly. The main downside is that a minority of computer user don't get enough exercise. It is my opinion that computers are good for and the pres definitily outway the care.",4,4,0

There is absolutely no exercise involved with being on your computer. People need to get outside and go jogging, play games or ride their bikes. Cutting back on computer time would cut back on the obesity problem in our society. Top scientists and researchers say that it is extremely important for people to interact with others face to face.

Second, You can make online job applications. Lastly, computers allow people to chat with other people. Firstly, the computer allows your children who are also students to do better on their projects and reports. They help children's reports because for example they are doing a report on ""@CAPS2 lincon"" they have access to look up the peron to get information they need right at home. Doing reports with their computer there is no need to use up your projects you can also look up information and print out pichers to make your project more vibrant and eye-catching to younger people. Also @CAPS3 allows you to type your information to make @CAPS3 look orginzed and neet. Accordly, if you are trying to find some job applications without wasting your time, just look on the internets. This way you want go to place not knowing if jobs are available and seeing none. Also @CAPS3 save your to save the trip out there. You are able to look up the paying of the job and regulations, and you can find out if you get the job fastered. Lastly, @CAPS3 allows socializing. For example like facebook or/and myspace lets you talk to friends from school or friends you met online. For adult who don't have a myspace or facebook account they can use email, msn, aol, aim/aol instant messager, or via chat.

Instant message them, and video chat with them, instead on having to face out money to make long distance calls. Theres many people out their like me. Who have friends and family far away, weather its family in different countries, old school mates and camp friends using a computer is a great way to keep in touch with one another.

Moms taking care of their kids might not be able to go to @CAPS1 & @CAPS2 with one kid not wanting to get off his video games, the other watching their favorite @CAPS3 show. Thankfully that man and go online, pick the food that she and the quantity and she can get someone to deliver it. That mother also might not be able to get out and go shopping.

418,"Dear @ORGANIZATION2, @CAPS1 name us @PERSON1 from @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2. I thought it would benefit your opinion on the effects @ORGANIZATION1 computer usage throughout the @LOCATION1 if you heard from a young teen. This would help you because at @CAPS1 age people are dependent on computers! they can be entertained by online games, communicate with friends and family and receive news about what is happening around the world. Although some people do not always benefit by having a computer, most @ORGANIZATION1 the time people are satisfied, and do benefit from the use @ORGANIZATION1 computers. First off, people are affected by computers in a positive way because they can be entertained whether it is playing online games, or participating in a fantasy sports league. Although I just mentioned two non-educational examples, there are many educatiional websites on the internet which children can learn from. In @CAPS1 personal life I can name so many examples @ORGANIZATION1 entetainment. I use such as @CAPS2, which is an online game website, or fantasy football teams I am involved in. Another example @ORGANIZATION1 entertainment is when @CAPS1 younger brother. Parker goes on leaving websites. He will play on these websites for hours. Although he is sloveling infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer screen he is learning. Also, expert say that children in the throughout the world learn more from the computer then from a textbook, or hearing information from a teacher. They say this because a computer screen catches peoples attention. Learning is a major priority and if it means putting a child infront @ORGANIZATION1 a computer for an hour will improve this, then that is what will happen. @CAPS1 next reason why effect @ORGANIZATION1 computers on people is positive, is because it helps people communicated with friends or family. @CAPS1 brother is attending college at @ORGANIZATION1 and since we do not see him often. our family will video chat with him over a program called @ORGANIZATION4. Because @ORGANIZATION1 this program we are able to stay in touch. An online poll was put out on @DATE1 which asked how people regularly talk to friends, or family. Sixty-three percent @ORGANIZATION1 the votes showed that people communicate over the computer most @ORGANIZATION1 the time. Thirty-two percent said over the phone and about sixteen percent said in person. this shows how much people communicate over the computer using, facebook, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, and much more. I would say that the computer is a good effect ion people when used this way. Lastly, computers help people receive news about what is happening around the world. On the computer at @CAPS1 house, everytime I open the internet there is breaking news about the war in @LOCATION6 devistation on @LOCATION5, and much more. Alsom a few months ago a class at @ORGANIZATION3 made a pie-chart and discovered how their classmates find out world news. Fifty-six percent said they foud out their news from computers. Not only is it @ORGANIZATION3 students but most people get news from the internet. Just the other night at dinner our waiter was from @LOCATION4 and he said he received all @ORGANIZATION1 his news about his hometown from the internet. As you can see many people use the internet on their computers to receive news and information. It is easy to tell that the effect computers have on people is positive because @ORGANIZATION1 the reasons I have stated above; people can be entertained, they can communicate with family and friends, and @MONTH1 recieve news about what's happening around the world. Like I said on the first paragraph, not all the effects are positive but most @ORGANIZATION1 them are!",6,6,1

169,"Dear @LOCATION1 @CAPS1, after reading your article about advances in technology, I would like to offer my opinion about this contraversal subject. All around the world, people are using computers to do all sorts of things; weather its for games, the buying and selling of items, talking with people in different countries; the possibilites are endless. This is, however, not nessessarally a good thing. Many people become addicted to computers. Esspecialy adolesents, who enjoy the games that computers offer. From personal experience being addicted to computers, I can honestly say that I was under almost complete control by that computer. My grades started to go down, I stopped interacting with my friends and family, and trouble on things. Many parents watch their children go through this and are sometimes helpless to stop it. This poses a large problem for parents. My word of advice; don't let your children become addicted!",3,3,0
1453,"Dear local newspaper, I have recently saw that you think that people are spending way too much time on computers instead of excercising or hanging with their friends and family. Well I think the opposite of that opinion. People interact with people online if the want to. People can also learn new things. Plus computers help people make money. So read on to hear more. Most people that use computers are interacting with people someway somehow. @PERCENT1 of all people have either a facebook, a myspace, a skype, or all three. on any of those sites you interact with people. We can meet new people on the internet. Like people on the other side of the state or country. Also we hear about what is going on in our big or small town. Like for instance if there was a missing child we know the description, so we could help find him or her. Not only do people interact bu people can research useful information. For an example, one day I was told do a project on teen mothers. I went straight to the library I took some books out and whatever I couldn't find in the books. I went to the computer for. Also we can learn about faraway places like @LOCATION2 or @LOCATION1. My mom always says, ""@CAPS1 your room or @CAPS2 going to give your stuff to people in need."" @CAPS3 the first time she said that to me I went to the computer to see how other people were having to me. Some were good, nice, big houses but tyen others lived in boxes and trash cans. That changed me big time, I felt really had for those people. Lastly computers help people make money and support their family. @PERCENT2 of all people found out about their job on a computer. Theycan go to websites to find good safe jobs that makes good money. Plus if you have a computer you can easily work from home. Some people dont have the money for babysitters so have to watch their kids all day so have to work from home to make money. Finally people can apply for jobs or even community service online. My sister, @PERSON1, got her first job by going on the @CAPS4 museums website and applying right there on the computer. Therefore computers are good. I say this because people can interact with other people online, people can research useful information, and finally computers help people find jobs and make money. Do you use computers for any of these reasons?",4,5,0
1177,"I agree that computers have a bad effect on people because they will spend less time exercising. To much time on the computer takes away knowledge and takes away time with family and friends. So, please listen up so I @MONTH1 explain why I feel this way. My first reason to this situation is people will spend less time exercising which can lead to drowsiness or laziness if you stop exercising. Another reason is that it can affect your ability to run or even stand up because @PERSON1 says that, ""people who exercise a lot will be able to do work but if you don't you won't be able to do nothing."" @CAPS1 of all you'll miss out on the fun while you are to be to lazy to come. My second reason to this situation is that it takes away knowledge. For one you might forget what you learned. Seconds toturing @MONTH1 be needed because you couldn't focus. @CAPS1 you @MONTH1 even forget the people you know even where you live if you spend to much time on the computer. @CAPS1 reason to this situation is that it takes time away from your family and friends.",3,3,0
1758,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 on a beautiful sunny day, people inside on their computers instead of enjoying the weather. This is what could happen if people are using them. I believe that computers have a bad effect on people because their communication skills will drop, people won't get enough exercise & their health can be imnarred. As i mentioned, everyone who is using a computer on a daily basis, will drop their communication skills.. People enter chat rooms not knowing who they are talking to. For example, if i logged onto & chat room, someone might ask for personal information such as where you live, your phone number & your name. This could lead to things such as kidnaping & even rape. Also, interactions with family members & friends @MONTH1 decrease. You can be playing a computer game, online, or going on youtube to watch random videos of people. You tube in said to be a dangerous site for younger children. Kids could go under history to go to a website they were recently on when click the wrong one bringing them inapropiate website. Finally, teenagers and adults go onto facebook & twitter. Some @MONTH1 say these sites @MONTH1 change the social interactions, but it really isn't. Kids & adults are constantly getting addicted to it. Also telling people what you are doing every moments of your day everyday is kind of unreal. People don't need to know when you do things in your day i have keep up this our communication skills are sure to decrease. Secondly, exersice is a problem. Doctors say that @PERCENT1 of their parents are obeise or over weight according to @ORGANIZATION1. Kid just sit at home & play computer games such as sims @NUM1 & video chat with their friends instead of hanging out with them. No one really goes for walks any more either. Also, people don't go out & enjoy nature like the you. @PERSON1, a state @LOCATION1 from @LOCATION1 in @LOCATION2 said, ""each year the number of people are getting fewer & fewer. Preety soon all parks are going to have to get closed down."" @CAPS2 don't want this to happen, do you? I know i would not. Our generations are just becoming more technology enhanced. Finally, more & more people are becomeing unhealthy. A person's eye sight is most likely to drop if they are on the computer everyday. My aunt is required to use her computer everyday at work. She went to her eye doctor because her vision was become weaker. One of the first questions he aske was, do you use a computer on a daily basis? she answered yes. He said she would need cataraks eye surgery. This was all in result of using a computer. Finally, you could get althritis in your hands & fingers from typing & using the mouse all the time. Many people at the age of fourty are probaly going to need hand surgeries from all the work the do, likes! As you can see technology is harming your communication skills, exersice & you health. I bet you don't want your future generations like this. So take a part & contact your local newspaper today.",5,5,1
742,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 are not bad for society. They actually can be quite good for people. Computers allow us to talk with people online. They can help us in school and give information we need to do things in life. People think they are bad, but all you have to do is look a little deeper and you will find the good in @CAPS7. @CAPS5 people use a @CAPS2, <@PERCENT2@NUM1> of the time @CAPS7 is to talk with people on the @CAPS3, whether @CAPS7 is using video chat or e-mail. People who don't like to use @CAPS2 and e-mail @CAPS10 ""@CAPS4 not use a phone or even talk to them in person."" With e-mail, you can send a message to some one miles away. If you are sending someone a list, a recipe for example. you don't want to @CAPS10 to them over the phone. @CAPS7 would be easier to type @CAPS7 out and then send @CAPS7 to them over the e-mail. ""@CAPS5 my son said. he was going to tech me how to use e-mail, I thought @CAPS7 was going to be a waste of time,"" @CAPS6 @PERSON1, senior citizen. ""@CAPS7 tursns out, @CAPS7 wasn't. Now i use e-mail e-mail every day. Many people think email is a waste of time, but @CAPS7 can help you in your everyday life. The @CAPS3 can helps in @MONTH1 ways also. @CAPS7 can help us get information about various topics. If you are trying to cook a stir fry but you don't know what to put in @CAPS7. You try to call you mother but she isn't there. Your next choise is to look look @CAPS7 up on the @CAPS2. @CAPS7 turns out theres a website that gives a recipe for a stir fry and you follow a do make the best one even. I know for an experience that you can find maps to places on line, since i have to go some is here almost everyweek. Google map is the most used place on the @CAPS3, besides e-mail. Some newspaper have websites @CAPS11 you can read the paper without actually paying for the paper This saves you money and @CAPS7 was less paper @CAPS11 we can save trees. The huge world of the @CAPS3 can change our lives. @PERCENT1 of people that use the @CAPS2 almost everyday are students. Students use the @CAPS2 for many reasons. The biggest one is typing. Students use typing to type reports and e-mail. ""I have messy handwriting"", @CAPS10 student, @PERSON2. ""@CAPS11 if if weren't for the @CAPS2, no one would be able to read my homework and reports. Not even me"" @PERSON2 is the one of many people who are lucking that they harmy typing on the @CAPS2. Another reason students use @CAPS2 is to look up information for reports. If a student puts a bibliography in his report, you will see that he/she used the @CAPS3 @PERCENT2 of the time. There @MONTH1 not be a book in a local library for a student to use, but the @CAPS3 will have many website and blogs for him/her to use. The third reason is for help. There are many website that can help a student to use for help in any subject. The @CAPS3 can help a student pass school. A @CAPS2 can help anyone from talking to someone to helping a student with science. That is how computers are good.",5,5,1
196,"I think the use of computers is very good things in the present day @LOCATION2. I think this because people use it to research, stay in touch with friends and family, and music. These are all things adults and kids need a like to do. read on and I will explain why this is so important. My first reason why I think computers are good thing is because the are a good source to do research on a specific topic. Kids all over the @LOCATION1 use the internet to do class projects. Adults can use the computer to look up a certain food resipe. If you need help with something the computer is allways there. Some people even use the computer for a job. Computers can help with a lot of things. Another reason why computers are a big help because you can stay in touch with friends and family. A great thing to use on a computer is a web cam. With this you can see and talk to people on a lillte camray even if they are far away. You can also go on myspace of face book. Theare two websites that are used to post pictures and to talk to chosen friend. It is a good way for people to get to know you. A similar thing to this is instant messaging. You can use this to talk to friends and many on line. Don't stop reading there is more thing! My last reason why computer are sutch a great thing to have is because you can do do mutch with music on the computer. You can use the computer to listen to music, and put music on to and ipod or @NUM1 player. Some people use the computer to make music. You can get a progrem that you can make heats and put it together to make some kind of a song. music is a great thing that all age groups love. That is why I think haveing a computer is a very positive thing. You can do researching, say in touch with friends and family, and do a lot with music. There is so mutch more then thease @NUM2 thing that a computer is good for. I don't think the world would be the same without computers.",4,4,0
652,"Dear Local newspaper, I agree that computers have an effect on people. It helps people learn hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn a far places and you can talk online with other people. Computers teach hand-eye coordination. As @CAPS1 grow up, they learn about letters of the alphabet and spelling. There are many online programs that teach @CAPS1 how to type. Once the @CAPS1 get in learning how to type, they end up typing fast. Computers help @CAPS1 of future learn & with all these learning websites, @CAPS1 will be able ti teach them solves new things. Isn't it a blessing to be able to meet people from a far? You'll get ot learn there cultures. Would you want to know something about? They make daily go around, there you'll you? Well its so learning a new culture is a faster way of making friends. Have you connect. Oneday i will people who dont just want to be friends, maybe more than that. Be positive about online chatting, or online dating services. As you can see for my reasons above, the computer has an effect on people. The computer teaches you hand-eye coordination, it also gives you the ability to learn afar places & people, and it allows you to chat with other online people. Make sure you stay positive & be safe on the computers.",5,4,1
287,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Your resources, your entertainment, even your communication with people might be fading. @CAPS8 you know a large portion of people think this @PERSON2 is harming our society. Well I will say I think they don't understand these benifit that computers bring us. Computer act like teachers teaching us without us even knowing it. Hand-eye coordination is a perfect example. Plus, we use computers to learn about places we might want to travel to, or have a conversation with frinds or family living ways away tromus. Computers is an extrodarny piece or technology. First, I like to say everything that you do physically uses hand-eye coordination. Making dinner, riding a bike, driving a car etc. And unfortiunitly not @CAPS6 people are the best at hand-eye coordination. One of @CAPS7 friends, @PERSON1, had horriable hand eye coordination. So for his birthday I decided an getting him a computer. It's been @NUM1 month since his he had his computer and @CAPS8 he was trying to hit a baseball at his sons party, he moneged to hit the ball @NUM2 out of @NUM3 where he used to hit it @NUM1 or @NUM5 out of @NUM6. @PERCENT2 is a termendous increase in only @NUM1 month! Just something @CAPS8 simple @CAPS8 a computer improved @CAPS7 friends hand-eye coordination a termendous amount. Secondly, the computer can help you learn about far away places @CAPS8 the @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION4. Do you really want to travel up to the icey cold, and piercing winds of the @LOCATION1 just to learn about it? For some I'd say like that but what if you cant travel up the @LOCATION1 due to money or flying conditions. I want to be able to study about polar bears and the glaciers without needing to worry. A statics from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 of @CAPS5 states ""@PERCENT2 of people wpould love to experience the thrill and excitement of the @ORGANIZATION1 lights. But out of those @PERCENT2 only @PERCENT3 said they'd actually travel to @LOCATION2 to see them"". So you can see that @PERCENT4 of those people wouldn't go whether it be due to money or the cold. Thery @CAPS6 said thats why they love the computer. They can experience the @ORGANIZATION1 lights without needing to travel into the bitter cold.Lastly, that better thing to do on the computer than with family you've never met before or don't get to see them. The editor for the @LOCATION3 Local states ""@CAPS7 parents live over @NUM8 miles away. I rarly get to tell to them now because I can't afford to travel that distance ofter. So I use @CAPS7 computer, @CAPS7 parents and I now communicate @PERCENT1 more than we used to. I love the computer it helps keep me close to @CAPS7 loved ones."" @CAPS8 you can tell, thanks to the computer we talk @PERCENT1 more to his parents than he used to! In conclusion, the computer is a gracous device that is extremely benifital to people. The computer teaches us hand-eye coordination, lets us learn about places we other wise would never learn about, and to have conversations with friends or family that we generally dont get to see often. Now you go out and make anyone that says computers are a horrible inventions you tell them exactly why computers are so important!",6,6,1
1429,"Dear @CAPS1, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Three reasons why I think computers have a positive effect on people are that you have the ability to talk to your friends and family, also talk to other people around the world and you can even shop online. Without contact with your loved ones is sad because if you wanna talk to them you can email them to see how they are doing. With emailing you can send messages to your friends in any part of the world. One example of this is if you have a friends in @LOCATION1 and you wanna see if he's doing @CAPS2 you can send him a message. Talking to people on the web is really fun because you can se what or people are playing games with you. If you are on facebook or myspace you can add people as your friends so you can friends. Shopping online is more faster and more quicker than shopping at. is that if you shopping for clothes and there's a then you'll start to go that's why there is online shoping so that we can. You can. In conclusion is a very useful thing. talk to your relatives from @LOCATION2 and you can shopping without the waiting in line. The can talk to other the world.",3,4,0
463,"Dear local newspaper, I've heard that some people think that computers do not benefit society. But I belive they do. Computers help us learn information of al types. It's a good souce of entertainment. And last but not least, computers do not drasticly change the time we use exercising, enjoying nature and interacting with family and friends. Computer are a great resource in our everyday lives so why not use what we were given. Google, yahoo, @CAPS1 and @LOCATION1. What would we do without them. They help us figure out small things like quick and easy way to get rid of a stomache ache or a funny joke to tell at the office the next day while you in the staff room drinking coffe. They also help us when we want to know what to do when your newborn has a cough and a small sneeze you know the tough stuff. These are the kinds or things you need to know and not everyone go out to the library everytime you have a question. The information on the computers is endless why not use it from learning a new language for next vacation to @LOCATION2 to finding help for that geometry homework that you just can't understand, the computer can do it all. Entertainment is everlasting on computers from the skatebording dog on. Youtube that you can't stop laughing at to the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on addictinggames.com. There will never be a dull moment. There are millions of videos and movies on youtube. There are @CAPS4 of games on the @ORGANIZATION1 alone from pacman to scrabble there's no way we'll have nothing to do. I always go on @ORGANIZATION2 to talk to family living too far to visit. Computers are one of the best soarces of entertainment, they definetly benefit society. Computers definetly do not change the way we exercise, enjoy nature or interact with family and friends. On the computer there are videos that show us new yoga move and other ways to lose those extra pounds you gained over the days. There are sites to find where to go camping and have that family vacation you have always wanted. And we always make time to go see our family and friends. Computers dont keep us hupnitized. Without a doubt computer benifit everyone's society. They re informational. The definetly entertain us all. And then don't turn us into mindless zombies so that we can't interact with other people.

Computers help us do research they keep us connected with friends and family and they are required to be used at some @CAPS1. The internet is a easy way to do research. All you have to do is search what you want information on and millions of articles will be at the click of mouse. Using the internet on a computer is much easier than going through books looking for something. That could waste a lot of time. The internet can quickly and directly answer your questions. Computers are a great way to keep connected. Almost everyone has a email now. All you have to do is type a few letters and you'll be reaqquainted with a old friends. When you call someone you can't be sure if they are busy or not. When using email the person recieving the email can reply when they howe free time. Computers are used at many @CAPS1. Sometimes you're even required to use it. Computers organize data by keeping documents in different files computers also have valuable programs that could help you in your career. Such as @ORGANIZATION1 word. Using a computer would aid you financialy. Some of you might think computers have misleading information. The internet isnt always a honest place. By spending a few minutes double-checking your information on other websites, your still spending less time than it would take to find the fact in a book.

These are the three reasons why I think the effects of the computer are bad. The @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that computer could cause couse blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers because the screen of the computer has too much light, people can't just stop staring at the monitor and even worse they could probably lost their sight and they will end up with blindness. That's why you have to be away from the screen but, being too long on your computer is bad. This is my @CAPS1 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad because the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computers. The @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers because when people are on their computers too much time they just couldn't come down stairs talk with their family of friends, they could'nt go outside and enjoy the glory of nature and the enjoyment at the outside world, and also if they had nothing they can just read a book, draw, watch the @CAPS4, etc. They could do those things rather than wasting their time on their computers. This is my @CAPS2 reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computers. The last reason why I think the effects of the computer is bad is that people need to use their computer for a less time because when people use their computer for a less time it is good because now they finally could be with their family and friends and spend so much time with them. It also good to saving energy, and prevent you from paying alot of electrical bill, and also it is good to finally let your vision of the eyes to relax. In conclusion, the three reasons; @CAPS1, the computer could cause blindness to people when they spend too much time on their computer. @CAPS2, people need to relax their vision and do something rather than on their computer, and @CAPS3, people need to use their computers for a less time will prove that the effects of the computer I think its very bad.",4,4,0

Finally it allows people to talk online with other people. Computers make people develop hand eye coordination. When someone plays a sport live baseball or basketball, hand eye coordination is definetly needed. say your a catcher, and then catch it. Almost every sport needs hand eye coordination and computers help you get it. Hand-eye coordination can also be useful to people with jobs. If you work with computers for a job, it is helpful to be well known wit the keyboard for fast results. Mostly any job along with sports requires hand-eye coordination. Some people have the gift that they have hand-eye coordination when there born, but for people who don't practice is the best thing. Learning about faraway places/ people is always facinating.

Theres also @ORGANIZATION1. @ORGANIZATION1 can help you find any place or you can find out anything about that place.

They get so wrapped up in it that they miss out on their important daily activities. It shouldn't  that for but its became an epidemic, eveybody is being sucked into their computers! People who are on their @CAPS4 @NUM1 are away from their friends and family! they are like oh i haven't talked   his surgery i wonder how he is! Lets see! They go on and  You can talk to someone in just a click! Talking to someone  facebook or twitter is no the same as talking to them in person! Its like people think computers is     @CAPS4 take people away from their friends and family and them talk only on facebook  .When people on the @CAPS4 they become lazy! A person who is @CAPS4 addict will say "" @CAPS5 supposed to go to they gym but let me check my twitter first!"" two hours later then they go the gym! People don't exercise as often as the should! When people are going to lay on the @CAPS4 for @NUM2 minutes it takes @NUM3 hours! They have to sign in, chat with their friends, check their mail look at their tweets look at their restaurnat  check out videos on youtuve and do all other kinds of things! Computers are good but have sideeffects getting addicted, being away from friends and family, and not exercising. @CAPS4 addicts should minimize their time on the @CAPS4!",4,4,0
989,"@ORGANIZATION1, In today's age computers are seen everywhere and they have been so helpful. They act as an information highway and connect people together. The new advances in technology have had a positive effect on humans all over. First off, computers are an easy way to have a universe of information at your fingertips. @PERCENT1 of students at @ORGANIZATION2 say that when assigned or paper or project the first source they use is from the internet. The internet is fast, simple and reliable when you know how to use it."" said student @PERSON1. Children from the age of @NUM1 and up are learning how to use the internets multiple online encyclopidias, amagazines, newssites or other resources to get information. I remember my kindergarden computer class where we'd reserch dinnosaurs and weather patterns on kid friendly websites. And now being in middle school we use websites like @CAPS1 Online for up to date reliable information. Moreover, I've seen my mom, a nurse and hospital manager, use the internet for videos and articles on how to do certian procederes and ways to orginnaize a productive hospital. The internet is a great way to have a highway of information at the touch of a button. Furthermore, computers are used as a way for people to stay in touch. @PERCENT2 of teenagers say they talk to other peers using @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4 or @CAPS5. Its a great way for us to communicate with our busy schedules when we can't always get together. Also with parents losing jobs in this ecconomic downfall, kids are always moving. Last @DATE1 one of my best friends in the world moved all the way to @LOCATION1. I though we'd never talk again and I was so upset to say goodbye, but because of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 we talk non-stop and have accually never been closer. And its not just for young people to fool around with friends but adults use social network too. They connect for buissness through the internet and talk about future deals or problems and even use it to connect with old friends they haven't spoken to since college or childhood. As you can see the internet has had many positive effects from doing reserch faster to connecting with old friends, computers ar helping everyone.""",5,4,1
751,"I would like to state on my behalf that I do not agree that computers are good for society. There are three reasons why I do not agree. Many people will not enjoy the outdoors, @CAPS1 people will spend @CAPS1 there time on the computer, and a lot of people will gain wheight to inactivity. When you sit on a computer you dont get off of for a while, why, because you are haveing fun. when you are haveing fun you will not stop wat you are doing, @CAPS2 dont pay attention. Eventually you will get hooked and play on the computer rather than go outside and have fun with your friends. @CAPS4 will just take up all of your time. @CAPS2 when you are bored you find anything that you can possibly do, rather than be bored. Many people are thinking this is a good time to go on the computer but @CAPS3 you bored you will stay on the computer until you have something to do. My mother always tells me when im bored not stay home because @CAPS4 will get worse. There is always something you can do that dosn't you just have to look harder. My last reason is that when you sit at a computer and you are fingers, you gain your wheight you I read @NUM1 children in every years will be obese, not because @CAPS4 runs in the family but because of inactivity. Inacitivity means not active activity. @CAPS3 you calories you will gain weight @CAPS6 wheight is unhealthy and you can stop the problem by just finding something spend your whole life on the computer. In conclusion you @MONTH1 have mixed thaught's @CAPS3 you ever want to go on the computer all the time. @CAPS4 doesnt matter @CAPS3 you go on just dont all the time. But remember my reasons why not to spend too much time. You will not enjoy the outdoors, find something else to do when you are and you will gain wheight @CAPS3 you spend all your time on the computer. ",4,4,0
1502,"Dear local newspaper, I believe that with too much use of computer it will have bad affects on people. People can get addicted to it so easily. They also use a lot of electricity. And people sit on the computer all day and don't exercise at all. These are all bad affects computers have, but their not all bad, without them life might be a little harder. Playing computer games, and online poker sounds fun right? Wrong! People get addicted to them everyday. Online poker could be dangerous. I remember seeing a show about this guy who was addicted to it. He'd put his credit card information in and sit and play all day. Before he knew it, he was in debt. Once he was addicted it was very hard for him to stop. It's a stupid thing to get into because there is no point to it. You sit and waste money, especially with our economy the way it is. A recent study shows that @PERCENT1 of people who play online poker are addicted within two weeks. Other games are also addicting too. There's a website that called addicting. I guess people don't know the affects of being addicted to a computer has on them and their family. Did you know that @PERCENT2 of electricity in @LOCATION1 goes to computer? Thats almost half of it going to one thing. I don't think it's right that pretty much everything is done on the computer now. In our economic chrisis I don't think enery should be wasted playing computer games. We could use energy for more important things that people any need. If everyone didn't need computers to communicate and everything there wouldn't be a problem. The number of computers sold has gone up @PERCENT3 since @DATE1. I understand emailing, and facebook. But don't get out of hand with it. Isnt being outside on a beautiful day great? Wouldn't you rather enjoy that or excercise rather than sitting glued to a computer? Obesity is a huge problem in @LOCATION1. A lot of people are obese from sitting on the computer and not excercising. I remember when I was younger, everytime I went to my friends house, his dad would be sitting and playing poker and games on the computer. He was very out of shape and lazy. His parents later got a divorce because he turned into a totally different person. Most @CAPS1 are lazy. We don't like to do work if we don't have to. I would define they rather excersise or go outside instead of being on the computer. You live a lot healthier when you're not addicted to the computer. And when you're healthier, you're happier. So in conclusion, if you don't control yourself on the computer it can have bad affects. Computers are easy to get addicted to, use a lot of electricity, and can make people fat and lazy. Do you think playing computer games is worth losing friends and family?",6,4,1
379,"I believe that computers have a great effect effect on people. People all around the world use computers to talk online with other people, give people ability to learn about faraway people and places, and also let you explore the internet computers are a great influence on our lifestyle. Computers allow people from around the world to interact with friends and family. Some websites that allow you to do so are myspace, facebook, and @ORGANIZATION1. With facebook you can take a picture of yourself and place it on your web page. It is relly quite easy. Also, with @ORGANIZATION1 you can chat with your best friends and can actually see what they are doing. But if you want to do this you are going to need a webcam. I have @ORGANIZATION1 and I think that it is a wonderful resource. I have relatives in @LOCATION1 that I only get to see once a year. But with the help of my computer I can interact with them all year round. Computers can make people from faraway places learn about the culture and ways of another person's lifestyle. Have you ever seen the commercial where a little boy is talking to his father on the computer. Well, in this commercial is laying down on and is eating an @CAPS1 cookie. While he is doing this he is talking on the computer with his dad who is doing the same. At the same time both father and son dip their cokie into a glass of milk, eat it and laugh. I felt at that time that it was a wonderful moment because even though they are both in opposite directions the two are still having a great time. Just to think that it was all because of one computer. Exploring the internet is what a computer can do. When doing this you can play some really fun games on a rainy day when you are bored. You can look up what happened during one of your favorite basketball games. Such as how many points @PERSON1 got for your fantasy team. Also, at my school you can check your grades to see what you got on your last math test or quiz. For example if I had all A's but one @CAPS2 in math, then I would know that I would need to really study for my next test to get on A on it. With the help of the internet, I can do. So, now you know wh computers are a very important part of our society. Computers allow us to talk online with other people, give people the opportunity to learn about faraway people and places, and computers also allow everyone to explore the internet. As you can see now, computers are great influence to our lifestyle. ",5,4,1
38,"Dear local Newspaper, @CAPS1 in the society we live in, more and more people are using computer including me. The computor in my opinion has to be one of the best inventions ever. The bad part is that these ""exports"" think spending time on the computer is a bad idea when they fail to see the good in computers. Student can use computers to get information on almost about anything, you could use computer to talk to friend and family members, and you confuse it as a navigator to find directions to a certain location if you cant find your way or if your lost. One of the best things about computers is that you can find various amounts of information. That opition is useful for children that attend school , looking to find information for a certain project they need to finish. You can also use the information on the computer to study if your textbook isnt doing you only good. Also if a student is looking for a job in their local area they look on the internet for jobs needing employees. Computers also can be used for communication. You could have a long lost realtive you havent spoken to in a while, you can easily find him on the internet. Online communicating is also good for chatting with schoolmates if you forgot the homework or need help with homework. Im not a big fan of this but online chatting can be use for online dating if your to lazy to go out. One of my favorite options on the computer is that you can use it to navigate a certain location you want to go to. Lets just say you forgot where a relatives house is you can easily type in your address and his address and easily get directions. You can use this method for almost anywhere you want to go. If this did not convince you that that a computer is a great piece of technology, then your crazy. The computers is like a magical box that can be used for anything so I advice you get one.",4,4,0
1390,"Dear Newspaper, I think that computers have a negative impact on society. I say this because it alows kids to be bullied at all hours of the day, it takes away from their exercise, and it gives then less time to study and do school work. Overall, i think that talking is the main use for computer. But, some times it is used in the wrong way, @CAPS1. Experts say that @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 kids have thing to use to talk on line, but the also say that @NUM3 in @NUM4 of thoes kids are bullyed on line. Also every year you hear someone or them, well most of the time it is because of @CAPS1. In fact I heard on the news that half of their kids were bullyed online. And because you can go on at all hours of the day, kids can get bullied at any time. Some child say that kids are happy when they go ho,e because they cant be buuyed but @CAPS3 be bullyed at their safe place, their home. Another bad thing about the computer is that it replace exercise. A text A and @CAPS2 football scout said ""every year their are less less people who play sports because of video game or computers."" @CAPS3 the obesity rate of kids has gone up in america and many agree that the cause computers taking place of exercise. Also people think that you get better hand eye coordination but most leaders agree that you don't because it is not your hand that is moving it is your mouse. Lastly, noe grades are lower then ever for students. Most teachers say that @NUM3 in @NUM6 students get good grades and they say that all @NUM7 that don't spend to much time all the computer. I was waching discovery chanel and it said that @CAPS3 most kids are spending @NUM4 hours on the computer and less than @NUM3 hour on studying or homework. The computer made for storing information and learning. How did we let it go from that to a tool wed for @CAPS1, making lazy kids, and for anti-learning!",4,4,0
1651,"Dear, @ORGANIZATION2. A computer is a very helpful resource. It helps people navagate through life, they can find jobs, do research for school. This world wold be nothing without computers. But on the other hand some people do spend to much time on the computer. But surfing the web for countless hours is their choice. Computers can help students do research from the comfort of their own home. Instead of going to the local library and looking and looking for books, all they have to do is type in thier research topic and wallah tons of different websites are right under their noses. A computer is the world at your finger tips. Also a computer can help unemployed people find a job. Its easy, type in what city you want to work in, and there you go. You can even fill out a job application right then and there. Hey, some people even work from home. Stay at home moms can easily make money while doing daily chores like washing dishes. Also working from home can a lot less tessful. It's less stressful because you dont have to deal with annoying and impatiant co. workers. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of employment is from the workers home, @CAPS1 now you know. Working from home makes another day at the office, another day at home. Computers have helped us come along way since caveman times. Without computers this would will be nothing. We woulde have so many basic things like stoplights, elevators, and even bleders. We also wouldn't have the more sifisticated things like fockets. and cars and planes. Imagine an airport without computers, where would they store all of their information? On paper? Where would a school store all their grades and tardys? On paper? Where would the goverment store their information? On paper? With those three palces we already cut down half of the @ORGANIZATION1. Computer help the environment too. They will also help us to invent more technology so that one day we can live on @CAPS2 or something. I hope this essay changed your mind about computers. Lets recap they help students reasearch, help people find jobs, you can work from home. Helps the environment. Without computers we would live in caves and walk around with leaves for underwear like caveman. The @CAPS3 line is that computers are very helpful.",5,4,1
541,"Dear Local Newspaper, Computers are a huge thing now adays. Almost everyone has one that they use. But why do some people think that it is hurting our society. This isn't right because you need it for education, people aren't on all day, and a job. So how could those things be harmful to society. Your right they can't. Every single person has had some type of education. But how can you have an education with out a computer. If you rae working and you need to get another degree for your job. You can't go during the day so you can find a school that has online schooling, for at night. That way you don't miss work and you still get your schooling. Another reason why is that a school project or essay. You might need the computer to search up things for a project. Or cite your sorces. What if you need to type an essay what do you do then. No computers no education and you will go and works at @CAPS1 or something. Where you don't need an education. But people aren't on all day so what does that do to society. Nothing at all. Kids and adults go outside and have fun. They go on the computer to check e-mails, play games, look at facebooks/myspaces. But they have enough responcibility to go out and get fresh air. And if they sit in side then it isn't your problem because it is their life and they want to live it their way. Not the way everyone else wants them to. They can make choices for thier self and don't need others, to do it for them. So it really shouldn't effect you at all. What if at you job you need the internet. Most office people have a computer to talk to others by e-mail or to fix problems. People who work at about need the computer to access your account to get your money. People that estimate the cost of a building need it for adding something or keeping a record. The video games are a perfect example because the programers use a computer to porgram what you want to happening the game and thet takes hours to complete. So how are computers harmful to society because I still don't see it. Education, people aren't on all day and a job are really good reason that computers should becept.

1663,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you agree that people could use computers all the time and never get off. Well I don't. Think about all the negative things that could happen. Like spending less time with your family, getting addicted, and unhealthy. People who spend all there time on the computer forget that there family is there. For instance, I remember when I was little and I was on the computer and I forgot that i had family members with me, so I missed out on all the fun things like going to the mall or park. Certainly, playing on the computer is fun but woudn't you want to give some attention to your family. Almost @PERCENT1 of people in other countries be very lonely because all they @CAPS1 is play on the computer and forget about other people. You woudn't want to be like these other people right? I never thought playing on computers could be addicted. Lots of people in other countries can't last a day without playing on computers. Some say almost all the people that play on computers all day, day to night have died because they bairly eat, sleep, or use the bathroom. Imagine you life being ended because of addiction on computers. I remember when my friend told me, ""don't be on the computer to long you might die,"" and I thought it was a joke. So think about going on the computer all day and night. Not but not least, some people aren't treating their body properly. For example, some people playing on compters forget about eating, sleeping or walking around. This tends to make people's legs num and make people's stomach hurt alot. Imagine not eating, sleeping and walking around for a day. You woudn't even want to try this. Now is the time to decide, wheither people should be able to play on the computer day to night.

On the other hand, computer technology, prevents people from being active, exploring nature, and talking to family and friends in person. I want to explain to you how I feel about computers personally. I can honestly tell you that I love computers. I spend a lot of time on @CAPS3, because it lets me talk to friends I sometimes don't get to see. I can even see how my cousin in @LOCATION1 is doing. Computers also help me out with homework. For projects on a subject that I don't totally understand, I can just hop on my laptop, search what I need, and @CAPS1!, I have my information. Then after that I can type up my report and even pick out a couple of pictures to print out, see? Computer are bangin! But I can understand the other side of the issue. Computers can be time consuming. I can admit that I've spent hours at a time on the computer. This has become a problem. Experts say that people are starting to spend to much time on the computer and less time in the real world. A perfect example is my brother. He loves the @CAPS2. My mom will call him down for dinner and he'll be too engrossed in what he's doing that he will skip the meal. His friends will call him and he'll blow them off until he finishes his game. I agree that people should not spend so much time on computer. You have probably read this and thought to yourself. Well? How does she feel about it? I can honestly say, I was supposed to choose one. But here's the thing. I like my laptop. I'm addicted to @CAPS3, But, I still play sports, I talk to my family, and I even like to take walks through the words or on the beach. I neutral, like @CAPS4 from @CAPS5. Scientist say computers have positive effect on people. Some experts say they're concerned computers have a negative effect on people. @PERSON1 says they are both right. Computers are wonderful. They are one of the most growing technologies in our world.

Using the computer for email or a chat site like facebook will do that. I have cousins who live in @LOCATION2. The only way my family can keep in touch with them not spending money is email. My mom and her sister are sending emails to each other all the time. If you ask me I think that is a positive effect computers have. Have you ever researched anything using a computer? I knew I have! For a school project in @CAPS2 I had to research about @LOCATION1. I did all my research on the computer. I got an A+! I would not have gotten that grade if I did not use the computer to do research. Do you use a computer in your job? Well even if you @CAPS1't I know a lot of people who do. For example, my dad uses a computer for almost the whole day he is at work. He is a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which means he managed portfolios. He has to use @ORGANIZATION1 to check on the stock chart.

First of all, kids are so wraped up in computer games that they never go out and exercise. Second, if you ask a child anything about nature they will probably not know what to say, but they would if they spent less time on the computer. Finally, many families today never see each other because kids and their parents are too busy on the computer. These three reasons show why computers don't benefit society. Obesity is a huge problem among the children in @LOCATION1. The reason for this is that they are spending too much time online and not outdoors and exercising. Kids are not getting any fresh air or exercise and this can lead to serious health conditions. Parents sometimes don't do anything about it because they they have the same problem. This just shows that computers and other technology are effecting families around the country by making them overweight and. @CAPS1 children don't know the first thing about nature and. People say that computers educate people about things but nature and the environments is a big of our lives. The best learn about it and help. Computers the time they are, the earth might become even worse so they need to get educated on nature and the environment so they can. I know from my own experience that computers take away time from your friends and family. Instead of playing games on the computer at home, you could be spending time with your family in the park or the pool. My dad always spend his time on the computer and we never had time to spend with him. When he realized this he rearanged his schedual so we could have more time together. It is very important to spend time with your family because they are such a big part of your life and less of computer will help families do that. As you can see, getting off the computer will help kids stay in shape and healthy, educate them on the enviornment, and help families interact with each other more. If getting off the computer changed my families lifestyle then it will do the same to others as well. Hopefully you agree with me because it will surely tak a positive affect. ",5,5,1

If you are one of those people that love to be on the computer as much as you can? Well, think of it this way. You spend so much time on the computer that you recieve little or no exercise! Everyone needs to recieve a little bit of exercise in order to fit and healthy. Our country's obesity level has gone up since our high-tech computers have come out. I believe that this is one main reasons of obesity. This is a major concern in our high-tech, computer society today. Besides you recieving less exercise, you will also recieve less time with your family and friends. I understand with your family could talk to them on facebook but you need interaction by talking face to face. This is one of our basic needs as an individual. Your family is going to be by your side no matter what. But you need to build a strong relationship with your family in order for them to be there for you. This is only going to happen if you interact face to face with them. The same thing goes for friends. This is another nacessity for basic needs!!!! Everyone should have some relationship. Lastly, everyone needs to enjoy nature! It is a beautiful sight that everyone needs to expirence. Being trapped inside the house to be on your computer is a terrible thing to do. The beauties of nature are amanding everybody but @NUM1 of people don't take the opportunity to enjoy it. Being outside and enjoying yourself is a big thing for your body to survive. You need to sook up the powerful rays of the sun and have a life changing look around nature. But @CAPS1 of this will happen if you stay on your computer @NUM2.

You might not know it hut all @ORGANIZATION1 the communications in the world need a @CAPS5. There not the kind anyone could go out and but though. There satalites, the orbit the planet from space, @PERSON1, a proffesor at @ORGANIZATION1, told students at @ORGANIZATION3 that, ""A lot @ORGANIZATION1 every day items, such as rars and phones, all use some kind @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS5."" @CAPS1 computers let people communicate with each other. In addition to letting people communicate they help millions @ORGANIZATION1 people make educational and career choises. Most kids that go to college don't know a lot @ORGANIZATION1 colleges out there. When my sister was picking what college she wanted to go to she didn't know which one to choose. She sat down and looked up hundred @ORGANIZATION1 schools. after narrowing it down she had made her decision she had picked @ORGANIZATION4, a @ORGANIZATION3 she had never even heard @ORGANIZATION1 a couple months ago. People are in this type @ORGANIZATION1 situation all the time at @ORGANIZATION2 a survey was taken by all the students to see what they wanted their career to be, @CAPS2 the rest @ORGANIZATION1 the week students got to experience diffrent carrer options. @PERCENT1 @ORGANIZATION1 the students picked a different carrer after that one week. Have you ever heard the old aget ""@CAPS3 is power""? well its true and computers are a great source @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS3. they have many different subjects math, science, history language and much much more. people should be using this @CAPS3 at the @CAPS4 francisco national debate @PERSON2. Said that ""@CAPS5 are a great tool when used properly this includes looking up new places math. and even comunicating these are what computers should be used @CAPS2 not unhealthy games. You can learn about many new places with a @CAPS5. In @NUM1 grade my teacher had everyone do areport on a country me and my friend found this place we had both never heard @ORGANIZATION1. with the @CAPS5 we found onts @ORGANIZATION1 information on it such us its main income, exports, resorts, and fun activities. After reading all the facts surely one would agree that a @CAPS5 is a great tool that should be used. It lots people communicate, helps in educational decisions, and you can learn many subjects such as math, science, and language. I strongly believe that all people should use a @CAPS5.",5,4,1
255,"Dear Newspaper editor, Computers have been a great advancement in technology, but some people think otherwise. It is a great thing to have some people say but others think it is a hazard to health. I think it is an excellent thing to have. I have come up with @NUM1 reasons to support my opinion. Computers help you keep in touch with distant friends and/or family, they assist you in research, and they even let you do shopping. Firstly, if you have any relatives or friends that live far away computers have websites such as aol or facebook & myspace that you can use to keep in touch with them. Most of them are free to create an account so you don't need to worry about monthly bills for them. So this is a lot better than driving and paying gas for visiting. Computers even have webcams for video chat. With video chat you can see each other & talk at the same time, thats amazing. Secondly, you can search the web for research. If you have a project and you need more information than books give you then just use google or ask.com. You can easily find the details and information you need. All this takes is just a couple minutes, which is alot better than reading for an hour or time. Lastly, if you really want something or need it just shop online. For example if you are a really cool toy that you want to buy for your daughter or son, but its not for sale in stores then buy it off the internet. They even ship your item fast. I like buying off the internet. When I really wanted a bike I saw my mom end up getting it for my birthday. In conclusion, computers are very handy. If you need information, talk to someone, or buy something its got it. I use computers a lot. I think they are very great to have.",4,4,0
1747,"Dear local Newspaper, I think computer technogily is good. I think there are mang good effects on computers. I think the computer teaches us to work onlone with no ones help. Another good effect on the computer is we can talk to friends online. Also another thing is it gives us the ability to learn about it and surf the web. Another reason is it gives us hand cordanation. All of those are the reasons why I think the computer has good effects. My first topic, why I think there are good effects on the computer is we can do work by ourselves with no ones help. My first reason why I think that is because after looking up links on it and getting use to that homework would be eaiser. Also it will help you get more information on homework and you can get a better grade. Another reason is that you will be able to work onlone you will be able to get it done faster by going on the web. My second topic why there good effects is that you can go online and talk to freinds. My first reason why I think that because if you don't have a cell phone and you wanna talk to friends you can go online. Another reason is that is good is that if you can't do somthing and our in a bind you can tell the person that you can't. Also another reason it is good because you can talk to relatives you havent seen. My last two topics are that it gives good hand cordination and we can learn to surf the web. It gives us good hand cornation because we learn how to use our hands and fingers faster. Also it gets us away from typeing. You can learn to surf the web because after a while you will know were everything is and be a web master. Lastly you will be able to find everything you look for. In conculsion these are good effects. The computer teaches us how to type, and search on the web and learn about it. As you can see these are the reasons I think it has good effect.",4,4,0

People who are spending too much time on their computer will most likely spend less time exercisizing enjoying nature, and interaction with their family member and friends. I believe that the act of computers overwhelming a person's life should be with in a serious manner. Exersizing, an essential part of anyone's life, since the development of the internet forty years ago, the average @CAPS1 or body mass inter of an average person has increased fifteen percent! This is no coinfidence, computers are causing more and more people to challenge themselves to nex that extra mile, or swim that extra lap, and instead so home and play on their computers. This not only is hurting peoples' weights, but excersize equipment store owners are having to close their shops, because less and less people are coming into work out, or excersize like they should everyday! Our children are also being affected by this addicting sensation, childhood obesity is one of the main effects on children, because when they get heard playing on these they as well stop excersizing, and play videogames . The average amount of people who went to @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 every year was around @NUM1, but since the invention of the computer that the attendance dropped to a more @NUM2 people every year. Less and less people are to enjoy a fresh @DATE1 and instead spend it indoors on their country. This is hurting people as well as the wildlife around them. The rates of squirrels to people in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was @NUM3 in @DATE2, the year the computer has invented. But a mere ten years later, the changed so now their are squirrels! This is because now that they less people feeling less squirrels live in the @CAPS3 @CAPS3, went live in the to find food by themselves. Tour guides who worked in @LOCATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, we being fired, due to less people wanting a tour, so less tour guides are needed. Families are seeing that the more a person plays on a computer, the less time that person is going to spend talking to @LOCATION1, or @CAPS4 @CAPS5. Scientists held to have three different people spend an hour reading a book, another spend an hour on a computer, and three hours on a computer to see who could stay in a conversation with their mother the longest. The first person spent twenty minutes on the phone with their mother, the second only ten minutes, and the last, a mere five minutes. This shows that the mere time spent on a computer, the less interactions are held between son and mom, an important relationship in any one's life. Mother's worry that the next time they have a barbeque, @PERSON1 won't be in his room, playing on his computer like last time. @PERSON2 was chosen to conduct an experiment on @PERSON2 had three freinds @CAPS6, @PERSON3, and",5,5,1

Or be active, learn everyday skills and become more friendly to life people around you? @PERCENT1 of parents would agree with me on the second idea over the first one. Well I think after reading this those extra @PERCENT2 will be persuaded. Now a days @NUM1 out of @NUM2 people are over weight or obese. This can be causes by lack of exercise and inactivity. Our children need to learn @CAPS1 go out and exercise an hour a day. This could got their eyes off the computer screen. A great way to help encourage to join a sports team or a club. This can work to people away from screens and the @ORGANIZATION2 course. If we can get people out of the office this could even push them towards nature. Their are great things to @CAPS1 at the local park every day. For example you could ride a bike play games or just fool around with friends. Learning could also be a big faster in getting people out of their computer chairs. If they want to look up tell them to use dictionary, theasaurus or a book. If people on the computer but it can be teach kids and drugs. Bt @CAPS1 help find carrer options and life. sitting on front of a screen can your health and also. Their are better things to @CAPS1. Instead via internet. You can still have fun if you not good at just for instance and friends. If your a boy you could just go @CAPS1 like a park and pay carrer base bill or even wrestle. In conclusion I'd say this would want to get up and get outside. Since geting p and side could help you socialize and learn and even loose weight. So now I leave it in the hands of you whether or not to take the challenge. But just to fill you if you stay your computer it can promote the need for glasses obesity.",4,4,0
1088,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, Have you ever wanted to see the whole world with just a click of a button. That is as simple as just going out and purchasing a computer. Computers are becoming more and more popular. Some people think that people use computers too much. I am here to say that, that is a terrible accusation. First, computers help you with school work. Let's say you have an essay and it needs to be @NUM1 words or more you can just use word cant, then you have the exact amount of words. Also you might need to look up some information about a certain topic. You can just simply type in the word and search and then you have millions of choices to choose from. If you had a homework assignment that you didn't understand you could look up how to do it on the internet. But this i just the begining. Another reason computers are so great is that you can meet and interact with people all over the world and learn their culture. You can enter a free chatroom and meet someone from @LOCATION1. You would also be learning about their culture. This could also be a way to learn another language. If the person spoke fluently in @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 than he or she could teach you. You might be able to see how an @CAPS2 household runs. You could then make comparisons between the way you both live your life. Finally, you can understand the world around you. There are many websites where you can get a live sattelite feed on places on every corner of the globe. You could also do reasearch on the planet itself. You can learn about the care of the earth and what goes on inside it. You might also learn about nature. You could understand more about plants and animals. You can also got a look into space. You can learn about planets, if there is life on planets or water or anything else these would be things you can reasearch. So to sum it all up, you can get school work done. You can interact with people all over the world. You can also learn about the world around you and that covers less than a fraction of everything you can do on the computers, but don't stay on all day. Make sure you go outside and have a great time too!",4,4,0
271,"Dear Local Newspaper, I've heard about your problems with computers, and would like to state my opinion. I think that computers teach you more than they, disable you. For example , say you have a research project and you need to look someone up, you go on the computer and you got him. Also, say you want to go far for vacation; like @LOCATION1. You can go on the internet and find out how they live there. My last reason is that now you can be on the computer and still interact with family and friends. First, I stated the first one because a couple of weeks ago I had a social studies research project. But ig I couldn't use a computer then I would of had to use a book; instead of going on the computer and just looking it up. Another exsample could be like you need pictures to make the project look better . So you can go on google and find a picture to go with you project. But thats not all the internet can help you with. Like say you been planning a trip to @LOCATION1 for your honeymoon but never been there or know anything about it, but your honeymoon is a month away. You can go on the computer and learn about it. Also now they have online classes and you can learn their language before you go. But to wrap it up I have on more exsample. Lastly, chatting sosme people think because you on the computer all day you can't interact with others, but you can. for exsample, like they have a website called @ORGANIZATION1. You can chat with all your friends at once. Also they have video chatting, so you can be looking right at the person while your talking, all that's all I can think of. I hope that my lette and probably many others show you about computers actually do.",4,4,0
1043,"Dear local newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and @CAPS2 writing to talk to you about how computers benefit society. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 homes have at least @NUM3 computer in their home? Well who wouldnt! Computers let you learn more because you can research more, its quicker than having to go and look things up in the library, and with tools like @CAPS3 and facebook you can talk to people you normally dont get to see. Computers let you learn more because of the internet. With the internet you can use websites like google, @LOCATION1 and @LOCATION2. When you look stuff upon these websites and many others you can get valuable information that can get you ahead in life. For example, if I was looking up a chocolate chip recipe and I tried different things to make it unique then sold it, just think that life changed with one click on the computer. Also if I had to research a topic for @CAPS1 history project then I would go onto the computer, to google and then type in @CAPS1 topic and be overwelmed by getting the info that I needed and got an at on the project thats how computers help you learn more. Computers are very quick I can make @NUM4 powerpoints slides @CAPS6 with useful information in the time it would take me to go to the library, find a good book and write enough information to make powerpoint slide: on overage @PERCENT1 of people turn to the computer to find useful information. When I was doing @CAPS1 social studies project @TIME1 I had to find out what the @CAPS4 flag looked like. So, instead of trying to possibly find a book on the library. I just hopped on google and clicked images and clicked images and typed in @CAPS4 flag. Within seconds @CAPS1 screen was @CAPS6 with real and edited pictures of the @CAPS4 flag. It is amazing how fast information can travel from the world wide web to your computer. So would you rather be stuck in a library looking up information forever or out enjoying your life because you saved all that time by going on the computer? Have you ever heard of facebook, myspace, @CAPS3, or twitter? Well they are all great ways to communicate with people using the computer. When I am @CAPS3 or facebook I can talk to people that I might not get to see all the time one of @CAPS1 friend from camp lives in @CAPS10 so I dont get to see her alot so with the wonderful invention of facebook I could talk to her all the time. Just think without the computer facebook would have never been invented so I would have most likely lost touch with a good friend. Also when I go on the computer. I have the option signing onto something called @CAPS3 or email. With this I can talk to people and get wacky emails. That would happen if the computer wasnt invented. So dont you want information to be easier to research? Quicker to find out information. And talk to friends more easily. Well lets make it @NUM2 out of @NUM2 homes that have a computer and help benefit society by doing your part and just getting what you need on the computer then enjoying life. Just imagine how much time you are saving by using the computer.",4,5,0
654,"Dear to whom it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1, and I feel computers are bad for society. Computers have been the big difference when comparing @NUM1 to @NUM2 centuries. People have come to rely too heavily on computers. The communication globally has not been very helpful and people are spending hours on their computers every day instead of exercising. On the whole I feel society would be better off without computers. At the end of @DATE1 before the millenea would take place everyone feared what was called @NUM3. The year two thousand would supposedly be when all computers shut down and didn't work. Computers were at their beggining for society so everyone thought they were great. People were panicing over the thought of their precious computers not working. The entire nation had become reliant on computers. Everyone hid in attics and basements waiting for the world to end. Do you know what happened? The sun came out the next day and everyone logged onto their emails with a sigh of relief. Not only relief for the world not ending but for the life of computers to be able to go on. People still rely on computers just as much more today. I recently visited @LOCATION1 and in a rest every where the even had their laptop that they had to take everywhere with them. In conclusion the @CAPS2 society is at a sad state with how much they rely on computers. A fast instinct is to say communication when you why humans need computers. Why is that? We have telephones. Is there nation television channels? We have plenty of means of communication, such as ways like maybe writing a letter to someone? Communication would not be a problem in fact it has mainly caused trouble. Computers and internet allow news to be spread quickly even if it isn't free, damaging someones carrer and publicity. They also allow communication with foreign countries. Exess communication that can get countries into wars. Normally the @LOCATION3 would have no idea whats going on but with internet the nation is involved quickly. Computers breed had communication and you can easily communicate other ways with family and friends. Since I am a teen I also know the problems with youths and computers. Often times kids don't want to go outside and istead sit inside on the computer. Obesity is a rising issue in @LOCATION2 and kids need to exercise. Kids also dislike going on trips like camping outings because they don't want to leave their computer. Without computers kids would get more exercise and be less overweight. Now you have seen @CAPS1 reasoning that society would be in much better if there were no computers.",5,5,1

If you do this the wrong way it could blow out of the bold and potentially you. There are many other uses is you just can't find your family is counting on you.

The @CAPS4 reason why I say computer effect people is because it teaches you how to type faster and know now to get certain places on the computer for example say you mom was asked you do you know how to get to a certain website to buy new furniture. @CAPS6 third reason of how computers effect people is if say one day you had to do a project, on what happen during @CAPS2 revolution and you were one of those people that spend all their time looking up @CAPS2 revolution on the computer. That means that project should be real easy. The @CAPS4 reason why I say computers affect people is because they teache better communicating skills on things like facebook and @CAPS5, because when I'm in school kids tell each other to go on there facebook when they get home. I also think computer affect people because say you have a idol and wan't to look up that person for example I like football, basketball @CAPS6 idols are @PERSON1 peterson and @PERSON2 iverson, so everytime I go on the computer I look up both of @CAPS6 idols. @CAPS6 last reason why I say computers effect people are because they teach how to read because everytime on the computer haves something to read about no matter what it is.",4,4,0
1697,"Dear local newspaper editor, @CAPS1 you love haveing the enternet at your finger tips. Recently, it has been bought to my attention that some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers. I firmly believe that this is correct. My three arguments are its not healthy, the friends you meet up there are siber friends and bad @CAPS5 @MONTH1 occur. First of all, being on the computer too much is not healthy. This reminds me of my friend named @CAPS2. @CAPS2 used to be humerous, outgoing and play alot of sports. One @CAPS3 day, her mother bought her a laptop. This laptop was blue and white-her two faverite colors. She was on it all day and all night. She took it with her everywhere she went. Well, it got to the point whare she stopped the sports, gained some weight and the sadness creptped upon her. She was in a depresion mode. She went to the doctors and they told her that she had to give up the computer and play with it for only two days a week for five hours only. She listened to the doctor and it took her about three months to get back to the fun @CAPS2 she used to be. Being on the computer too much can harm you and the people around you. Second of all, the friends you meet on the enternet are called cyber friends. You don't know who they realy are, where they realy live, or their real age. They can tell you any thing they want because they know that that's a little fantasy world. That is mently not healthy. It is very important for human beings to be socialy active. Being on the computer too much can harm your brain also. Third of all, @CAPS5 @MONTH1 pop up. If you are the type of person who is on the computer every chance you get like becky, it is not good for you or the device. Being on the computer can harm even the computer. Well, you've read my arguments and ideas. Please take them into consideration.",4,4,0
1327,"Dear @CAPS1, I am writing to express my opinion on computers benefit to society. I believe that computers are very useful tools for learning and communication, but people today over use that power. You know what I mean @NUM1 gamers, @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 addicts. Or those who will do anything just to spend time on the computer. People like the @CAPS4 do not spend much time with family members, or friends, or even just outside. They do not get enough exercise, and frankly, abusing computers is not good for your life, physically or socially. Some people are working all day, leaving early in the morning and getting back late, so that they rarely spend time with those they love. But if you are hooked on the computer, as so many of us are, you @MONTH1 just not spend enough time with family and friends. Using a computer isn't exactly a social thing. One person with a mouse, a keyboard, and a monitor. You @MONTH1 say ""@CAPS5, but there are also online social networks."" @CAPS5, but how often do you even see those people in real life? Computers can take precious time away from you that you could be sharing with your family and friends. That certainly does not benefit society. A major fault in computers is that you have to be indoors. So you cannot be online chatting, or playing a game, or checking your email, outside while enjoying the beauty of the outdoors. Sure you could use a laptop outside but are you really enjoying the outdoors? Computers and outdoors go together like chocolate milk and fillet mignon - not well. That is the reason why pine tree's don't have outlets (although now you never know what they'll do next). Another side effect - that goes allong with the aforementioned statement about computers and outdoors - of computers is the lack of exercise. Once again, it is rather difficult to use a computer and jump rope at the same time. When you live as a computer vegetable, your not getting enough exercise as you could or would be. Another reason computers could lower your quality of life. Now, really, if you use the computer sparingly, and only when you needed to, or when it is nessecary you would really have none at these ""side effects."" But face it, the ruth is, computers can be addicting. Wether it's waiting for a friend to come online or your trying to get to level @NUM2 of ""@CAPS7 @CAPS8"", they can get you hooked. The idea of this article is not to prevent you from using computers, but to make sure you use them like you eat double fudge brownies with walnuts and cream cheese frosting-springly. So, now you know, computers when used to much, at obsesive amounts, are similar to drugs in the way that they are so addicting. As long as you use them correctly, they are a very, very valuable tool to be used, but over used, can be problem causing, and even prevent you from spending time with family and friends, getting exercise and even spending time outdoors. I know you certainly will agree.",5,6,1

I am sending you this message to state my opinion on the matter and in my opinion I think the computer has very good efects on people. Not only dose it have a good effect on people it also effects companies places and governments. There are many reasons why it has a good effect on people but the first and maybe one of the most important is it is an amaizing learning tool. When people are on the internet they could learn just about anything they want to on the giant mass of information we call the internet. It not only dose this but people learn how to do things through simulators from flying a plane to driveing a car. There is even more learning ability on the internet because a lot of people get home schooled on it through the internet and this @MONTH1 be an important part of their education because they might not be able to go to school because they are alway on the road or they move a lot of whatever their reason is. The computer is an important part in the invancement of the people's education. Not only can people use the computer in education but it is used as a tool in many ways, lets say your making a movie and need special effects they will use of photo shop or you need to collect and store changing information like lets say you want to stack you can always or down on a computer. Even if you were a construction worker you could your blue prints with pinpoint accuracy. Another less important thing about the computer is it gives many people entertainment. Lets you come home your bored you have nothing to do play a video game look around on the internet, it is also an important way of getting their music and or videos. This also effects many buissness and if the buissness go under becaus people werent moving ther stuff a lot of jobs will be lost and that is the last thing we need. The government also relies highly on the internet. They need it to make plans, save soldiers, and comunicate with other countries. And last but not the least we have the fitness and wellfare of the people useing computers. All I can really say to that is it is their decision.

1515,"Dear newspaper editor: @CAPS1 are all living in the age of technology. There are many useful devices that help us live our every day lives. The computer is a major help. @CAPS1 can talk with relitives from different areas and you can surf the internet to learn new information. @CAPS4 you can playing games with people from ground the world. The computer is a great divice. Almost everyone has a relitive that lives in another state or country. Well you never see them because they live far away right? With a computrer you can talk and even have a face to face conversation with them. @CAPS2 can bring your family closer together. For example, my family just got a new computer and @CAPS1 have relitives that live in florida that @CAPS1 almost never see. With the computer my dad talks to them almost everyday. Some people that I have talked to said that ther are excited to see their relitives or friends more often. @CAPS2 has brought them closer together and made them better friends. The internet is a wonder place where you can look up information for a school project and learn about different topics. When kids are doing a project in school and the information they need is not in the class book they can search @CAPS2 and @CAPS2 saves time. @PERCENT1 of kids said that when they are doing a project the best thing to use would be the internet. @CAPS4 @CAPS2 helps the kids work faster so they can spend more time outside or hanging out with their friends. Another thing you can do is learn about recent events. For example most local newspaper have a website that you can visit. Even if you local does not you can go to other websites like ""@CAPS3"". They have recent events that happen around the country and around the world. The internet is useful in many ways and can help you with your every day life. Every kid gets bored when its a rainy day. So they can play games with people from around the world using a computer. The are many websites that have fun games that are fun and enjoyabal. You can @CAPS4 become with people from other contrys. My friends @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 play the computer and they have alot of friends from other contrys. I think that its cool that you are playing the exact game with another. Person in @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2, @CAPS4 most of the games are safe and fun to play. Another thing is that you can connect and play with your friends in your home town. I have many times playes games with @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @CAPS2's a fun thing to do during a boring, rainy day. In conclusion, the computer is a useful divice thats benefits us and helps us with our everyday life. @CAPS2 allows us to connect with family in far away places and surf the internet for new information. @CAPS4 you can play games with people from around the world. Its a wonderful divice and lets start using @CAPS2. ",5,5,1
1230,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 you ever wonder who really invented the ice cream cone while standing there licking one? Well why don't you just rip out your blackberry and find out? That is that great thing about technology. You can talk to friends or family get help, and it is there. Whenever you need it. Have you ever had to move so far away from your best friend that you cried so much someone thought it was raining? Well this is not nessesary because you can now have a webcam in your computer and talk as much as possible. Of course, its out the same as being there with the person, but its pretty close. You can talk whenever, wherever, with the great invention of computers. One other way that a computer benifits talking in other people @MONTH1 be you and your friends can chat. If your parents are out and won't let you get out you can still talk to your friends. Lastly if you are older you can use facebook to find friends you have not seen in a long amount at time. Another reason that the computer and technology are great is because you can get information you need it. Schools practicaly live on computers. Not only the students but teachers too. The teachers assign projects that include going on the computers and finding information all about your topic. Also if you just that you have never heard of before you can go and find out about it. It is great to those all you have to @CAPS2 is clik a buttom and every bit of information is at you fingertips. This can coms in handy when you are in a fight with your friend about who is a better @PERSON1. You can just look up who has gotten more home runs and there you go. You've got a winner! Have you ever been at dinner and someone ask if you have the hockey game score and you friends, husband brothers out his phone and then says @NUM1 to @NUM2 about @NUM3 minutes after you asked? Well that must mean they have internet on their phone. Phones such as blackberrys, @CAPS3, and iPhone all have internet built in. This means when they are in the airport waiting for their plane, they can just play a game or watch some television. To me that is a pretty cool invention. Also people in business and industry have phones with internet built in because they can just look something up at anytime. So this is why I think having technology is good in our society. Ecspecially because they can talk to far away friends and whatever. Kind of information you need you can already have it with a touch of a button. Also, you can have it in stuff such as you phone or in another technology related thing.",5,5,1

907,"Dear newspaper and readers of @LOCATION1, I am @PERSON1, a student from @ORGANIZATION1, I have recently been enformed about the argument over computer use and I feel it is silly. We need computers in life to help us do jobs, communicate with family or friends traveling the world, and for research on homework. First of all, without computers many people would struggle. My father uses a computer for his job and he couldn't do his job without one. Sure, many people spend way to much time on their computer, but other people use it to save information or find research. I know people argue that computers should be used less, but could you get through a week without using one computer? Most people couldn't, especially if you own a buisness. In addition, from using computers for jobs, some people like to chat online with a friend that move away. Imagine if your family member or friend traveled constantly and they went to places where they couldn't get connection on their cell phone, the only way to talk to them is chating through the web. I'm sure everyone has used a computer once to talk to a friend or for something related to buisness, so they are more useful than people relize. Lastly, as a kid we need to be able to use a computer, not just to talk to friends but for homework. Some homework requires us to make powerpoints, write a paper on historical facts, and we need computers to do so. Without computers, kids wouldn't be able to gather facts or information to write a paper. Decreasing computer use for kids can potentialy bring down their grades. My teacher always says, ""grades are the most imfortant thing."" I'm sure all parents would agree with that. All in all, we can't decrease the use of computers because it can do damage to peoples lives. Think about people who travel alot, kids with work that needs to be done, and parents with jobs that they need computers for, don't upset all of these people by decreasing computer time. Thank you for your time,",5,4,1
1133,"Dear @CAPS1 news editors, @CAPS2, my name is @PERSON1, and I would like you to write an article on the effects computers have on people. Computers have been the technological item to have over the past @NUM1 or so years. They allow people to learn many new skills, get important work done, and even socialize! However some experts believe that people spend to much time on computers, and that people are not as active or healthy because of it, and. Everyone wants to be healthy. While computers are fun and useful, could they have a negative effect on society? @PERCENT1 of @CAPS3 are employed as of @DATE1, and with that number dropping people need to get more work done to keep their jobs, or even keep their businesses open. With computers available at work (or school) much more work can be done, with programs like @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 people can type reports, and with programs like @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION2, and iCalculator, workers can calculate taxes faster, so they have more time to work. Some people are working with stocks, and these days, the stocks could be good or bad, so you need to keep up! You can go to the stock websites and control what you buy and sell, without raising you phone bill from calling the brokers. Laptops make work possible on the go to! Computers teach many skills you need to know for jobs, and other skills you @MONTH1 need times in life. You can learn typing, work programs, and programing which are all needed in some lines of work. Computers increase math skills and hand eye coordination to! And you can read your favorite books via online scans!, now you @MONTH1 be wondering why not pick up a real book? Well, you canÂ’t online scans, and some are free! Not only do computers teach skills and work, they are very fun too! Between @CAPS6, twitter, email, googleBUZZ, mySpace, ooVoo, skype and gamesradar, there are lots of ways to talk to friends and meet new people. On @CAPS6 I can have up to @NUM2 people talk to whenever I want! Why not talk to real people? you ask, well the answer is simple, maybe it is a lazy @DATE2 and nobody wants to go out anywhere, or maybe your friends want to talk right before bed time. Talking to real people is important, but canÂ’t be done all the time! Online gaming has become an sensation!, and not only an @NUM3, @NUM4 and @CAPS8, @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 can Â“gameÂ” too! So many people are gaming now, that if your not, you are missing out on an amazing experience. Some people think gaming is a waste of time, but the same can be said for any indoor leisure activity, everybody needs a fun activity they can do anytime! Besides everybody likes having fun! Some people believe the ludicrous notion that technology is making @LOCATION1 into fat, lifeless losers, but, it is opposite, you can socialize online and meet new people. People (like myself) can balance computers and games, with exercize and sports. With computers you can efficently complete work and learn new skills! Computers are posotive if used correctly. I hope you like this artice, thanks for reading.",6,6,1
475,"@ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS1 technology continues to become more and more enhanced so has the percentage of americans who use computers. @PERCENT1 of those americans, are children from the ages of @NUM1 to @NUM2. Most teens use the computer to interact with friends on social sites or spend a good chunck of their home playing online games. But what about the other teens; the ones who are constantly facing cyber bullying or are put in dangers way by talking to people they don't even know? To prevent these issues, I say we put a limit on our use of technology. Social sites, such @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and facebook, have been growing at an alarming rate. More teens would rather be on the computer than outside playing tag or on a swingset. I, myself, have an @CAPS2, facebook, and @CAPS3 and it's prevented me from getting exercise becaose it's almost like i'd rather be talking to my friends than going for a jog. It bothers me, it really does, but there is one question I always risk myself; how do I stop? I've been going on runs, studying more, and spending time with my family. There's ways and reasons to stop being so attached to technology, we just don't know how to get the message spread. Other than the affects social sites and exercise has had because of computers, online gaming is also a big issue too. Many kids, not mostly boys, to what I see at school are absolutely loving online gaming. But the only people that actually benefits in life are the website owners. These games are not educational, it's not a good why to spend a couple of hours of your time. So generally it's a waste. More important things should be done during this time like studying or doing homework. Just think, you could even hangout with friends doring that time rather than sharing on a monitor. Although computer gaming is a big reason why kids go on the computer, bullying is a huge factor along with stranger danger on chats. If, you're someone who's bullied constantly at school, you think being able to go home and spend time on the computer is amazing; until bulling came along. Cyber bullying can lead to a child working themselves, getting fights at school or even worse, someone's like taken because they didn't think it was worth living. Limited computer use or parental control would really help prevent this. Computer usage has its ups and downs,but my point is safety, health, and education, one the main issues we face because of modern technology. I'd like to hear that my letter to your newspaper was read. Please get back to me with your thoughts on this issue within the next three days by email.",5,4,1

I think the computer teaches you hand-eye coordination. The computer also lets you up a leave more a foriegn people and paces. Lastly, computers helps you communicate with others. As recently stated, I think computers are useful because they help with your hand-eye coordination. For example, when you write papers for school or a document for work, you're using the coordination. You didn't even notice how once hang of typing, you tend to move faster. This machine is a beautiful invention please don't take @CAPS1 away!. The computer is also to everyday life and is very useful for learning new things about far away places and people. Another thing that you dont realizes when using a computer is that the you do from someone in your but from long distance places.

28,"Dear Newspaper, Computers are high tec and have expanded in an everyday thing. They play a big role in society. Computers have been improved to do many different things without them we would barely get any thing done. Although kids should start goind outside more, computers teaches kids new things, and it is useful. With computers kids are rarely going outside. A lot of our population of the @LOCATION1 are obese, including kids. Because of this they are staying inside and on their computer. Kids need to go outside evry once and while to get some fresh air and exercise. If they limit their time on the computer and do some active game it would be better for the child. Since computers are rapidly growing and adapting kids spend half of the day on it just stareing at the screen playing some flash game, like run escape. Instead of wasteing their time doing that they should go outside, take a walk just do something! Computers teaches kids new things. Google something like trees. You would get bunch of websites containg information about trees. Kids also play games, if they don't know it, some of the games they play are teaching them stuff, for an example, my little sister, goes on a site called nickeloden.com I see that right and it teaches her stuff she didn't know before. from those types of games it prepared her for kindergarden. Now a days more and more sites keep adapting and becoming known like bing. Computers are real useful. suppose you want to know whats goind on at work. So click your mouse on internet explorer and get your email. With computers, you could go on social networking sites, like facebook and connect with friends. You can also go on instant messageing site to talk to friends and see what there up to. For your entertainment you could play games. Remember though to not stay on too long.

1452,"Dear @PERSON4, I strongly believe that use of computer is beneficial to the community. One reason I feel this way is that computers can improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. These computers provide access to games helpful in @ORGANIZATION2 training. In fact, @ORGANIZATION2, in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1, just began using these games as part of their training this @DATE1. Instructors report that @ORGANIZATION2 skills in trainees and students are far better than in years past. Additionally, computer games can improve reflexes. Two years ago, a man named @PERSON3, @NUM1 years old, fell onto the train tracks just as a train was coming by. Through extra-ordinary reflexes he managed to leap out of the way, saving his life. When asked how he did @CAPS5, he said he had been playing computer games since he was @NUM2 years old. These games also make you more intelligent. The @ORGANIZATION1's @DATE2 study reports that brains were @PERCENT1 more active after use of computers. The researchers achieved this data by attaching electrolytes to the patient's brain both before and after using the computer. @CAPS5 is for these reasons that computers improve hand-eye coordination and other skills. Another reason for why computers are beneficial is that they allow you to talk online. They even allow you to communicate with your family who live far away, strengthening your relationships. I recently got back in touch with my cousin who moved to @LOCATION3. Letters were too expensive and took too long, but email and skype provide us with a great alternative. These computers also improve social skills. @PERSON1, resident here in town, says, ""I love using computers because I can talk to my friends whenever I want, and I feel like @CAPS5 really helps us communicate."" Who wouldn't love a machine that provides a service like that? These computers can even improve your mood. In a test done by @ORGANIZATION3 in @DATE3, @NUM3 people were put in seperate rooms with personal computers for @NUM4 hour. Afterwards, @PERCENT2 said they felt an improvement in their mood. Computers are great because they allow you to talk online. Finally, computers allow you to learn about other places. Virtual tours are becoming more and more common today. Infact, at @CAPS2.org, you can take virtual tours of over @NUM5 different countries, including @LOCATION5, @LOCATION4, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION6. You can also learn about other cultures and their traditions through online videos at youtube.com and articles at wikipedia.org, the free encyclopedia. You can even learn new recipes. Celebrity chef extraordinare @PERSON2 not only posts all her recipes online at mstewart.com, but she even finds some of them! In a recent interview by @CAPS3 magazine, when asked where she's found some of her best recipes, including her famous @CAPS4 chocolate cake, @PERSON2 admits she found most of them online, saying, ""@CAPS5's a powerful resource that more people should use. Al @CAPS6 currently owns the world's best cookbook!"" @CAPS5 is because of this that computers allow you to learn about other place.

1459,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, Some people @MONTH1 thingk that computers are helping our society, but I disagree.

Do you want to be the one sitting on a coputer all day getting fat or do you wan't to be physically fit while getting exercise. The only workout your getting on the computer is your fingers. So you should be getiting off your lazy bum, bum and getting some good old exercise. Yes computers teach you things, but exercise teaches you you things while you are getting fit. Who wouldn't want to see the beauty of nature. Yes you can see pictures of nature on the computer, but those are just a bunch of pixels mushed together. In the real world it is all natural and sometimes more beautiful than on the computer. How doesn't that sound better than the computer.

People do not exercise enough, strain their eyes, and have less interaction with real people. One reason computers are having negative affect on people is because they no longer get enough exercise. Take my freind @CAPS1 for example. He was a triathlete, who trained everyday so he could be in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man in @LOCATION1 next @DATE1.

However, they are not taught how bad they can be for you health when used too much."" @CAPS6, computers are a problem to our health.

But she is not the only one to lose her vision because of computers. Scientests at the @CAPS7 lab in @LOCATION2 said that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 regular computer users lost their vision within two years.

We estimate @PERCENT2 of this next generation will be legally blind before age @NUM3."" @CAPS9, this new technology is harmful and very damaging to our vision. A third reason people should not use computer is because they stop interacting with real people. My uncle, @PERSON4, lives in @LOCATION3. We used to see each other from time to time and talk on the phone about once a week. That is, until he found out about the chat rooms and virtual worlds on the internet. Now, I haven't seen or talked to him in almost a @DATE1 because he has created a new family on the computer and spends the whole day pretending he is a @CAPS10 an fighting dragons on the internet game @CAPS10 @CAPS11. But he is not the only person with this issue. It is proven that @PERCENT3 of people who go into games like these or chatrooms lose interest in friends and family and their social skills worsen. Professor @PERSON2 had this to say about how this is affecting @CAPS5. ""Too many @CAPS5 are finding out about these sites and getting hooked. They stop caring about school, sports, even their friends. It's alarming!"" @CAPS12 reason could you have to use a computer after learning how bad it is for you and your @CAPS5!

Also some people have bad hand writing. @CAPS1 last opinion is we can type to people that are online and offline. I say this because if you have to tell a family member, or a friend something important but, you phone is dead or broken you can e-mail them. Or if you have a facebook you can tell them on that. Last you can I.M them. Now that you know three opinion's on what effects computer's have, people can alway's excrise around there house or around there block.",4,4,0
166,"To editor, @CAPS1's a beautiful day. The sun is shining, the birds are chirping, and a lazy breeze is flowing through the trees. But you don't notice any of @CAPS1 because you're plopped down in front of your comuter tapping away on @CAPS2 or email. With modern technology. This is a common scenario. Experts are concerned that excessive computer use can harm your health, hamper your social skills, and cause you to be disconnected from nature. While computers are helpful in our lives too much of one thing is never a good thing. As mentioned, camputers have can a negative effect on your health. Computers cause people to be lazy. They would rather @CAPS2 and email than go outside and excersize in the cool, crisp, fresh air. In fact, statistics recently released by the @ORGANIZATION1 show that computers are the @NUM1 leading reason for obesity. And weight problems are not the only thing computer to worry about. Too much time in front of the computer will also take @CAPS1's toll on your eyes. Even local doctors have pointed @CAPS1. ""@CAPS4 since computers have become a common household item, the number of i have eye has gone up about @NUM2 or @NUM3 more kids every year than the year says @ORGANIZATION3 of the @ORGANIZATION2. And if that isn't enough, typing too many this @CAPS5 and emails day after day can give you repetetive syndrome, also known as carpal tunnel. Carpal tunnel used to be more when typewriters were big, but dwindled down once computers with newer, easier to type on keyboards came around. But excessive daily use of computers is causing doctors to see more cases of carpal tunnel crop up. @CAPS1 is clear that if you want to stay healthy, computer usage should be limited. Secondly, too much time spent on the computer affect your ability to communicate with others. Computers are helpful when you need to talk to someone but people have gott on so used in @CAPS1 that they sometimes find @CAPS1 awkward to talk to someone face to face. Their eyes look everywhere except for the person, they shift their weight back and forth and struggle to find the right words to say things that should be easy. This awkwardness can also ruin previously close friendships. Friends will talk to each other endlessly through @CAPS2, but have no words for each other when they meet face to face. I remember @DATE1, i didn't see one of my friends at all; we just @CAPS8 each other daily. When we saw each other at school, we found @CAPS1 hard to carry a conversation and @CAPS1 took some getting used to talking face to face again. And this isn't the only way friendships are ut on the line by computers. Personal and meaningful conversations @MONTH1 sometimes be. You're on the phone with your friend and you're telling her about something important that you need advice on. A few seconds after you begin talking you're interrupted by a loud @CAPS7! followed by a ""hold on, so and so just @CAPS8 me."" @CAPS9, computers seriously social skills and personal relationships. Another reason to watch how much time you spend on the comuter is that @CAPS1 can cause you to",4,6,0
1176,"Dear newspaper I hear the more and more people use computers and I think thats so awesome because people talk online with other people. @CAPS5 they teach you how to use a computer. It gives people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. Computers it the more advanced technology so its @CAPS1 the people is using it. I love to be in the computer all day because I always enter to @CAPS2 and talk online. @CAPS4 example some people like to talk with a family member the is not in the @LOCATION1 so they communicate from the computer. Sometimes I talk online with my cousin in @LOCATION2 because I have @NUM1 years I dont see her. So I think talk online or using the computer is important. @CAPS4 example even grandma have @CAPS3 and she talks online with her family members. I think the using the computer is not a bad benefit because it helps you be in communication with your family or friends. That is why I think the people is wrong saying the or is not. Secondly, it teach you hand-eye coordination my grandma is old but computer and @CAPS4 example my grandma a nice hand eye coordination because when she goes to the letters she just ress and all she is correct. think computers have a effect on people. It @CAPS5 helps people write better and better. @CAPS4 example I love and when it write I dont need to go to other I write king of @CAPS5 the helps me with my eye and hand @CAPS6 is the it helps you find faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example on @ORGANIZATION1 you find what ever street you want. It @CAPS5 help you find in the computer about people. @CAPS4 example if I have a project I find the information on @ORGANIZATION1 about people or places. The computer is really helpful because you could find pictures of places and information of people. I think is a positive effect on people. Finally, I think the computers are great benefits society. One reason is the you could talk online with people. @CAPS5 it teach you hand-eye and the helps your brain and sight. It @CAPS5 helps you at your hand movements. @CAPS6 reason is the give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people. @CAPS4 example I have a project in @CAPS7 and I have to learn and search about forensic doctor and I search everything on the computer. I think the computers help your brain think more and computers are advanced technology. So I think their benefits our society.",4,4,0
859,"The innovation of computers was a great leap into discovery. Unfortunately, the negative aspects of this magnificent invention detract from the novelty. With the computer came a plague of not exercising and a disinterest in, perhaps even an inabilty to enjoy nature. On top of this destruction of the mind, this monster is the cruel cause of many declining relationships for who has time for friends and family while in the middle of an internet game? As unique and intriguing as the computer might be, it is slowly destroying the mind. Increasing interest in a monitor tends to result in decreasing care for exercise as well as a decline in the amount of exercise gotten each day. While playing on the computer, the mind @MONTH1 be racing but the body sits unmoving, @CAPS1 activity is being done. Indeed, for some the addiction is awful enough that the person only moves to get food, use a restroom, go to bed or when a parent demands it. All of the day's food settles into the stomach and little to none of it is burned off. Meanwhile, in some of the more severe cases the person is so entranced that bedtimes are pushed later. Sleep is essential to the body and mind and going without can be damaging. Nowadays the computer detracts from the sleep and exercise that the body requires. Even nature suffered from the advent of computers. Fewer people went out to admire its beauty. Nature is a wonderful teacher about the circle of life and the natural way of the world. Oftentimes parallels can be drawn between the wild and the tamed. Attached as people are to computers, they cannot experience the world to the fullest. Some argue that flora and fauna can be found online, but seeing a picture is different, almost cheating, compared to being beside the plant, able to study it from all angles rather than in an unmoving form. The experience is not the same. Also, computers are indoors, so the true world is chielded from view. Even nowadays with laptops if one was to be brought outside, the user would be focusing on the screen, not what is around them. Computers have severely cut down on the admiration of nature. Even family and friends suffer when computers are around. Many people barely pay attention to conversation while focusing on the screen. They tend to onlypretend to listen half the time. Even when chatting with friends online, the conversation is disjointed because attention is probably focused on another part of the internet. Frequently, during conversations without a computer nearby, the mind is focused on something from earlier that day. Relationships are suffering, and computers are at fault. Computers are sucking in society, more of it each day. Much of what is done on computers, like the study of faraway places, can easily be found in books. Computers have resulted in a lack of exercise, less time with nature, strained relationships, and a generally unhealthy lifestyle. Through all of this, they have returned little to society. Why does the world continue to put up with computers and their negative effect on humanity?",6,6,1
1419,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I have reason to believe that computers and other similar modern technologie is breaking up the world we once were. Things such as computers are a main cause of @CAPS3 lacking exercise, interaction with family and friends, and is also a possible danger to ones mental health. The leading cause of obecity and an outrageous amount of overweight people in @LOCATION1, is the fact that people spend way to much time on computers, and not excersizing. I have recently found out that in the @DATE1's the average familly had one computer (sometimes none). Nowadays, the average familly has up to @NUM1, @NUM2, or even more! Furthermore, the percentage of obese peoples has sky rocketed since then, because people are almost always on the computer, rather than exercising like they should be. A major reason that modern technologie has hur t our nation, is that there is an immence lack of communication and interaction between families. Families are fighting/arguing more often, and spouses getting in divorces because they never get to spend time together. Studies have shown that nowadays @NUM3 of @NUM1 marages ends in a divorce, where as in @DATE2, it was @NUM3 of @NUM6. Advances in technologie have astoundingly increased since then, and people are on the computer/phones/other @CAPS4 which is separating families everywhere. When impubesent children are trying to grow and expand their minds, all they are doing is sitting on the computer, and not getting the brain nutrition they need. The students in schools today are the future leaders of the world. Now the parents should be thinking, if they want their children to do well, or exeed their expectation in life, then they should not be sitting on the computer all day filling their-heads with nonesence. Now, computers do have the abillity to be educationally usefull, but do children use them that way? The answer in no, and, ""@PERCENT1 of the time, neither do adults"", state @PERSON1 from the @ORGANIZATION1. I hope you can agree on the fact that computers are causing more bad than good in familes all around the world. People are not getting the amount of exercise they need, aren't interacting with family enough, and these computers can become harmfull to the mental health of future generations. If famillies can minimize the amounts of computer-drawn activities, then I think parents all over the world can modify themselves about their childrens health.",5,5,1

482,"Dear @CAPS1 of Newspaper, @CAPS2 has been brought up to concern that computers are a mence to society. On the Computers are very helpfull. If one needed directions to a place or if one wanted to know how to do something @CAPS2 would show how to. They also can help you do things like read faster and hand eye corridnation. Computers are also a good form of entertianment. Those are some of the reasons computers are helpfull. First, computers can help find out how to do things. If there is evey somewhere far to go or there are many winding roads to get there you can use the computer. On the computer there are many maps that give detialed discriptions on how to get places. Specialist say that over @PERCENT1 veiwers get to their destianation. The due to lack of driving skills. Computers also help with instructions on how to make things. If there is a cake to be made the computer will have recipies to make @CAPS2. That also can help make projects. For example They show things about @CAPS3 mythology for making a @CAPS3 pat. The computer can help you, learn langues. There is software that can teach people languages just like books execpt that they have animated teachers to help speak the languege that one got directions to go to. Reading all the didn't langues can help you with normal reading. Another reason that computers are helpful is they can help people with reading. Did you know that @NUM1 out of @NUM2 americans have trouble reading. That wouldn't happen if they had computers. Almost everything on the computer has to be read so @CAPS2 gives a lot of practices. @CAPS2 also will improve hand eye corodination. When someone something they watch the screen not their hand. Also on microcoft word to type an essay you watch the screen not your fingers typing. There are many games on the computer for improving hand eye corrdination. The last reason that computers affect people is that they are enteritaining. One the internet there are many fun games for all ages. Some games they could watch videos one youtube there are many funny videos there. As you can see computers are helpfull in many ways. They will give directionn to places or help people with reading, Computers are entertianing and fun.",5,4,1

She gets paid loads of money. Today she trys to get me to learn about all tech stuff. If you have kids you know you only want the best in their present & future.

I know you thinking there a lot of ""@CAPS4"" thing on the internet dont want my kids to see, conversly you can set limits & child block. & you also dont want you kids at risk of obesity because of lack of excercise. So give them time limits. My cousins each go on the computer @NUM6 hours a day. They do @CAPS2 & whatever time they have left they chat with friends. Its not all @CAPS4.

816,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I am a student at @ORGANIZATION3 middle school in @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 recently you produced an article about computers where good or bad people I write today to say that computers are beneficial to people everywhere. This is true because computers help people with things hand eye coordination to learning advances to our schools finally it helps people communicate with ease, @CAPS7 plase consider the following. First of all computers help hand eye coordination greatly in the long run. This is true because people playing games on the computers got more skillful with using ther hands and eyes together. @ORGANIZATION1 ullodhers from @ORGANIZATION4 @LOCATION1 ""Computers help hand eye coordination @PERCENT1 more than putting your son or daughter on the football team"" @CAPS8 computer games could help kids get more acurate with there skills or that of any sport. @CAPS7 now you know why computers help people develop better hand eye coordination.

886,"Debates have come up on whether or not computers are benefiting or destroying society. Computers are only helping in aid in the growth of society. Computers allow people to interact with other people, see and discover other places and people, and teach hand-eye coordination. Computers are helping people more than they are hurting them. First of all, computers allow people to meet and interact with other people. There are many popular websites that allow people to chat and communicate at anytime. Before computers were invented in order to talk to someone you would have to meet with them face-to-face, or send them a letter and wait on awfuly time get a responce. Now people can simply type up an email and hit send. Just like that, their message is sent to another computer for others to read and enjoy. Another advancement computer technology has developed is picture sharing. All one has to do to display and show their pictures to everyone is done by simply hooking up a camera, uploading your pictures onto your computer, and posting them on a site like @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 bucket. Any in- the- @CAPS3 person would @CAPS3 that computers are very useful. Secondly, computers are important because they give people the ability to learn about and discover people & places that are new to them. In the old days if you did not @CAPS3 about something or someone, like a movie, you @MONTH1 never find any info about them. Computers have internet websites and search like @ORGANIZATION1, that allow you to type anything and instantly find all the @CAPS4 information and pictures or that subject. These technological advances have given many people the general knowledge that they very well @MONTH1 need in any given situation. If you missed the best part of a you could easily go on a computer, look it up and importance of computers in every day society. Last of all, computer hand - eye coordination that is vital to every day life. Typing on a computer in leisure time is a skill that will be looked for everywhere. In fact, many employers @MONTH1 hire you based on your keyboarding skills, ones one is skilled enough they @MONTH1 even teach themselves to type without looking at the keyboard. Although computers are not meant to replace your friends, family, and @CAPS5 air, they are very important tools that give you skills you will use for the rest of your life. Any individual that is highly educated would see the pluses in computer usage. in conclusion, computers are vital in order to properly function in many situations. They allow you to chat and send pictures to loved ones, teach you about faraway people and places that you @MONTH1 not @CAPS3 about other wise, and help one improve on their hand - eye coordination. Computers are very useful peices of equipment.",6,5,1
12,Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 I feel that computers do take away from peoples life and arenÂ’t as important than the other factors of life. First of all you know that the world is becoming obease because of lack of exercise. Also people don't realize that @CAPS3 warming is becomeing a big problum. Finally familys arn't as close as they used to be. these are all the reasons why computers arn't important to human socioty. First of the world is becomeing obease and cumputers play a huge part in this. Computers don't make people exercise they basicly just sit down on there couch and use the computer this won't help amarica get back into shape. Also computers become a habbit if a person uses a computer everyday of there life it will become an addiction then they won't be able to stop. Finally when people use the computer they don't realize the lack exersise there getting. This is the first reason why computeres are a bad thing. Next @CAPS3 warming is mealting the polar ice caps. Computers play a part in @CAPS3 warming because they use electricty and thjen the electrisity melts the polar ice caps. If this keeps happining then they will all melt and we will not have a shorline and half of the world will be fluded. Finally computers play a huge part in @CAPS3 warming because of the fact that they are so popular. This is another reason why computers are bad. Finally the last reason why computers are bad is because they take away from your family life. For instance there are more and more familys splitting up now and sientest sat that @PERCENT1 of the time it's because of technolagy. When on peroson is on the computer the other people feel that they love the computer more than they love themselfs. Then they split up for good. This is the last reason why I feel computers are bad. In conclution you can see that computeres are a bad thing. First of all you can see that amarica is becomeing obease because of the computers. Also computers are causeing @CAPS3 warming and are eventually goung to flood the earth. And last but not least computers take away from peoples family life and cause them to split up and become unhappy. These are all the reasons why computers are bad.,4,4,0

Lastly, computers just help for the need of entertainment for people. Computers are one of the most used tools on the planet. Almost every family has one, some people even have more than @NUM1. Let's face it, there are many people traveling around the world, just trying to make a decent living for their families.

1382,"Dear The @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I belive that computers offer a lot more pros than they do cons. Computers offer another way to learn things about the world. Computers @MONTH1 also act as a research, tool. If a child, or anyone @CAPS3 on the computer and a family member thinks it @CAPS3 an unreasonable amount of time, that sounds like it @CAPS3 just an issue between the person and his or her family. Many people @MONTH1 argue and say, ""look in the encyclipedea to learn about the world, ""but a computer @CAPS3 faster, easier more time efficient to use.

Some people @MONTH1 like the old ways, but personally. I like the freedom and easiness of a computer. Have you ever had to research for a project or report? Many people either in school or in the work field will most likely need to research something to get a better understanding. Yes, a dictionary @CAPS3 helpful. Yes a thesauris @CAPS3 helpful but there are separate things. Compared to a computer those classic research tools are still usefull, but could be a hassle. My point @CAPS3 a computer has a dictionary thesauris, encyclipedea...ect all in @NUM1! So next time you have to research something try reaching for the keyboard @CAPS4 of the bookshelf! To me, the problem of someone being on the computer too much sounds more like a Family problem than a social problem. Technology has changed our world! Ever since computers were invented not only have they downsized, but became more and more useful. The computer has opened more doors for our scociety, without computers, space travel for example would not be the normality it seems to be in this generation. All im trying to say @CAPS3, I don't think computers hurt our society, but are pretty much the building blocks for our world. While reading this paper I hope you noticed the pros of having computers in this world.

1703,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3, The effects computers have on people can be hurting our society or it can also be helping society. As a middle schoolers growing up, I believe using computers can be beneficial at same point but it is also damaging our society. First of all, the internet is full of innapproprate content. Illegal uses are involved and can draw in anyone with just s single click of a mouse. Anyone in the world can use the technology we have today to ""hack"" or tresspass someone else's computer. Anybody can download songs or documents illegally for free, rather than paying for it themselves. In fact, not only can someone download innapropriate content right onto their screen, they can also be inflicted upon with graphic words or view a website that involves videos with drug use. criminal acts, vulgar language and more. A recent study on internet use from the @ORGANIZATION1 for internet use includes that ""@CAPS4 @CAPS5"" has a history of a result to suicides or depression in teens. @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is a form of @CAPS5 where someone can chat or instant message someone and hurt their feelings. Not only is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 an issue, however, people can now talk to strangers on the internet. Think about how awful it would be if your child had given out their private information online and a man who said they were the same age as your child received it and lied about their age, sex, apperance, and age. Now that man can track your child down and possibly kidnap or hurt them. Secondly, the internet can also be very unhealthy and can create you to become less social. According to @CAPS7 @CAPS8 at @ORGANIZATION2, @PERCENT1 of children or teenagers that result to internet use can create a weak relationship with friends and family members if they use the computer too much. It can be very unhealthy for someone, and not just teenagers, to use the computer for an extended amount of time than they should. People can gain the effects of laziness, little brain effort, and lose interaction with the outside world. Finally, my foremost reason on how computers can be negative is how addicting it can be. From my own experience, I used to stay up late for hours using websites such as @CAPS9 because everyone else was using it. Sure, it can be entertaining and fun but using the internet won't be so much ""fun"" when your academic grades are at risk and you stop communicating with the outside world. Adiction can draw anyone in against their willpower. My own brother became so addicted to computer games that he played one game straight for @NUM1 hours straight. You can get addicted to one subject until you lose everything else you have. The internet can be great in moderation, however it can be innappropriate, unhealthy, and addicting. If technology becomes too powerful in our civilization, how can we learn to interact with our humanity. More and more peole become involved with technology and frankly it can be quite horrendous in my oppinnion.",5,6,1
32,"Dear Local Newspaper, @CAPS1 name is @PERSON1 and I am a @ORGANIZATION1 citizen. I believe that computers do NOT benefit society of all! In @CAPS1 opinion, they make our town worse. People spend way too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. All of these things are @CAPS3 computers are doing to our society and it's time to make a stop to it! First of all, people are on the computer way too much. Teens are on social networking sites, adults are on chatrooms, and kids are playing computer games. Instead of that, people should be playing outside, or going for a walk in the park. Did you know that @PERCENT1 of adults are overweight? If people cut back the amount of time indoors, we could probably bring that number way down. Also, who knows @CAPS3 teens are doing on the computer. Computers have good things but they can also be bad. For example, chatrooms who knows @CAPS3 kind of people are in chatrooms. Children need to be careful about @CAPS3 they say or show on the internet. Instead of playing games or talking to their boyfriends and girlfriends, teens should go outside and exercise. Second, more citizens need to enjoy nature and the beautiful senery around them. Were all so busy running to check our e-mail, we don't notice @CAPS3 a beautiful day it is outside. On a nice @DATE1 or @DATE2 day, people should take this kids to a local park or pond. This reminds me of last @DATE2 when I went to @CAPS1 cousins house. @CAPS1 aunt only allowed us to watch one hour as a day, that included the computer. We were outside every single day, even if we were just staring into the clouds. This kept us active and enjoy the environment. @CAPS1 last reason why computers are badly affecting society is that computers take time away from interacting with family and friends. I know @CAPS3 your thinking, when your on the computer you are talking to family and friends, but it isn't the same. Instead of instant messaging call them. Maybe even invite them our to talk face to face. That reminds me of @CAPS1 sister. When I get home, she will normally be on @CAPS2. Now, instead of getting up and coming to talk to me she will text me ""@CAPS3's up?"" or ""@CAPS4 was your day?"" Computers help people communicate, but they also take communication away. As you can see, I have given you three reasons why I strongly believe computers are badly @ORGANIZATION1. Not only @ORGANIZATION1 but everywhere! You need to open your eyes and understand that people spend way too much time on computers, they allow people to not enjoy nature, or interact with their families. Please I'm asking you to understand that our society will crash it we don't fix this issue. So @CAPS3 are you going to do about it?",5,5,1
1414,"Dear @CAPS1, More and more people use computers, but not everyone agrees that this benefits society. I support advantages in technology and believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Computers give people the ability to learn about faraway places and people, they allow you to talk to people online, and you can play games games that can help you with your school-work. Do you believe that computers give people the ability to learn about faraway people and places? You can use google.com and look up different cultures and find out how the stuff they do is different from us and what kind of food they eat. For example, in @LOCATION1, they sit on the floor @CAPS2 they eat. We get to sit at a table on our dining rooms or kitchens. @PERCENT1 of people in would floor. Surely, computers allow you @CAPS2 my cousin on the computer and @CAPS3 important to note that, on computers you can play games that can help you with your school-work. You can go on sites that you on your @CAPS4. Show you how your body works for @CAPS5, and tell you about the revolutionary war for @CAPS6 @CAPS7. These sites are not boring. This a whole lot of fun! Whoever thought that learning would be fun? I sure didnt. The time is now! Just think that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends because no matter what, people will always have time for that.",4,4,0
203,"Dear Newspaper, I think people need computers. It helps them see the world if they can't. It can be used to send important messages to people that are farther away from you. Also if someone has a parent or loved one far away they can see each other through the computer. So here is examples of these three things. Some people can't physically or mentally and can't afford to travel. Its sad how some people are so sick with a disease or illness that they can't go places. But if they go on the internet they can look up pictures and information of places they've never been to which can help them see the world better. But there are people who can help them see the world better. But there are people who have fears which prevent them from travelling to different places. So thet could go to the internet and find ways to help them get over their fears. Which in turn will allow them to get over their fears and let them travel to places. Then there are people who can't afford it. So the internet can help find a good job that pays good money which they can use to afford to travel the world and see it for what it is. What if you need to send a really important message to someone to prevent them doing something or help them live or even stop a war. So take into reconsideration if there is a war going on for a miss understanding. So if the government figures out what happened and they know how to straightin out the situation then they could send a message to the attackers. What happened and that it wasn't what they thought we did then they would stop fighting and the war would be over. What if a bomb is in the white house you would want to get out of the building or find it and disarm it. So then a guy finds out about it and send a message to the white house and that would save all the people in the white houses lives. Sometimes loved ones go away to some where far away and you can't talk or see them. Someones in the military and he/she has a kid so the computer allows them to see and talk to them through a webcam which would keep the child and parent together and not seperate them. Also you see a friend in facebook who you haven't seen in years so you friend him and you guys get back in touch with each other and you can be friends with them again. So in conclusion the computer can do many helpful things. It can fix relationships, save lives, help you get over fears and see the world. Which isn't bad sure we sometimes go over board with it but it is very useful. It isn't horrible but it is sometimes bad but also sometimes good but",5,5,1
635,"Dear @CAPS1, @CAPS2 of late there has been controversy of how Computers affect people's lives. I believe that the effects on people negative. My main reasons of this argument are. The persons health their the users well being. Did you know that over @PERCENT1 of kids and teens are obese @NUM1 computers can contribute to this statistic. If a person is eating unhealthy but sizing. They can still be fit but if they go on the computer instead of working off all the. They become fat. This can be a serious problem. Becoming overweight has many health risks liked heart other. It also could prevent a person from excersicing. If they are overweight their legs could ache and a simple set of stairs could become a huge challenge. Do you want in obesity rates? I would think not. If you watch tv you could picture perfect families. We all know that no family is like that. Introducing computers could mess up that fact even more. For example, my cousin used to be an outgoing friend person. Now because of computers he is a @LOCATION1 who does nothing else but play on the computer. He gets up eats breakfast. (The of about ), then plays on the computer untill lunch. He eats a small lunch and right back to playing. After along @NUM2 to @NUM3 more hows of playing. He off the computer, hopps into goes on his laptop all night. This greatly affects his family. They try to get him off but all he does is online. He cant interact with his family and this has a huge infact on it. Even though he could get off and talk one of the only ways of talking to him are through facebook. Now because of this family is. We can easily avoid this by telling every body these known facts. My final argument for you is the users well being teen many of us have a facebook of @CAPS3 I have homework I to use the internet for facts and stories. @CAPS3 I do so to go on facebook. If anyone dows the effect our grades. If we chat on facebook we doing our. If arent doing our homework we wont get a good grade. If we could less to other serious problems. Another thing is that you could actually need your computer to stay. It could be addicting and you might rely on it ""once a to kill himself because he dident have his computer"". So @CAPS2 you can see there many negative effects on a user of a computer. It could many problems inthe future like health. the family happiness. So spread the word for the sake of thousands of people.",5,5,1
927,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1, I agree with some of the perfesionals that think the computer keeps people from exersising, enjoying nature, and spending quality time with friends and family. Some people thnk it's cool to be on the computer @NUM1 @NUM2. The truth is the computer with internet is like having @CAPS1 at your fingure tips, distractions, and more. You can find just about anything on the internet these days. Some people use the internet for doing homework. Sometimes people can find the exact answers to an assiment. That means they are becoming more dependant on tecnologie. If the world becomes more and more dependent on the of computers and such, that could mean things. the world is suffering because people are neglecting to pick up their trash and to try to stop @ORGANIZATION2. Most people, instead of taking action, will be on the computer. People are becoming more and more lazy these days. As I stated most people are becoming more and more lazy these days because all they have to do to have fun is sit and do little movement. Saying that, people are neglecting to exercise and eat right. They are also neglecting to spend time with friends and family. Instead of texting or @CAPS2 someon try to call them. Or maybe even wehn you're free you can go and make plans to visit with your family. Taht's all I ask is that you especially spend time with family because you can always get more friends or anew computer. But your cant get a new family.",3,4,0

And while there at the computer there not looking at nothing else but the screen and thats not good for anyones health if there just looking at a computer screen the hole time. Another reason why i think at affects people @CAPS1 there not eatin wat they need to eat there just eatin something quick like junck food so they could on the computer. All are this effect stay on the @CAPS1 people either go places or have atheres might not be going out time their effects need to",3,2,0
13,Dear local newspaper I raed ur argument on the computers and I think they are a positive effect on people. The first reson I think they are a good effect is because you can do so much with them like if you live in mane and ur cuzin lives in califan you and him could have a wed chat. The second thing you could do is look up news any were in the world you could be stuck on a plane and it would be vary boring when you can take but ur computer and go on ur computer at work and start doing work. When you said it takes away from exirsis well some people use the computer for that too to chart how fast they run or how meny miles they want and sometimes what they eat. The thrid reson is some peolpe jobs are on the computers or making computers for exmple when you made this artical you didnt use a type writer you used a computer and printed it out if we didnt have computers it would make ur @CAPS1 a lot harder. Thank you for reading and whe you are thinking adout it agen pleas consiter my thrie resons.,4,3,0
1127,"The use of computers has been increasing since personal computers were invented. Although there are some upsides to computers like doing research and interacting with people, there are @CAPS1 more bad aspects then good ones when it comes to computers. Computers negatively affect the way people live outside the ""virtual world."" @CAPS1 people end up overweight or obeise from spending too much time in a computer chair and not enough time outside exercising. People also tend to interact with people on the computer that they don't talk to out in the world, or that they don't know at all. People also give out personal information to people they don't know, which leads me to my second point. Thefts happen everyday across the globe, whether it's robbing a bank, a store, or even someone's identity. Using a computer can lead to @CAPS1 thefts. There are people that hack into people's banking account, which has all your personal information on it, and withdraw any sum of money tha they like. Millions of people have all of their information online, for anyone to see, and this is very dangerous. That is another downside to computers. My final point that is to be made is all the costs that come with computers. @CAPS1 people have to spend a lot of money on glasses because they looked at a computer nearly all the time. Some people even must pay for rehab. There are people out there who are actually addicted to the internet, so they have to pay thousands of dollars to get back to health. As you can see, there are @CAPS1 more cons than pros when it comes to computers. Any of these things could happen to you so I advise you not to use a computer.",4,4,0
1554,"Computers? Have you ever thought of how a computer is made or how every small part of a computer is installed? Well, unfortunately I don't have the answers to these questions but I do have another quistion for you to think about. Are computer's bad for you? Well, I think that they arn't because first of all, they teach us hand-eye coordination, give people the chance to learn about places and people that they have never seen or even heard of, and lastly the allow people to talk to faraway relatives or friends without ever having to go to them. As I was say in before, the computer gives people good eye-coordination. For example people usually are not very good catching a ball at first but of course if you keep on practicing you will get better. Same thing with the computer, at first you arnt very good or fast at typing but if you keep practicing you will gradually get quicker at it. Then this good habit will help you while your at school or at work. Second the computer gives people the ability to learn about places or people that they have never seen or heard about. For example some people might have yet not heard the warter falls, trails, or food's from @ORGANIZATION1. Another example is that mabey some people might not know about the belly dance came from @LOCATION1. or the big dragon came from @LOCATION2. The excelant source to find out all these things in a quick amount of time without having to . The computer is also excellent for elderly people are in weel chairs and can't take too much . Lastly, it let's people talk to far away relatives or family members online. This is better because then mabey a father went on a busines trip to another country and talking on the phone is really satisfying also you can forget about sending letters. It is always nice to greet a father, a mother, or even distant cousin online were you can see how much they have grown. I hope you you have taken my side on this judgement for it is very important to me. Please remember my three reasons and don't forget that this includes you to.",4,4,0
47,"Dear newspaper, I feel as though internet or computers act as an advantage in sosiety rather than a problem. They help with school work, like projects or email. You can even take college online now! People also use the internet for media or to simply catch up with friends. One of the most important reasons to have a computer is for school orenented reasons. Like having a project that you need to get notes for or making a power poin presentation. One other great reson is for the teachers. There computers can help them teach a class in a way that is both fun and easy to undersand. The new uprizing in computer use has brought about new ways of getting a college degree. Now you even just simply get in bed turn on your lap top and take college classes right on your computer! I dont know about you guy's but I'd much rather take college in the own comfort of my home then drive to a campus all the time. Another great use for the internet is e-mail to e-mail makes our lives a lot easier now that more people use it. It can send us school starts like a early dismiste or a way to catch up with old highschool frends. Another great reson for the internet is for mention or just to have fun and relax. @PERCENT1 of people that have computers use them for media or fun reasons, like gamelry, or to go on to youtube. Please add this article into your news paper so that the computer can be put out there as a helping add, and not something that is going to make the whole world obise because thats not just from computers. Its the people who use computers, felt that they dont get exercise not the computers. So why put them out in a bad way.",4,4,0
643,"Today more than @PERCENT1 of our population spends expensive amounts of time each day on the computer. I agree that having a computer in your home is benficial at time, but to me the disadvantages outway the advantages of spending to much time on a computer. Disadvantages such as cyber bullying, illegal websites, the criminals that use the internet to target days, and the interference that spending to much time on the computer has with your grades and other school work. I think that largest number of people affected by spending to much time on the computer are kids. Mostly kids right name from school, drop there backpack, and instead of sitting at the kitchen table or study area to do homework, they sit right down in front of the computer. Then what happens to that homework? It usually doesnt get done. That absence of homework could make an enourmous decline on a students average. However, homework is not the only school work effected by the computer. Even in school kids use internet on their cell phones. This provides a huge distraction for kids and usually ends up with the result of kids not completing the task asigned to them. Not getting work done is not the problem. Computer presents to kids through. It also helps with bullying; cyber bullying. Alot of kids are bullied and picked on the school but then that bullying carries itself to the childs home threw the computer. Once at home a kid can get hurtful emails or instant messages. These hurtful messages @MONTH1 do a lot more than just hurt someone feelings, it can hurt their self asteem and how they feel about themselves. Then as if cyber bullying and not doing homework werent bad enough. there are also criminals on the computer. These criminals prey on kids. They can find passwords to accounts. They can find out personal information about yoo because of how much time on the computer each day. Once they find out enough about you they use to it gain your trust and the problem only escalades from there. Although many kids are affected by the amount of time they spend on the computer each day, there not the only ones. Adults are affected just as much and just as easily. One thing that lvers adults in to spending all their time on the computer is all the ""great deals"" they can find on the computer. But many of these great deals come from fake or illegal websites. Websites that are selling stolen merchandise. Then show you all the benefits from buying from them and then once you believe them and buy what they are selling, they have all of your personal information. From their you can end up with an empty bank account or even identity theft. Does that realy sound a ""great deal?"" @CAPS1 to me the disadvantages of having a computer definetly out way the advantages of having a computer. I think that people need to step away from the computer desk, get good grades, avoid bullying and criminals. Keep there bank acounts full and there identity safe. Instead they should spend time outdoors, with family: or enjoying life!",5,5,1

You can learn about whats happenings in other parts of the world, you can learn things about celebrities, and you can look at the weather.

It is very unhealthy. People in my family that are always on facebook are not getting exercise, and becoming overweight. Eight out of ten @CAPS2 aren't getting enough exercise. We need to get people moving and exercising. Secondly, People need to enjoy nature. Everyone is so caught up in their computers, they don't sit back, relay and take in nature. People don't get that the earth is polluted. Once animals are extinced they are not comming back. If they got off of their computers for a minute they could see the animals before they are gone.

One of them is we need computers for so that we can get around, if your planing to ge some where for the @DATE1 you would look on the computer for that perfect place. Second if you don't know how to get there of corse you can use a @CAPS2 but the computer is the best because it shows the miles and how long would it take to get there so thats one of them. And second to help learn about black history month and famous people, we all know that black history month is in books but not lot of boosks have alot of info in them thats why the computer comes in handy because like on google it gives you more info and shows the image of that person so that you know who they aare, like a famous singer or raper you @MONTH1 like but knows nothing about them you would use the computer, @CAPS3 because thats the best thing to do. Third would be how to find out the news and weather, I if you did not watch the news because you missed it what could you do is go on a news site and watch the news that have been aired on tv, or a favirote show to if you want. Foruth would be besnness, with out computers there busnness would be hopless it would not last that long. @NUM1. They would not knwo there profits @NUM2. how would they monege anything, that would happen if they did not have any type of computers. There lots of more stuff that coulf have said that prove computers are good and why we need them but i just had to cut it short and schools need computers the most to take test on the computers of they have to, so thats all the resons why we need computer and why they are good bye.",4,4,0
557,"Dear, editor of the @ORGANIZATION1. I beleive that computers are good for the future. The world has made many chenges with there technology. I know not spending time exercising is bad but learning about new things cant be that bad. If humans didn't have technology some of us wouldn't have heat or fresh water. We use computers in life. Computers are good for people who use them to learn about the world. Some people who have friends far away can use a computer to talk to them. Or even people who can't talk use computers to talk for them. The @ORGANIZATION2 uses computers to save lives. Computers save lifes in so many ways its scary to think if they were all gone we could all start dying. We use computers in hospitals if there weren't any computers the chances of finding a cure for something would take to long and the person could die. Lets say someone has what looks like a normal fever and you just say thats what they have. Two days later they died because they had some disease and no one knew until it was to late. We use computers to purify water. We use computers to keep us warm during winter. We even use computers in libraries why the library. Some people who have medical illnesses and can't talk have these little computers that can have something typed in them and it would say it. Most people use some kind of computer to talk, chat, and text. They might find it easier with a computer. The worlds a big place and many people don't know much about it. But if you go online you could find out stuff that you @MONTH1 never knew exsited of just plainly didn't know about it. Kids even use computers for school and school work. So many people rely on technology to get through there life. Computers even help people in school for people like me who broke there arm and have to take some test on the computer. Like me. Now so many things in the military, airforce, and @ORGANIZATION3 are computerized. The miltary uses thermal sights on guns and tanks so they can identify people in even the most craziest weather. It could even locate a wounded soldier. There even working with computers to make better bullet prove vest so they will be more lives saved in war. The airforce uses computers to talk to people on the ground so they could protect them. They now have planes that can be flown by a man far away and this would save there lives even if it gets shot down. This also alows them to see people hiding and they could tell the people on the ground to stay down or whatever. The @ORGANIZATION3 uses radar to see if there is any boats or submarines coming near them and the have a heads up if there would be an attack. We use this to help with other advances in the future we could soon have a computer that could help out people in far places like were there is a higher poverty rate. Computers save lives, alows communication, and is a good way for research. Computers is what we use to live we need them to survive.",5,5,1
986,"Dear local newspaper, @NUM1 out of @NUM2 students at @ORGANIZATION1 say that they spend most of their time on the computer. I think computers have a bad effect on people because they can cause safety issues, health issues, and ofcourse education issues. With all this new technology, teenagers aren't aware of their surroundings at all. On top of that, they're not aware of what's happening to them. Adults also do use the computer, but not as frequent as us teenagers. It's time now to realize what computers are doing to us and the world today. Computers can cause safety issues. Now more than ever people use where they talk to friends. But, what they don't know is that the person on the other side might not be what they think it is. Lately, on the news we hear of teenagers getting raped or kidnapped because of people who they were talking on the internet was not who they said they were. Bad people are always lurking on the internet, and we need to prevent them from getting in contact with the kids. But, even besides having bad people online, computers can with your privacy. It's possible for computers to give out your information to other people so, we really need to watch out. Computers though not only cause safety issues, but health issues also. Computers play a major part in destroying our health. About @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are overweight or obese. T.V's use to be the issue for people not excercising, but now computers are doing just the same. There are so many things to do on the computer that just doesn't make you bored. That there means that there is no way to from it. But, you need to get up and exercise and computers are preventing people from doing so. It's like it's hypnotizing us because we simply don't want to get up. Computers can also have an impact with your vision. I know that after a long time on the computer I have a massive headache because my eyes just hurt so bad. Also, computers can make people stop talking to each other verbally. Talking and interacting makes us have safe relationships with one another, but computers again are preventing this. Besides interfering with our computers do the same with education. Computers can really be bad with our education. Students now easily forget to do homework. There are so many distractions today that than of them whom people spend a long time on it, we forget to do other things that we're suppose to do simply becausewe're distracted. But, eventhough we forget our homework, we also @MONTH1 forget to study before a test. This would result in a in high grades. Computers shouldn't be distracting people, but instead helping them. I think it's not the people to not get distracted on the computer because it just has so many interesting features. For example, the internet, and websites like @CAPS2, @CAPS3 @CAPS4, etc. We have so many distractions in our that we don't need more! Computers really don't have a good effect on people. More and more people get computers everyday. They should know what its doing to them, and what's happening to the world around them go outside and enjoy nature? Maybe, go to the mall with friends and. There are a variety of things to do rather than staying glued to the computer the whole day. People need to stop being and open their eyes to see the effect computers have on people.",6,5,1
1602,"Dear editor, Computers have a good effect on humans. The reason is because you can interact with friends and family that they know, the computer @MONTH1 be portable so you can still get outside, and lastely people can research places where they want to go on vacation. These reasons are how computers have a good effect on humans. To begin with, seeing people in person is not the only way to communicate, on the computer there is many ways. There are chat rooms, that have typing to eachother. Take my friend @PERSON5 for example, he used to live in @LOCATION2 with all his friends and family until buisiness came along. His buisiness transfered @PERSON5 all the way to @LOCATION1. Thank god he had a computer, because other wise he would not have able to communicate with his friends. @PERSON5 is not the only person in which he is transfered far away from home. In fact, @PERSON4 showed @PERCENT1 of people with a computer tend to talk to friends and family more often because they can do it whenever they need. Gene a phsychyatrist states that when someone in a family has to leave to go on buisiness, then that family will start relying on a computer to communicate. Do you want to lose a friend or family member? Moreover, computers @MONTH1 be portable. If a computer is portable then you can see nature and still use the computer to get the job done. Take my cousin @PERSON2 is a teacher and always has to do his students grades during the weekend. He was bummed out because he could never get outside. So for his birthday, he got a portable computer, this allowed him to go outside and do his job while getting fresh air and seeing nature. @PERSON2 is one of many lucky people that has had this happen to them. @PERSON6 has shown that @PERCENT2 of teachers buy portable computers so they can see nature and get fresh-air while doing their job. @PERSON1, proved that if a teacher doesn't get any fresh air while doing their job then they can make a valuable mistake or even get sick. Would you, a teacher, want to get sick with no fresh air or be healthy working out doors? Lastly, there is more to do on computers than doing work and communicating with friends and family. You can research places for vaction. My aunt @PERSON3 had always dreamed of going on vacation but couldn't find any information on fun, outdoor places. Until, she got her hands on a computer. This way she found a fun place and left the country for week. @PERSON3 is not the only person this has happened to. In fact, @ORGANIZATION1 shows that @PERCENT3 of people hesitate to go on vaction because they don't know about the country or place.",5,5,1
1517,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @CAPS3 a computer is a benefit. They help us in so many ways. It is very helpful, it could make someone's life easier to handle. You could keep in touch with old friends or family. It would be easier for work, and when you're bored, you could play some fun games. It's very hard to have family you can't see and keep in touch with! With a computer you could send messages and photo's to interact with them. You wouldn't have to worry about ever losing communication with them. You could also meet new people. Get new friends from anywhere in the world! Have friends from all different race and culture. Computer's are a great way to interact with others, whether its family or friends. It's always had to do work when you have no clue what it's about! if your ever @CAPS3 trouble on something you could always look up information about it. You could learn how to do things or learn more information about a certain item. When you have homework and don't know the meaning of a word, you could always look up the definition of it. They also hold your information. For example, instead of @CAPS3 a ton of papers you could simple just save it in your computer. Then you could print it out whenever you need it. Computers make work easier and help you organise better. Computer's also amuse you as well. When you have nothing to do, you could play alot of fun game's. You could also watch music video's or funny videos to get you laughing. They have practicly anything you want to play. You would hardly ever get bored! As you see, computer's are a benefit to people. It's always helpful when you could keep in touch with anyone, have help with your work, or simply keep yourself entertained. Without computers life would be harder and boring!",4,4,0
1216,"Dear @CAPS1 @ORGANIZATION1, Computers are an extremely usefull tool in this modern age. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to easily learn about faraway places and people, and allow people to talk online with other people. Therefore, I believe that computers have a positive effect on people. Hand-eye coordination is a very important skill for young children to master. Without it they will have sloppy handwriting, absolutely no chance at sports, and much more. Computers help teach them because they need their finger to hit the same key that their eye sees. And because they tend to want to type faster, it will help even more because the finger and eye will have to work in mission to type faster. Computers also give people the ability to easily learn about far away places, people, etc. People used to have to spend hours searching for a half decent book on a topic, and then find the specific information they need in the hundreds of pages. Now that information is only a few clicks away. Say you have had problems with your faucet, it keeps drippy but you dont want to pay for a plumber. You could easily step by step instructions on what to do using the computer, the possibilities are endless. Finnaly, Computers can allow people to stay in contact with friends who @MONTH1 live far away. It is more convinient than using a plane because you dont have to have something in your hands the whole time. You can walk away and then came back when you hear that you got a message. It is also very usefull for people such as buisnesmen because they can talk to multiple people at once while still being able to get other work done, @PERSON1, author of buisnes magazine tells us in an iterview that it is nearly imposible to run a succesfull buisnes without a computer. How people could possibly say that computers have a negative influence on society, I dont know. But I hope that you will publish this in the paper and show them that computers are necesary.",5,4,1
1777,"Dear Newspaper, Computers have advance a lot since they were first made. Some people see computers as a way to rot your brain, while others see it has a learning device. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away places and allow people to talk to each other online. To start off, computers are bad because they can be used as a way to babysit a child. When you're on the computer you're just sitting there staring at a screen with pictures and words on it. Some parents use the computer as a way to keep their kids quite, instead of taking the time to go outside. By growing up in an enviornment like that the children only know how to play on the computer. Kids have a lot of energy, and they need to do something productive, not play computer games and talk to their friends. All school day they talked to their friends, they need to be with family doing something to keep them fit and healthy. By using the computer as a babysitter, you as a parent are leading your child to obisity because all they do is games, and they aren't properly taking care of their body. On the other hand, computers give people the ability to learn about far away places and people. If your teacher gave you a last minute writing essay on @LOCATION2 that was do in a week, what would you do? You can't fly to @LOCATION2 and ask the @CAPS1 people what you want to know. That would be a waste of time and money. And if you go the library and they don't have any books, then you're in trouble. But by using the computer you can find endless information about @LOCATION2, and you could finish that essay in a day if you wanted to. Also, if you were going to @LOCATION4, but you knew nothing about @LOCATION4 you wouldn't be very confident about going. And you would feel like a tourist. But, if you went online and searched @LOCATION4, you could find the traditions, the clothing, and so much more. Lastly, if you wanted to know more about a famous person who isn't around anymore, you could go on the computer and find pictures and what they did, how they became famous, and so on. Finally, computers allow people to talk online with other people. Say your grandma lives in @LOCATION3, and you can't call to often because your phone bill will get to high, what do you do then? You talk online since you both have computers and it won't cost you to call. For example, my grandma and grandpa both live in @LOCATION1. When we call there it costs a lot because they're so far away. When they got a computer, we each bought a webcam and called them everyday on @ORGANIZATION1. Now, not only did we talk to them, but we also get to see them too. If your friend didn't have a phone and you really needed to ask them for the homework, you could go online or on aim or facebook and ask them. You know you can always get an answer because everyone is always on the computer at some point of the day. Although computers have a negative effect when it comes to children, they have more of a positive effect because they give people the ability to learn about far away people an places, and they allow you to talk online with other people.",6,5,1
276,"Dear local Newspaper, I believe that computers are bad news. Most kids come home from school and go on aim. So they can talk to their friends. @PERCENT1 of @CAPS1 are obiese. I feel it is better to play outside with your friends than sitting in a chair playing on the computer. If kids go outside and play with their friends they will have more fun. Also kids will learn how to interact with each other by playing outside together. The kids will see more nature and be bale to learn more about animals. When kids are on computers they are sitting their doing nothing. ALso some kids post pictures of themselves on things like facebook that are not appropriate and cna get them in lots of trouble. They also say things that they wouldn't normally say to a persons face. The computer is simply a way for kids to get in trouble. Whne your outside palying baseball, football or tag with your friends you are getting exercise and your having lots of fun. If you are getting lots of exercise then you are most likely not going to be obies. Some say the computer is good hand eye coordination but catching a football or hitting is bettre. Also some say computers can tell you about far away places but that what school is for. I am saying that exercise and playing with your friends is better than talking in your friends or video chatting with them, @CAPS2 are to many over weight people in @LOCATION1 and the computer is not heloing the cause.

910,"@ORGANIZATION1, In the @DATE1 computers have help man kinds. Computers are every where in a schools, homes band business across a @CAPS1. They help people in many ways depending on the what the person wants to set done. The ways that I use my computer is by staying in contact with my friends, a family, and it also helps me with my school work. I have been a live for @NUM1 @DATE1 and have already live in @NUM2 different states: @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, and now @CAPS2 you would think I would have had lots of friends living in so many places. How do I stay in contact with them you @MONTH1 use? I use various and @CAPS3. If you get rid of computers I would not be able to stay in contact with tem anymore. Moving from place to place was very hard and sad thing to do for me. Another hard thing to do for me was moving away from my family, but thank to technology and computers I stay in contact with them. Imagine you haven't seen you family in @NUM3 @DATE1, well sadly thats my life so many birthday @CAPS4 all the family you can see is you parents. School another great example where society benefits from computers students and teachers use them everyday to learn. In my opoion learning is the greatest thing. One of my friends, @PERSON1, said this about the dell computers we use in the library @CAPS4 ever u don't get something about what we learned in @CAPS5 class that day. I use the computers to better understand it. Computers are a great way to research a topic, and thats why they should not be gotten rid of. I use computers every day for two reasons for school, researching or writing a project for any of my classes. Everyday I spend at least @NUM4 our writing something up for school. Computers help lessen the time spend writing it because it is fast and easy it is easy to type something, like a @CAPS6 paper on the ways to persuassive the readier. In the end computers are something we I need in are life because it makes life simpler. If I was to send a message to some of my friends in @LOCATION2 through @CAPS7 it would take seconds. Instead if I was to use the @ORGANIZATION2 it would take days. A life with out computers is a lot harder to do things, that we cant make simpler with computers""",4,4,0
1694,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, I think that people spend way too much time on the computer these days. They get less exercise. Don't get to enjoy the nature around them, and they don't get to interact with their family and friends! If people stop spending so much of their day on the computer, then they wouldn't be having too many issues. People need to spend less time on computers, and spending more time exercising! Computers all over the world do not involve much interaction with any part of your body other than your hands. You don't tend to want to get up or do anything else when you're on your computer, right? Well that needs to change. Often, peolple get cranky while they are using a computer or if they need to get off of one. Some people are so obsessed, they might even break down and have a fit! Nobody want's to see someone throw a fit because they have to get off the computer do they? If they don't get exercise anytime when you're not on a computer it can deffinately shows. Jimmy @CAPS2 syas, ""@CAPS3 @NUM1 kids are on their computers way to much! They never come out of their rooms, and if they ever do, then they are normally very cranky. They're getting fat! I can tell because all they eat is junk food. This needs to "" @CAPS4 can't even have a little of time with his children. They should go on a family trip and enjoy together! That brings us in next issue. We all need to enjoy nature more. Why would you spend your time on a computer looking of pictures of nature when you have it right there in your . It's because kids are too lazy to get off their lazy and go outisde. The best thing about nature is that if you are  about need to be alone or even just need to get , nature is always there for you anytime you need it. You can laways go otside with your friends and family too!. I'm sure that they would apreciate people getting off their computers to spend some quality time together. Yet again, our next and final issue. Computer obsessed teenagers and adults need to be with their family and friends. When talking to your friends why bother talking to them on the computer when you can just get together and go do something fun? ALso, when you spend time with your family, it brings them a lot closer toy ou. Nobody likes to not talk to the people you love and the people who reised you. When you're on a computer I just think of all the places you could , place you could be with. Nobody wants to be distant from their friends and family. Therefore, people should turn off their computers, go exercise, be around nature and have some quality time with their friends and family. Thank you",5,5,1
734,"Dear newspaper, This year my school and a cop come into my school and tell me and my peers about the dangers of online. This has made me believe that computors are not beneficial. Computors are not beneficial because they enforce bad habits. Plus, websites and some applications are dangerous. Also, they are very addictive. Computors have a bad effect on people. To begin, computors enforce bad habits. For example, some websites are bad websites that say mean things about other people. Some kids @MONTH1 join in on the cyber bulling because other kids are kids @MONTH1 give in to peer pressure because they want to get accepted by their peers so badly. Furthermore, someone @MONTH1 agree to meet someone they don't know. That can be scary because you do not know if this person is really someone you thought they were. Recently, I read a magazine and it had an article in it about people going to meet other people they online. Most people found at that it was not the person they thought they were. Finally, the computor enforces bad habits because people @MONTH1 send someone some questionable pictures to someone else. As I mentioned before, when the police officer came to our school he talked about this. He said that people were sending pictures of them that were innapropiate to other people. Those other people would send it around and in the end it was a horrible mess. I'm sure if computers didn't have a giant effect on people, this would not be as big of a problem as it is. Computors do not only cause bad habits, but they are also dangerous. I'm sure if you listen to the news you will hear stories about child predators. I think that is one huge problem. If computers did not have such a on people this would not be a problem. In addition, computors are dangerous because kids @MONTH1 choose to make bad decisions because they do not knew. For example, many kids who are on myspace or facebook have not talked to their parent or guardian about internet safety. Or maybe even their parent or guardian isn't monitering them to make sure they are safe online. In conclusion, the computer is dangerous because feelings could be hurt because of myspace, facebook, a blog, a video, or maybe even more. As an illustration, one time one the news I heard a story about a girl who was tensed on the internet. She felt so bad that she committed sucide. I found that horrible. A person should never comitt sucide, especially because some other person could not be nice. To sum up, computors are very dangerous. Computors are also addictive. To start off, it makes you spend less time with your family. (not finished!!!)",5,5,1
1784,"Do a adults and kids spend to much time on the computer? Well I donÂ’t think they do. Sure they use it a lot but still it's for enter to inment. Kids need to use the computer because it's another way for them to communicate with each other. Textings good but it costs money, so does to lking on the phone. If a doesn't have texting they can go on facebook or something to make make plans to do something with a friend. What if it's a rainy day outside and there's nothing to do? Well that's what a computer for.Kids use the computer for entertainment. There's tons of games to play. All on different websites of course but that's beside the point. There's mmorpg or rpg those are two type of games I can think of computers are like kids own virtual outside world. Computers are also needed to do research for school projects. Also to get pictures. Sure there book but they don't always have everything you're looking for. You can't cut pictures out of books. You need a good grade on a project.

39,"Dear local Newspaper A lot more people uses computers daily but not everyone agrees that it benefits society. Those people who supports advsnces in technology believe that computers have a positive effect on the people and I agree on some circumstances but looking at the situation cleary I dont agree due to the fact that its better not spending to much time on the computers. First because its way better excercising, @CAPS1 enjoying nature and lastly interacting with family. @CAPS2 why I dont agree that people should be in ther computer more their doing things better in life. First, becacuse it's useful to exercise. Talking a walk around the nieghborhood of just going for a hike with people you know. Even better going to the gym its such a better way to spend your evening instead sitting infront of a computer doing nothing but to look at a screen all day and plus exercising makes you stay in perfect fit, healthy and strong for as long as you live. A computer can just kill you not in reality but sitting all day only on the computer eating when you feel like it and no exercise that is whats going to kill you and make you become so lazy to do nothing. I know nobody would want that for sure. @CAPS1, enjoy nature live life the way it needs to. Gods creations of nature is the must beautiful thing in this world dont let it go all to waist. Jump off a waterfall or go to the park let the wind hit your face. Make imaginations become real and just enjoy what natures about. Third and last, interact with your family and friends. Spend time with them and watch movies or any sports channels. Go with them for some ice cream. Dont let them feel left out or unloved. The mall is a great way to spend time with your friends or family also going to water parks like six flag or lake compound of place like nomads or chuckie cheese its a great way places to spend and interact with your family and friends it also can bring closer as well. This is why I think sitting infront of a computer screen all day, first its a waist of time when you go do some exercise or @CAPS1 enjoy nature or lastly interact with your family and friends, @CAPS2 why sitting infront of a computer as a waist of time and negative why to spend your days of living life. Technology holds you back from the real things in life. Thank you for reading my letter and hope you take it in consideration. Good day!",5,5,1
755,"Dear local newspaper, I strongly believe that computers have a great and beneficial affect on society. They have @CAPS4 many features. options, and abilities to use! Would you really try to prevent your child, friends, and families from using such an amazing invention that helps us every day? The computer can help others communicate, help educate you, and even prepare you for the future. One great option that computers have is the option to communicate with others. You can set up an email or a chatting account to talk with friends and family. Now some people might think, ""@CAPS1 not use a phone to talk to others."" @CAPS2 these are many reasons @CAPS1 talking online can be better than using a phone. I remember one time a few years ago. Me and my cousin @PERSON2 were alone at her house when the phone wasn't working @PERSON2 went down stars to get us some sodas when I heard a crashing sound, @PERSON2 had fallen down the stairs. Because the phones wren't opperating, i hopped to the computers in her room to quickly ""chat"" with my dad and tell him what happened. From these on, my dad called on ambulance and @PERSON2 was allright. @CAPS4, not only are computers a great way to communicate, but they can also save somenes life! Another feature computers have is that they can actually educate. For example, if a stuident has to write a paper for school about the @CAPS3, then they would need to do some research. The internet explorer on your computer can open your eyes to a world of kodedge. All you have to do is go to a search engin such as @ORGANIZATION1 or @ORGANIZATION2 and type in the subject you wish to learn more about. Before you know it, there's millions upon millions of websites that can educate you on the subject you want to gain more knoledge on. @PERSON1, a high school teacher, states that ""@PERCENT1 of students in the school use the computer to help them with homework and reseacrh."" @CAPS4, there you have it, the computer's a great resource for information. One last reason computers are @CAPS4 beneficial for our society is because they can actually help you prepare for future jobs. Perhaps some day your child will get a job working in on office where they must use computers all day long. The heard of the company is not going to hire you if you are not expierenced with computers. However, if you know how to use a computer @CAPS2, then you have a great chance of getting a job that can support you and your family. Studies say now that ""@PERCENT2 of buisnesses involve using a computer"" Computers are becoming a bigger part of society by the second, it's important start learning more about them as soon as possible! I think now it's very clear how important computers are in our society. They help increase communication, a great source for knoledge, and bhelp prepare you for jobs. With each passing day, computers help advance the future and help make the world a better place.",4,5,0
1328,"I believe computers are a good thing for several reasons. Three reasons why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. You can also use them to meet new people. Finally you can also use them for planning. My first reason why computers are good is that you communicate with other people. My parents use e-mail all the time. They taly to my grandparents, then friends, and even use it to arrange events with other people. My use it when people are hurt and I know some people use it to learn about magazine subscription and other thing to buy. My favorite thing is that my parents use e-mail to talk with my grandparents about my birthday presents. My second reason why computers are a good thing to have is that you can use them to meet new people. I know there are alot of websites that match you with someone based on what you like and do. You can also use e-mail to talk to friends and they @MONTH1 want to see you again and you can meet people that way. Therea are thousands of ways to meet new people. You can use chat websites or you can use sites like facebook or myspace. My third and final reason why computers are good is that you can use them to plan a vacation or move dining reservations. For example me and my family went on vacation to @LOCATION1, and my mom made all the reservations from our computer at home. My parents aren't the only ones. Many people travel dening vacation, and propbably @NUM1 out of every @NUM2 people use a computer to reserve hotels. I also wanted to take you to the other side without computers. If we don't have computers we would have do send mail through the post office and by the time that gets to your house someone could have new baby could have been born. Plus we would also find up doing bills and taxes without computer software. My parents life and my life would be very hectic if we didn't have computers. Once again I believe computers are good and that more than half of america use them. I believe this because you can use them to talk to other family that @MONTH1 be far away. You can meet new people through online dating services. Then theres the always helpful panning part, so you go online and reserve a hotel on dinner at a resturaunt. Plus if we didn't have computers we would have to do bills and taxes the old fashioned. My where you add up and subtract and divide. It's alot less words if you use a computer.",4,4,0
336,"Dear @CAPS1, ""@CAPS2 at @CAPS3 killed in a horrific acident"" is the title that flashes across the screen. Then another, and another. What is supposed to be @NUM1 minutes grows into an hour or two that take away from your family. I can see why this @MONTH1 bring up many conflicts; as computers can be very helpful. However, I feel that more often they negatively impact the general public. For one, there are many sites out there that portray false information. Plus, computers begin to consume the rest of peoples' lives. When it comes to these technological devices there are pros but there the cons can easily outweigh them. To start, computers are loaded with viruses, scams and internet predators. So easily someone can steal credit and information by placing offers that seem ""too good to be true."" @CAPS4 you listen to your instincts, then you'll know that they are. But, many people who don't know any better fall for these traps. In fact, @NUM2 out of @NUM3 people have been scammed some time in their life I can clearly remember when someone. I know thought they were buying a pair of boots. Later That day, they got a call from the credit card company warning them about the purchase. These days you have to be so careful when you're on the computers. When my friends and I were learning about evaluating websites in computer processing class we came upon a site that seemed reliable, and accurate. We were all shocked when we learned that everything about it was fake. Computers can put people who @MONTH1 not know any better at risks. I strongly feel that sites like these and many others have a negative impact on the public. in addition, computers steal much of peoples' time to the point where family, 'doing homework and exercising is limited. I can understand the effects of too much exposure to computers because I see it everyday with my younger brother. Once he begins his video interactive games, homework is pushed a side. The only words from his mouth are, ""@CAPS5, just one more game!"" I suppose you can infer how this turns out: one game, turns two and so on. It isn't only children either. Many of my own friends are update status or pictures on @CAPS6 for three hours every night. Isn't their a point where we can draw the line. between going on for ten minutes and letting the computer control your life? When surveyed ;the majority of students said that they spent at least two hours on the computer every night. When games and instant messaging starts to take away from studying and exercise there is a huge issue. Computers take away peoples' free time and can negatively impact their grades and fitness. So, I ask you to consider the benefits of computers; but also look for the negative effects. You will realize that their are more than you would believe. Support me on this by limiting usage of computers and by helping the public see the dangers that these technological devices @MONTH1 bring. Computers can harm relationships, finances and your personal life more than you would think!",6,5,1
484,"Although most people would say the invention of a computer is a good thing, I dissagree. There are many bad things about the invention of computers, they give access to the internet.

Although something on a social website such as @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 might say a person is fourteen years old, @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 might be someone that had just been released from prison and is actually fourty years old. There is never a way to know if its safe to talk to other people on the internet. Games on the internet are also very bad. Games are one of the causes or obesity in america. Also, games on the internet cause kids to be drawn away from their families. Another reason of why games are bad is because you can become addicted to them, and stare at a computer screeen so long you get eye-strain.

Thats the beauty of computers and technology letting you do alot of things with only using on device. Thank you for giving me the oportunity to say my opion and what I think. I hope you take my letter and into consideration.",4,4,0
1665,"Dear @CAPS1, Advances in computer technology have positively affected the society we live in today. Computers teach hand-eye coordination, help kids learn inside and outside of school, and connect the world socially. These amazing devices have done nothing to harm the new generation. In fact, they have done quite the opposite. Computers are an excellent way of teaching hand-eye coordination. People who are opposed to using computers believe that all they do is make kids lazy and ignorant. This is not the case. The coordination gained from using the mouse games over to sports like baseball and lacross. Players have to look at an incoming ball, and guide their stick or mitt to catch the ball. As you can see, coordination is essential to sports. It is also needed for simple every day tasks around the house. These could be as plain as just taking out the trash or cooking meals. We overlook the fact they easy jobs like these still require coordination. A misplaced pot could pour boiling water on the floor and cause a huge mess. W are lucky that we live in a world with such a good teacher of hand-ey coordination. Computers are the worlds most knowledgeable teachers. No matter how hard you try if you are using a computer, you will learn something. The internet is a best cache of information. In the current day and age, the environment is a growing concern. Paper no made from trees, so must be cut down. It takes forty years for a tree to grow, and seconds to cut one down. Schools everywhere should use computer and keyboards for work instead of paper and pencil. Since most students are familiar with computers, they enjoy working with them more than writing. The average kid could learn more in an hour with a computer than they would whole day at school. The transiton needs to be made. Computers are also a massive social network. Instant messaging and @CAPS2 are now primary sources of communication. If it hasn't for computers, I wouldn't be able to talk to my friend that moved to @LOCATION2 two years ago. This is just one example of how social networks are helpful. They help people stay connected with old friends, and work. All major corporations use computers to invest, sell products, and store information. Computers are the ultimate way communicate. Obviously, computers are growing exponentially in popularity. The @LOCATION1 should put this to use. Imagine a more eco-friendly country where we don't have to cut down a million acres of @CAPS3 @CAPS4 rainforest every year. The benifits of computers are endless. Three of these are hand-eye coordination, knowledge and communication.",4,5,0
1420,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1, @CAPS2 has come to my attention that there is a massive increase in people using computers in society. @CAPS2 can have its positive effect on people, but too much of @CAPS2 isn't a good thing. This is why I want to tell everyone about negative effects of the computer on people. We all know using computers helps people with all different kinds of things. They can help with business, interacting with family and friends, and you could even just use @CAPS2 for entertainment. Some negative effects that some people don't know, or maybe just ignore, are things like they can keep you from exercising, exploring nature, and you could spend so much time on your computer, that you could get addicted. There should be some way of telling the people that this is happening and is a concern. So I think that we should try to combine what people like to do on computers, with what they should be doing more often, like exercising. Maybe we could tell people that they can use their computers to contact people like friends and family to go out and make plans to exercise and have fun outside so theyre not stuck on the computer all day. We all know that computers can be a good and bad thing. They teach hand-eye coordination, give people the ability to learn about places and people in the world, and so much more. They also have bad effects, but that doesn't mean we should take them away from people. And you shouldn't be outside all the time, for the whole day. So I think there should be a limit on how many hours people spend on the computers per day. This way, people get what they want, and they have some time off of @CAPS2, too. Obviously as a result there should be something done about this computer concern. I hope I have persuaded you with my well-thought out thoughts and ideas. And hopefully they will lead you to an idea that will end in a helpful change in society.",4,4,0
1169,"To middlebury paper, @CAPS1 the article on wether or not computers benefit society, my opinion is that they have lots @MONEY1 pros to make them a worthwhile thing to have in our towns schools, homes and businesses. They can help more than they hurt, and can you honestly see your life without checking e-mails and keeping up to date with our society? Computers in schools help to increase the amount @MONEY1 learning our children. @CAPS1 example, @PERSON1 can study their math facts online @CAPS1 math or learn about the skeletal system @CAPS1 health classes. It also is an advantage is conserving money because instead @MONEY1 having to pay @CAPS1 your son or daughter to fly to @LOCATION1 to learn about the collisreum, you can let them learn about it on the internet first, to see if the trip is actually worthwhile. Also an essential thing needed to life is hand eye coordination, and a way to practice that is playing exercise practice games on a computer. Thats help install the coordination your towns children will use @CAPS1 the rest @MONEY1 their ! Educational benefits will only increase as technology, so cutting children from it now is a big mistake! With computers, communication is a . Students can get homework through their e-mail. Saving time so they have more time coming up. The cost effectiveness computers because instead @MONEY1 paying @CAPS1 phone bills and tutors @CAPS1 your children and cellphone bills, you can just talk through e-mail and potentially save @MONEY1! Keeping in touch with families is simplified also because in just one e-mail you can catch with all your family members! Speeding up communication with computers clearly has benefits no one wants to miss out on. So why would you make that mistake. @CAPS1 addressing you can't place the blame on computers @CAPS1 why people don't exercise people as much. People choose how community they exercise, on the computers. Computers don't control wether you family or not. If anything they help together! Spending time in nature is that particular persons. Choice no one elses. All these cons can't be blamed on computers, because its the people that decide how much they're used, not the computer. All in all, I think keeping our use @MONEY1 computers where it is now is the best idea, because without it communication and education will decrease and with that, who says exercising will increase?! Overall the choice is the computers user, not the computer, so when used in discretion, computos contribute greatly to society.",5,5,1
1542,"Do you remember school projects sitting down bored and watching your @CAPS1 stations or sitting in the doctors office waiting bored out of your mind? Well no more! Since the computer was invented there have been many many advancements and all of those things are gone. There was once a time when the only way to do a project on a country was to look in the paper untill you found something now with computer advancements you can enter a country's came into google, a search site, and up comes @NUM1 things on that country. In fact @PERSON1 a expert on computers and inventor of one of the most advanced computers on earth says that searching for information is now @PERCENT1 to @PERCENT2 eisier depending on the topic. Also you no longer have to work a redundunt type write that always makes mistakes that you have to retype. You can just use @ORGANIZATION1 and you type your essay. Anything speelled wrong is underlined in red so you only rarely have a spelling mistake. As a result of this increase in knolage, from a learning stand point computers are extremly good for mankind. My second reason that computers are extremely good for us is that they are entertaining. On your new laptop you can go on miniclip or addicting games, both gaming websites and play games. These game while not only are fun improve handeye coordination which helps with sports, driving, writirs and many other things. More advanced gaming computers called consoles such as the @CAPS2-box @NUM2, by @ORGANIZATION1, the @NUM3, the @CAPS3 by the @CAPS4 provide exteme gaming experience. One of the more recent games for these consoles is called @CAPS5 of @CAPS6! Modern @CAPS7 @NUM4. This game has an online system where you can talk to and play against people all around the world. Not only that but advanced games such as @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 improve eyesight. Studies show that playing a high action game @NUM4 hrs a day will improve eyesight more than eating @NUM6 serving carrots a day. My final reason that computers are good for you is that they take boring waits. If you've everyone to @CAPS10 you know that the lime can be @NUM4 hrs long. People used to wait that just standing there. Now people can pull out their @CAPS11 or @NUM8 player and listen to music. The @CAPS11 can take videos and pictures as well as play music, videos and games. If you are lucky enough to have an I touch you can check email, stocks, weather and news right on your @CAPS13 as well as buy songs which can be @NUM9 cheaper than @CAPS14. In conclusion all of this advantage in technology benifits us greatly. We can now learn about new exiting things have fun while improving eyesight and we don't have to wait.",5,5,1
1424,"Dear @CAPS1, I belive that computers benefits the people of today. The invention of the computer had helped people to send messages and information to each other, helped students with school and allows children to have something to do when they can't go outside. Let me explain. The computer had created easier way for people to send messages and information to one and other. Before the invention of the computer, the only way to pass on information was by mail or phone. The computer sped up this process. In fact, people had recived information about @PERCENT1 faster with the invention of the computer. I was once able to send my friend an email about getting the homework faster than writing him a letter. Clearly, computers made it easier for people to comunicate with each other. Also, computers help students with school. Before the computer, a student had to use a type writer to type their papers. Using a typewriter, when they made mistakes which was on, they had to start all over. It;s a completely different story now. In fact, a study done by the board of ed. shows students write papers so faster and better with a computer rather than a typewriter. I remeber my grandfather told me about how he typed papers. It took him about an hour he typed papers. It took him about an hour and a half to write a paper on a typewriter, while the longest it took him was a half an hour on a computer. As you can see computers have helped students all across the . Lastly, computers supply kids with things to do while they can't go out side to enjoy nature. Many people would that kids would go on their computer when they were able to go outside. A study done by the @CAPS2-obesity shows that @PERCENT2 of kids would rather be outside playing and excersising than in their house on their computer. But sometimes, during certain weather conditions, kids aren't able to go outside, so they myt entertain themselves indeers. A study done by @ORGANIZATION1 shows that mere the @PERCENT3 of kids go on their computer when they can't be outside. If suddenly those kids lost their computer privleges, many of them will have little to entertain themselves with. Clearly, the computer occupies the time of kids who can't go outside. In conclusion, the computer has enormouse benifits on society. It allows people to send messages and information faster, helps students whith school, and gives kids something to do when they can't be outside. I hope that this letter had convinced you of the benefits of computers.",5,5,1
1656,Dear @CAPS1 In my opinion the computer is the better thing because you can do alot of stuff like play games. My three reason why you should have a computer is you can talk online with your friend or do homework or project and fine out @LOCATION1 things out. Therefore I think if you like doing that then the computer is what you need. My first reason is talking online. People talk online so they can talk to there friend @PERSON1. If you talk oline you can figure out what was homework or whens the meeting or the time the party starts. You can also talk online with your friends or family the moved or lives far away around @LOCATION2. My second reason is doing homework. Sometimes you need the computer to do your homework. You need the computer so you can print picture for your report. You wil also need to type yout report on your vaction. The computer also help you fine the history or @CAPS2 book online so you can do your homework or project. My third reason is finding out @LOCATION1 things. You fine out how old is @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or how tall is @ORGANIZATION1. You can also figure out how to spell a big word. You can fine out many hallway can take you to @LOCATION1 or @CAPS5 beach or other places. Fine out where the wall of @LOCATION3 is. In coulsion if you like to learn @LOCATION1 thing or talk online and do other stuff then you should get a computer.,4,4,0

140,"Dear editor, I have heard that some experts are saying that @CAPS1 spend too much time online. I thoroughly believe they are mistaken. With the use of internet people can learn about faraway places without spending money to go there. Our military uses internet to talk to their family and friends stateside. Also it helps us aquire great hand-eye coordination. If someone was planning a trip to @LOCATION1 they would check the internet often. Firstly, they would check out sites to go to in @LOCATION1. Second, they would check and compare hotels in @LOCATION1. Thirdly, they would check the weather in @LOCATION1. Finally, they would check airports for flights going to and from @LOCATION1. Without the internet planning vacations would be close to impossible. People not only use the internet for pleasure but for communication purphases too. They use web cams to talk online to people in faraway places. It is fast, free, and convinent way to communicate to other people. Our military uses web cams to let the soliders talk to their families. How would you feel if you were a solider fighting for you country and the means to talk to your family is out there, but you could not use it. It is cruel and unjust to keep soliders from talking to their families. Internet also gives us something usefull. It helps us build hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye coordination is used in many things. In basketball you need to be able to look up and dribble at the same time. When you are driving you need to be able to look up and still be able to steer the car. Without hand-eye coordination many more accidents would happen from carliess errors. Internet helps people make the world a safer place. In some aspects the experts are right. We should go out and enjoy nature, but we also need to enjoy and use the internet as well. Some people use it as pleasure and build hand-eye coordination. Whle others use it to talk to their loved ones. Or use it to plan vacations. No matter who you are or what you do internet plays an important part in life.",4,5,0
1091,"Dear editor of the @CAPS1 @CAPS2, People say that technology is affecting everybody left and right. Computers actively help us with our daily lives. It helps us do project for school, let us understand culture around the world, and gives us the ability to talk and connect with friends and family everywhere. Our shool makes us do tons of project and the computer is our main course. If you want to go somewhere far away, you're most likely to research it, and then plan on going. It is also might be used to talk with friends on facebook, twitter, and @CAPS3. Computers help us learn and communicate. To start off, as an eight grades, we are prepared to go to high school. Fortunately, it means we do projects, reports, and research on the computer. The computer enables us to find information for a project, or construct a diagram or data table for a survey. Many people use this method for jobs. People do reports on celebrities and famous people from history. Books can't always give the information you are looking for, so they look up that persons name, and they will find our hundred of web sites that give information and photographs of that person. In addition to, computers let you book flights, buy, tax rates. Sometimes, people don't always to go and drive to a local car, so they go online to a website that sells, and they are able to look at all of the features of the car, the price, and mileage. The only way you can get tickets is if you go onto the internet. They have websites that let book whatever kind of flights you want. It can be to go to florida, or it can be a flight to @LOCATION1. If you also how the economy is doing, you can look up tax rates and how find out how much our country is in debt. You can even find out how much an average family pays - every year. Computers can be very they resourceful at @CAPS2. It gives capability to do more than you can imagine. Most importantly, computers have created a way for you talk to friends and family around the globe. Facebook and twitter are the new things of the century. Facebook and twitter let you talk to friends, post photos and talk about your personal life. They have a new thing now where you can play lifestyle games. @CAPS3 is not as popular anymore and doesn't have as many cool things. It only let's you talk to friends and that's why no one uses it anymore. People want to be able to do more than just talk. It comes to my attention that computers have over time. Computers these days enable you to talk with friends, do research and projects, and let you book flights and buy cars. Our school's curriculum has many projects and reports. They can be done only by the help of a computer. You can research people and places and or get pictures. You can also book flights for far away trips and buy cars and other items off the internet. We even have the capability to talk with friends on facebook and twitter. Computers have a positive influence on people.",5,5,1

572,"Dear leader of the local newspaper, I have heard the strange misconception that computers are ruining our society. I for one, think that this is a terribly made thought. To begin, the internet (provided with most home desktop computers) can teach us a lot about the world around us. Additionally, the whole fact of contacting others around the globe, as well as having a whole fun world to explore, makes computers more enjoyable. Finally, thousands of jobs around the world are either based on or work with computers. Due to this, computers are , without a doubt, beneficial to society. The first reason I need to clearly point out is that the computer holds tons of information that can't be found anywhere else. While books have to be republished as updates occur in the world, anything on the internet can be updated almost instantly, beneficial to students with school projects for subjects like @CAPS1, subsequently, people could actually go to school via online schools and colleges. Whilst regular colleges could cost around thousands of dollars in order to get in, online colleges are much rather cheap, affordable to anyone. Also, due to the high amounts of information online, schools seem to be growing obsolete as computers typically hold all information obtained in a regular school year. Because of this, computers are definately beneficial to society. To build up, the internet provided with computers can bring loads of pleasure to those who use it wisely. Because of the growing population of those who use computers, companies tend to make computer shoes, which usually attracts viewers by the thousands each day. This makes television seem obsolete as well. Another major thing is that software comes out for the computer almost everyday, allowing many things to be done by users. Software typically includes games, movies, and music. Finally, since staying in touch with others is a good thing, chatting with others across the globe is very easy and durable, allowing distant relatives to come in contact with you via various chat programs. Due to this, computers can bring loads of fun to users, and are thus beneficial to society. Lastly, due to the rising demand of computers, companies typically rely on computers for jobs. Since the internet population is growing, companies allow people to fill out applications and send in resumes in order to apply for a job in said company. Also, some jobs can only be done while online or using a computer. Many jobs these days, typically banks, rely on using the internet most of the time, and some actually are based in the internet. Because of this, workers can finish the job easily in one place, instead of having to around and going to a boring looking building to do a boring job. With this reason, why doesn't anyone else see why computers are beneficial to society? With all of these reasons, I hope you see why computers are beneficial to society. Education just become a whole lot easier thanks to the internet. If education is not what you seek, you can then use the internet to have fun when you are bored. Finally, jobs can be completed even easier, and makes workers more responsible. So, leader of the paper, do you really, along with everyone else, think that computers are a waste of time in life?",6,5,1
1175,"Dear people, Computers have been here for not a very long time and everyday more people buy computers and everyday people use them. As they are used for entertainment, education, and talking with people faraway, they have had a negative effect on people. Let me explain. First of all, as people use computers in the beginning they enjoy it. They go on the @CAPS1, play games, and use it for work. But as they keep using it, they start to get addicted. People are addicted to computers because of the games and being able to go on the @CAPS1. In fact, @PERCENT1 of all the people in this @CAPS3 who owns a @CAPS8, is addicted to computers. That percentage is expected to grow to @PERCENT2 in the next @NUM1 years. Addiction to computers lead to serious issues. People have died because they spent too much time on the @CAPS8 without eating and sleeping. In another newspaper not long ago, it stated that a student attending @ORGANIZATION1, was dropped out for doing so poorly during school. His parent found out that he was addicted to this game ""@CAPS3 of @CAPS4."" This game is right now the most played game on the @CAPS8 in this @CAPS3. Studies state that @CAPS8 addiction is almost as bad as smoking addiction. My second reason why @CAPS8 has a negative effect on people is because of online bullying. People chat on @CAPS5, @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and email and people are bullied. A friend of mine recently was emailed with words that hurt his feeling. Online bullying is worse that inteacting bullying. That's because @CAPS9 you say something on the @CAPS8, people don't know who you are. @PERSON1, a proffesor who recently did studies of online bullying says, ""Online bullying has become more severe than contact to contact bullying. People are threatened more and hear more bad words than interacting."" The online bullying and harassment is going to get worse @CAPS9 people don't stop. Also people can get arrested for what they write online. My final reason why computers have a negative effect on people is that people spend too much time on computers and don't exercise @CAPS8 contribute about @PERCENT3 to overweight people. On the @CAPS8, everything is much easier. Instead of mailing, you could e-mail. You can listen to music instead of walking up to the radio and turning it on. You could buy tickets, shop, talk with friends, and have fun just by sitting on a @CAPS8. But this is why people become overweight and obese. @PERCENT4 of the people who use computers are obese or overweight. Peole spend less time interacting with friends and family and enjoying nature. In conclusion, computers have a negative effect on people and parents should control their child's time on the computers. Just because of a @CAPS8, many issues rise. So @CAPS9 you think you are addicted, try to make a time schedule for your whole day. Use the @CAPS8 for an hour a time and take rests before using it again. Addiction, online bullying, and becoming overweight is not the only problems of a @CAPS8, there are many more.",5,4,1
1292,"Dear local newspaper, I have some arguments to tell you how computers aren't all bad. One you can use them to get information for a project, talk to your friends, or learn about something you have never known before. My first argument is that most people use there computer to get information for a project they have to do for class. For example, they could need information for a country like @LOCATION2, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION1. There are many way you can get this information. So if you didn't have a computer where could you get all this information. If you get it from a it might not have what you are looking for your project. Had the computer here a bigger range of knowledge then a have. My second example, is you can talk to your friends you haven't seen or talked to in a long time. There are many ways you can do this On @CAPS1, @CAPS2, twitter, yahoo. You could always because it is always better to make new friends. Even better to a family member. I know it is alot better to talk to a family because they already know you. Finally, it is always better out something you never knew before or something you have been wondering about. But you could always go on google, ask or wikipedia. They can all help you you have been looking for. But that doesn't mean you can't find it in a book either. They are chalk full of answer and ideas that can help you. My conclusion, is that you can always find ways to get the answer you need. But that also doesn't mean that you should be sitting on the computer when you could be going outside, or playing with our friends. And nothing is better then spending your time outside. So use the time on the computer better. Then go out side and enjoy the outdoors.",4,4,0

672,"Dear whomever it @MONTH1 concern, @CAPS1 name is @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and I think that the effects that computers have on people is not good. I think this for a few different reasons. Those reasons are that because of them noboby goes out, people; especially students loose penmanship skills, and people loose their desire to do normal everyday things. They make us lazy!! Because of computers people don't go out. They don't go for walks because their doing something on the computer. There is now no reason for anybody to ever visit a store of any kind because you can order everything online and have it delivered right to your front door. Also, for a lot of people, they don't even have to go to work. They can work for whatever company right from their home computer. People can even finish highschool and college on their computers, by taking online courses! That brings me to @CAPS1 next reason for computers haveing a bad effect on people. Students, can now type out all assignments, some schools even give laptops to students to use throughout the year. Being able to type out everything would mean that students would barely ever have to pick up a pen or pencil, makeing their handwriting worse from lack of practice. Another way computers have a bad effect on students is because of the internet. You can find any and everything on the internet, from math books to dictionarys and other resource books. Because of this some students don't even know how to look up a word in the dictionary, let alone find needed information in a book. I think this gives students a wrong idea and sence of reality. When they go to work, not everything will be done on a computer, but this is all they are being taught to use. Lastly, people are losing their desire to do everyday things. Why go out with friends when you can talk to them online? Why go out to dinner when you can order it online? People are starting to see no point in going out and doing things because there are ""more important things"" to do on the computer. I personally think they are brain-washing us and pretty soon the world is going to be one giant computer. Based on everything I just said I don't think computers have a very good effect on effect on people. They are makeing the world a very uptight and controlled place to be and based on that selected information, I'm sure you can see why.",4,5,0

1481,"Dear Local @CAPS1 @CAPS2, I would wont computors because it benifits our society. It helps on learn about countries around the world and whats going on. For example if you wanted to no about it's sports, you can just type in name. Also a computer can help you with your education. If you were working on a homework assingment and you needed some help you can just go on the computor. It is also very benifial because student can have lots of fun playing games on the comput say like it's a cold rainy day and there is nothing to do, a kid can get some entertainment by going on the computer. It is also a good way to communicate with you friends. For example, facebook, @CAPS3, twitter, and email one all good sources of communication. Also it is good for if you have a xbox or a @NUM1 you need a computer you need to hook up a card to your computer so you can play online with your friend. It's good to have computors in school. Is teachers want some students to go on a website to learn something it is a very helpful source. It is also a good in source because in school if your working on this big project a computer can help you do it. I hope these one all good reason to have computer in our society, and it will benifit us in a number a differnt ways",4,3,0

I talk with my pen pal from @LOCATION2 almost all the time with vidio char, the most popular websites today are social. For example facebook, myspace, and twitter, thease days @PERCENT1 of people have an account on at least one of thease websites and that number grows everyday. @CAPS1 live has made vidio games a lot more social. @NUM1 in @NUM2 kids are playing with a friend they know while playing @CAPS1. By useing computers your hand eye coordination will increase significant key hand eye coordination is used in a lot of sports. ""I don't know if I'd be @CAPS2 good of a tennis player without useing a computer to boost my hand eye coordination. ""@PERSON1 you can use hand eye coordination to do stuf faster. I can copy notes so much faster because I can write and look at the bord at the same time. Wheather you relize it or not hand eye coordination is very inportent computers can improve hand eye coordination by @PERCENT2. People can use computers to learn online. When you go on the internet you can learn about cool places and plan vacations. For @DATE1 break me and my dad used the internet to learn about @LOCATION1 we then decided to go there and bought tickets. You can learn about interesting people in history. There are over ten billion articals about famouse people in history. On the internet you can also learn new resipys if you are a cook. ""@CAPS2 an @ORGANIZATION1 I learned most of my cooking online."" - @ORGANIZATION1. Online you can also learn how to improve your technice in sports. Before I joined the swim team I looked up on the internet how to improve your swim technice and how I qualifyed to go to @CAPS3 with my team because the internet inproved my time by two seconds wich was enough for me to go.

535,"In my opinion having computer is good to have. Therefore I think having computers are a good thing because nowadays computers are very useful. Also a lot of people are using the for there businesses. My there reasons are to look up information, home work, and to talk to friends and family online. My first reason is to look up information on the computer. If you have thred reports to do it will best to use a computer to look up the information because it will be easier and faster to do. For an example using the internent will be faster then looking for it in a book. For that it will take at least @NUM1 to @NUM2 minutes for the interenant if you were to lookingit in a book it can take at least @NUM3 to @NUM4 minutes. My second reason is to you could talk to your friends and family online like if one of your relatives live long distance like in @LOCATION2 then you can talk to them on your telephone or cellphone because the bill will outragouse. Or if you talk to your friends online so can ask them a question on homework or whats the homework? Like if you have a that to like @LOCATION1 you can to online and you can talk to them. My third reason is that you can even do your homework on the computer. If you have history you can go on a website for an online book instead of bringing a book to school and back to home. Also it will be easier for that you would not have to worry about bringing your history book with to home. For the example it will take less time using the interneat the using a book it will take like @NUM5 to @NUM2 minutes using the computer then using the book for @NUM5 to @NUM8 minutes. In my conclusion using a computer is very useful and very important nowadays. My three reasons are to look up information, homework and talking online to friends and family. Even though people don't like computers or don't like to use them.",4,4,0
1028,"Dear Newspaper, @CAPS1 you know that two out of three @CAPS2 own a computer? Computers are a very helpful tool that benefit everyone in society. They allow people to communicate with eachother, learn, and teach hand-eye coordination and other good things for school.. Computers are a very useful and beneficial part of society. The advance in technology has upgraded computers, and now allows people to communicate through them. For example, new webcams allow people to actually see and talk to each other from you computer screen. This allows people no matter how far to talk to each other and stay in touch. With my webcam I am able to keep in touch with my cousins in @LOCATION1. Another way of communication is through email. Through the internet, people can type messages back and forth. It is very fast and easy allowing people to talk to each other more and communicate. As well as webcams and email computers grants people access to communication websites such as @CAPS3 (instant messaging) or @CAPS4. These websites people message each other back and forth very quickly and easily. It is not difficult to do, like writing a letter would be, so people can communicate more efficiently and easily. Computers are very helpful for communication along with @CAPS6. Computers are an advancement that could help people learn more about anything. For instace, they could learn about foreigh plaus. All they would have to do is go to the internet, type what they were @CAPS5 for, and it would come up on the screen. It would allow people to learn about places all over the world. Also, people can see pictures on the computer. For example, if someone wanted to go on vacation faraway, they could type in the place and see what it looks like. However, the computer does not just show places. People could also see animals, other people, the environments, and anything else they want to learn about. Plus, with new websites being created, people could actually see what the earth looks like from space. They can look at houses, the wonders of the world, and much more computers give people the opportunity to learn about so much more. @CAPS6 more would help people, especially students to have a better education. If you ask anyone in school, they will tell you that computers are a very useful tool. Firstly it allows them to type. Students can type a project or paper on the computer faster and easier. It will also look neater and more orginized. Plus, computers teach students hand-eye coordination. By typing or even just clicking the mouse, students are bettering their coordination. This is due to the fast while they are @CAPS5 at the screen and typing or clicking, they have a sense of direction and know what to hit or where to put their hands without even @CAPS5. Lastly, computers help students because if they need help, they can just ask one of their friends through the computer. Students would better understand the content they are @CAPS6 and when they go to school, they would already know it. Therefore, computers would lead to students getting better grades. Computers play a big role in society today. They are a way of communication, @CAPS6, and allows students to do better in school. Overall, computers are a very beneficial tool in our society.",4,6,0
856,"When you are using technology usually it is work related. A computer is used for work to write essays, make power points, and research, when people use them for facebook, myspace, @CAPS1, and other chat live oovoo and websites it is more for their pleasure. I only go on facebook when I am checking my schedule for hockey, most kids use it for talk. Then there is oovoo & online video chat used for talking with friends but why not just callem'up. When I think of facebook or oovoo, or even myspace it makes me think of inapropriate pictures kids, and adults post. I think that is very unhumane and that is very dangerous to post ot because once it's out there you'll never get it back. For instance I am always outsided hanginaround when it's warm out, during winter I can understand going on facebook, but during the @DATE1 there is no need just go outside and have fun. Kids wonder why they gain weight we'll if you'de get off your computer, and quit eating twinkies then you'll notice you just have to be active. some kids parents don't really give a flying faldoodle what their kids do all day. They don't care if their kid is @NUM1 lbs. at the age of @NUM2. They don't care if their kids are sitting on the computer eating all-day. If i could tell you what it must feel like to be a couch potato I would but I never go on the computer unless it is for homework. I used the computer just @TIME1 I typed up all of my homework except for my math. I didn't play one game, I didn't check email go on the internet or anything I just worked my hardest and got it done. I conclude this with the fact that using a computer is not a bad thing, using it repeatedly and not exercising is. A computer shouldn't need to be used for pleasure it's not created to do so it's created to keep your life simpler. People pay money to buy a expensive computer and motem and all that expensive technological accesories, to make their lives much simpler not anywhere in thes essay did I say to play games because it's not. Playing games can be done outside, it doesn't have to be inside, and definately doesn't have to be on a computer. To make everyones life easier kids, get off your lazy butts, get off the twinkies, and stop playing on the computer. ",5,5,1
290,"Dear reader, @CAPS1, people have been debating whether or not computers are actually benefiting society, especially now that the majority of @CAPS2 now own one of these helpful machines. Computers help people with everyday tasks and are no doubt doing more good than harm. Imagine how impossible it would be for most people to do their jobs without them life would become much harder for the people living on this planet. Think of the successful schools in our country, and then think of which of those schools don't have computers. Computers are the easiest way to look up information, something important when children are learning. Whenever someone needs to know something, they just google it. This comes in handy when researching for that huge project due next week. People have never been so knowledgable. Computers are only important for school, but also in the work place. They serve almost the same environments. Now that computers are so common, people can conveniently type up a paper and submit it to their boss or teacher. It saves time and effort with a more professional result. Computers also serve the important purpose of communication using email or instant messaging, one could communicate with someone on the other side of the world without that enormous phonebill.Some @MONTH1 see this as dangerous because you could be chatting with a complete stranger. However, it is also opening your eyes to new cultures. Now it's possible to learn about life in @LOCATION1 first hand. If computers were no more, it would be extremely hard for a regular person to interact with someone from another country. It's almost like isolation from the world. There are many out there who take great interest in learning other languages. Better ways exist than sitting in a classroom listening to someone talk. As a person on this planet, do you really want to be kept separate from others just because they don't live close enough? A main concern about computers is that no one will want to read books and anything else. However, a recent study shows that after computers came out, more people have begun to read. This proves that just because there is now something fun and new, it doesn't mean everything else is trash. People will still continue to do things they always did, just with something new on their list. In addition, it is the option of everyone w/ other or not they want to spent their time on the computer. If someone doesn't like the idea, they've no right to take it away from someone else computers were created to help the human race not control it. If a person doesn't want one, they don't have to get one, everything is up to them, and that is the way it should remain. The next time you see a computer, don't think of it as some sort of obsession that's keeping people from doing other thinkgs they could be. But as a universal device that allows them to broaden their horizons and learn things they probably wouldn't go to the library to look for comuputers aren't holding anyone back, but pushing everyone forward, whether at work, school, or even the house, they benefit everyone, everywhere.",6,5,1

370,"Computers are becoming a household item in the @LOCATION1 and around the world. There is a problem through, because some people believe that computers don't benefit society. In my opinion, computers are a @CAPS9 thing for our everyday lives. The internet allows us to communicate with friends, family, and more people around the globe! Its various programs help keep files and other things of that nature organized and updated. Finally, computers are a @CAPS9 resource when researching for projects, reports, homework, or anything else that requires information to complete. The world is a large place with many people, places, regions, and countries. Families sometimes move far away from their families and friends, so they want to keep in contact. Post is a very slow and costly service, while the internet is cheaper and quicker! IM's, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, use one of these fast and cheap ways. They allow you to send a message and receive a message on any day, at anytime, in any place with little of no hassle involved. Another way is to use websites like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4, which allow you to update your ""status"" on your wall so everyone on your friends list can see or comment on. The final and last way is by using a webcam, which enables you to see the person on the other end of the ""call"" and you can also hear their voices. This is the best way, in my opinion, because instead of sending text and pictures they can explain everything in their own way with no limit on how much they can say. Many people have noticed that the world is not an organized place. Computers help organize it with their many applications and programs like @ORGANIZATION1 apps, @CAPS5, and document folders. @ORGANIZATION1 is a chain of apps for everything from writing documents to making spreadsheets to making presentations and even to making fliers for special events. These apps are the basic to starting up a business or promoting an invention. @CAPS5 mainly centers on keeping information stored an organized in files however you wish and is @CAPS9 for quick access to them. My parents and other adults I know always say ""organization is the key to success"", so @CAPS5 definetly helps. The final and most basic way that computers help for organization are document folders. These little things come in handy when you need to save something quickly bu want to keep it organized. All you have to do is name it, click save, and bada bing bada boom you're done! Most importantly, computers come in handy when researching for projects or something else that requires lots of up-to-date information. Books will take a few days and you only have @NUM1 days to research, create, and organize your project and data. What are you gonna do now? You could hand it in late, but then you'll yet in trouble. Here is where the fast and reliable internet comes in if you need to know the difference between @PERSON2 and @PERSON1, use the search engine @ORGANIZATION2. If you have a question about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8, use @LOCATION2. Anything at all that you @MONTH1 need is at the tips of your fingers, with a little help from your computer and internet of course. In conclusion, I would like to state that computers aren't a good thing for society, they are a @CAPS9 thing for civilization! From communicating with friends and family around the world to organizing our everyday lives and helping us research important topics, the internet and computers are a @CAPS9 way to help out our lives in my opinion. Wouldn't you agree with me?",5,5,1
368,"Dear @CAPS1 @PERSON1, Computers have helped us in many ways. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs and computers have helped law enforcement as well. Yes, i, agree some people do spend too much time on these machines, but that doesn't mean they haven't helped us. Computers help children and adults learn so much. Children can use their computer to re-search homework they're doing or even just research thing for fun. Most adults have been through school and are educated but computers help them make discoveries about space, the human body, etc. So not only are computers teaching children, but they're part of making new discoveries that need to be taught to children. Right now our economy is not doing to well. A ton of people are out of jobs and can't support their families. But imagine how many more people would be out of work if we didn't have computers. @PERCENT1 of our society works with computers. An that means @PERCENT1 of the people won't have jobs. Computers not only give us knowledge but they give over half us catch the members of society that do wrong. Computers have helped catch law enforcement for a little bit more than @NUM1 years. Yes, crime has gone up in the past years, but computers have helped us catch criminals. Computers store massive amounts of data, which means we can story already arrested criminal's finger prints, pictures, @CAPS2, previous record, etc. to help us catch criminals. So yes computers have helped us in more ways than one. Computers have helped children and adults learn, increased the amount of jobs, and helped law enforcement. Even if people spend too much time on thse machines, it's their decision and look how much computers have helped us. Make the right decision let out technology continue to edvance.",4,5,0
961,"Dear @LOCATION1, Have you ever found yourself thinking about the computer, or wishing you were on it? I heard you were looking to see if computers have negitive or positive effects on society. I feel that it is a negative effect because of less time exercising littele time with family or friends, and is very it's easy to became addicted to. Exercising, a very important thing for a healthy body and mind @CAPS1 have a hard enough time finding time to do this. So instead of that free time to exercise, they will probably be on facebook. Also the maintenance of the computer will take away time for exercising. Just @DATE1, my computer got a virus I had to get fixed and that took for ever. That time while I fixed it could have been valiuble exercising time. Another key point to look at is obesity. We should be up and moving not just setting and staring at a computer for @NUM1 hours at a time. I love to spend time with my friends and family. I mean who doesn't right? Computers only away from that kids well be on facebook instant of eating a nice meal with thier family. My @CAPS2 always told me stays of the (and stupid) things he @CAPS2 with his friend. Now wkids just @CAPS3 easy. We will never have the social our parents I feel if is very important to spend time with and family because you never find when your going to lose them. Addiction is a serious matter. being addicted to the computer is too. Our generation is so dependant on computers. For example, in the car with the @CAPS4. You just plug it in and it ells you where go. What happens when it braker? You will have know idea where to go because you never learned how to read a map. or what if your computer brakes? You will have to send a better by mail kids had be typing instead of writing. that skill would be lost and you would have to learn it again. As you can see, addition is a no laughing matter. Once again I must streach the negative affect of computers to. ",4,4,0
729,"Dear local newspaper, I think that computers are a great thing to have. For instance they are entertaining, they have communication, and they help make designs. My first reason is that computer are entertaning. I hate to go look at nature. But I love to play videogames on my computer. I still get my exercise though, because I go out and play basketball then play on my computer. The computers are still a good thing though because after @CAPS1 done with basketball, hanging out with friends, or if its raining I like to play some good old gun blasting computer games. My second reason is that you can comunicate with computers. I love to talk to my friends on facebook. You can just login and talk to anyone in the world. There is also video chat you can actually see someone who is talking to you from anywere. Plus email is great for work. You can send information from one computers to the other.

In todays modern world, you can call some one, text someone, or page them with computers though, you can do even more, with a webcam, you can video chat with people, and send each other videos. You can also connect with your friends on facebook or myspace. Sociologist @PERSON2 sais that more and more people are connecting to @CAPS1 websites, and talking with their friends. ""@CAPS1 websites are great"" @CAPS2 also said ""@CAPS1 enable you to talk with your friends when their far away, or you just can't see them. However, nothing beats real connect."" Computers also help us learn. They can answer almost any question you have, and have name a lot. Today, most people don't . Some people still might think that computers are bad for you, and they cause lack of excercise, but I beleive people have the to make friends. They choose to over use the computer, and too much of any thing is a bad thing. Computers today are an invaluble of life, and are irreplaceable.",4,4,0
1167,"How do you think the world would be without computers? I think it would bring us back a couple of ages. We need computers for communication and to learn things that need to learn.

Communication is one of the greatest things about computers. Teenagers love to @CAPS9 @CAPS10 eachother when there at home because its so fast its like really talkiing to them. @CAPS1-@CAPS2 is another thing people love to use. Bosses of companies use @CAPS1-@CAPS2 to send @CAPS10 to everyone so they're all on the same page. There is also a new video chat were you can talk face to face with someone and see them from the other side of the world if you wanted to. You can also learn all you need to know on computers. They have dictionary sites, history sites, encyclopedia sites, etc. You can find any certain time in history and have a whole site on it. Or a site called wikipedia you can look up a certain thing and get a whole web page dedicated to the info of that object or person. Schools also use sites to help students have their knowledge. They have math sites, english sites, @CAPS3 studies sites, and (a science teacher favorite) @CAPS4 @CAPS5 for everything you need to know about science. They also have lots of websites for help with a new language. There is a recent program out caled @CAPS6 @CAPS7 that is on the computer but teaches you any language as well as any human teacher. Some people still say its not enough. They say you still need exercise, nature, and time with your family. You can still do all that on computers. You can look up certain workouts that you might want to do. You can search good trails to hike on that are near where you live. They have websites (like @CAPS8) were you can @CAPS9 @CAPS10, @CAPS11 pictures, play games, and video chat with your family members who @MONTH1 be living across the world from you.
