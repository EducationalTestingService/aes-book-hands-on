4358,"We all have our favorite books and some we like others @MONTH1 not. Have you ever walked into the library in hope of finding your all time favorite book that you nearly forgot about, or maby a book a friend recomended to you? What happens when you get there and the book has been censored? Most books we see in our public or school libraries are are bookes that are well liked or are favorites of many. Books open a new world to everyone and should not be taken away.     To begin, I will explain some problems in our libraries. Some people believe the books and magazines in our libraries should be censored and removed from the shelves because it could be offensive to some people because of racial shurs or comments. This is a big problem because most books written years ago took place long ago like @PERSON1 for example, @MONTH1 be considered offensive but, this book gives a glimpse of what was going on in this time period and without it some people would never know what happened and we couldn't learn from those mistakes and make better choices in the future.     Some books that are censored have great educational value. Everyone has there prefrence on books and what some say should be taken away because of what they think others @MONTH1 not. If all books that are bad or offencive were taken off the shelves then eventually we would have no books left. We have the right to read any book out there no matter how horrendus it @MONTH1 be, besides you can go to church and read worse things that are being censored out of our libraries. If we couldn't read some books like many classics it would take educational value away from us all. Think about all the books we have read and learned from that have the possibility of being censored. Before someone gets into a book they should read the informational part on the back to see what it is about before they start to read something not suited for them.     I believe that no book should be censored and should have the freedom to sit on a shelf and be read by anyone who wants to read it. Being censored is not protecting anyone it only makes things worse. If someone feels offended then they shouldn't read it, it's their choice to pick it up or not. Hopefully I have persuaded you that no book should be censored and everyone has the right to read what they want",4,4
3292,"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine has a good view on the idea of censorship in libraries. Most books have ideas and topics that are offensive to one person or another. I believe that books that have something offensive in them should not be censored.      An idea that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensice to the other, and vice versa. Someone who is pro life on the controversial issue of abortion @MONTH1 believe that a book about a teenage girl getting an abortion is offensive and against their beliefs. In truth, the author was just trying to convey how the teenage girl feels and what happens when you go through with something like that. Katherine Paterson said it well when she mentioned that no books would be left on the shelves. If every person felt threatened or was offended by just one book, libraries would have to close because no books would be left. Books on the topic of religion would definitely have to be censored as well because people of differing religions. The @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offensive to someone of @CAPS2 religion, and because of that the @CAPS1 would not be able to be sold. If that happened there would be an ongoing battle about it. Books should not be censored because an idea that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another.     If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall. When authors write books they are pouring their hearts out to us. If someone thinks their book is offensive and it gets censored, the author of the book would be even more offended. Their life's work could go into one book and just because a group of people do not like it, it gets taken off the shelves. I don't know about you but I would rather read a book with an interesting and maybe controversial topic than a book that seems to go nowhere. If censorship in libraries actually happened, many authors @MONTH1 say forget it and not even right anymore. It is very hard to write a book that pleases everyone. Also, attraction to literature would seize. People are not attracted to books that do not have a quality topic that gets them interested. Literature would have an immediate downfall if books were censored.     If books were censored, the quality of learning would not be the same. Books are tools for learning and taking them away would be harmful to education. Some teenagers including me @MONTH1 find some of the material they read-even in school-to be offensive or have a touchy subject. I do admit that reading books for class is somewhat annoying at times, but it will help us in the future. These books have meaning, which is why they are picked by teachers for students to read. Something offensive like a cuss word is not going to keep someone from finding the meaning of the book. The quality of learning would not be the same if books were censored.     A book can be offensive, yes, but one book is not going to ruin someone's life. An important thing to remember is that by taking a book off a shelf, or not playing music because of a few harmful words is like denying the creativity and compassion of an author or artist. One book that is offensive to one, @MONTH1 not be to another. If books were censored, literature would have an immediate downfall and the quality of learning would not be the same. For all of these reasons, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.",4,4
3545,"I believe that censorship is a very debatable subject for many.But I think that I have a pretty good outlook , and a pretty good view on this. In this essay I'm going to give you my reasoning, and explain , and give some reasons why I think censorship is a good thing , and should maybe be inforced heavier.           Censorship. Should books, music, movies , magazines, etc. be taken off the shelf.. I believe that it is @LOCATION1 , and everyone should have their right to read what they want to,  and what they don't . I believe , that if someone want's to read something vulgur , then let them. If they are an adult , it's their choice. I think as far as the child part of it , that no , children should not be aloud to read things that @MONTH1 be vulgar, sexual , etc.           In keeping children away from these vulgar things , they should have,or keep seperate sections for kids, and adults. I dont think that children should be able to have the access, and maybe they won't know about it, or want it. If their parents think it's okay , and want to let them read it, or watch it, or listen to it,  that before they become an adult they will have to get it for them. I don't believe that children should be candy coated, and blind to the world, I just believe that there is a certain extent to what they need to be limited to.           I obviously think that censorship is a good thing. I think if there was more of it, I think there would be less crime. Kids are learning this , they're watching as young as god knows what, thinking it's okay from the start, and are growing up with that picture ,and message ,of them thinking it's okay  . No I am not saying that all kids learn everything from t.v., etc. ,and yes some @MONTH1 argue that kids dont copy what's on t.v. at all . But I think that t.v. , books, and music affect alot of how children view the world.           As much as I love rap music , and movies such as A.T.L ,rappers such as @ORGANIZATION1, even sometimes when I watch, or listen to those things, it kind of makes me feel like being jaded, and kind of makes me feel like I want to have a bad attitude towards the world, it makes me feel like I wanna live that hard life like that. I think that music , books, what we watch on t.v. , and what we read in the magazines , have a big affect. Such as if we watch the news and there's something depressing, it kind of makes you in a bad mood , or sad or depressed.           The media ,music , t.v., books , magazines, etc., affect our mood, our actions, and even sometimes the way we talk, and dress. I am not saying that dressing that more urban feel is a bad thing , I am just saying when you start doing crime, and drugs because of it, it's a problem. I believe that children should only be censored and not adults, because at the point when u reach adult-hood , your pretty much set in your way's, and have a pretty good look out on what you should be doing, and how you want thing's done. Children are still machuring ,and are like a sponge. Censorship , is a very sensitive , and argumentable/debatable issue, but this is just my view, whats yours ?",4,3
3713,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf..' said by Katherine Paterson. Books are used to entertain and even teach readers in certain aspects of life. Not exactly all books are offensive but some are. Those who are, should be taken off the shelfs, especially if it is in a school library. Children could take that offensive or violent book into action. Other children could show the book to other peers. And also, children can get very offended. Now should offensive books be taken off the shelfs?         Children nowadays are being motivated alot. Whether it's through television shows, video games, or even music. On the news, there has been reports about children being influenced to have a gun and hang themselves, etc. Books are meant to entertain readers in a good way and not teach them to become a violent person. Some readers who read such things can turn those words into action. Then the student could be in trouble. And people really wouldn't want that.          Children have a tendency of showing off to friends. If a student sees something offensive or violent on a book, there is a big chance that they will show it to their peers. Just because children think it's cool. Having one person read this could be a problem, now imagine having more than just one, a whole clique seeing this. It could end up in a huge problem, not only for the children and their parents, but also for the school. The children learning these new things from the book can cause the children to use everyday and make it popular. The school can have a bad image from the students. Passing on the information can become a conflict, and people certainly do no want that.           School is not only a teaching building, but also a social place. There are cliques in every school. Within the each person there is a different color, religion, style, and personalities. Children can be easily hurt. If books are being offensive, it can just easily hurt anyone reading that book. Once again, books are meant to entertain readers and not to hurt them. So why even have authors write something offensive in their books? Maybe authors feel the need to add interest in the book and suspense, but not all readers would take it easily. Hurting people isn't a fun thing to do, and people certainly do not want to do that.               So why have offensive books in shelfs? These books can cause children to use it in action, to show it off to other peers, and to hurt them as well. Children nowadays have it hard on themselves, why make it harder. Books are meant to entertain readers, why not just do that. So yes, take the offensive books off and there will be no problems.",4,4
3179,"Do you believe that certian materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, no i do not. it is one thing to censor a book or movie, but to completley remove it is another. I feel like authors, artists, musicians, and writers should have the freedom to write and say what they want. Regardless of who is reading it.     I feel like censorship is wrong. Authors should be able to feel free to express there thoughts and feelings about a subject or topic in any way they like. some times storys cannot be explained or told the way it needs to be without certain words. Wether those words be good or bad i feel like with out them the book that is being read is not all of what it could of been. in my oppionion censorship takes away from certain values or qualitys the book could of had with the original context still in it. and to me that is not fair. its not fair to the author. and is most certainly not fair to the reader who is reading the book.     I know from my personal expierences with reading books that 'yes' i have read books that have had bad language in them. but just because a book has one or two bad words in it does not mean that it should be completley taken off the shelf. For example the book '@CAPS1' @CAPS2: @PERSON1 was an amazing book. I probably enjoyed that book more than i have any other book that i have ever read in my entire life. But that book would not be nearly as good as it was with it being scensored or taken off the shelf for that matter.     All i am trying to get at is that good books with bad language should not be censored just because of some of the words it has in it. because that is getting away from what the over all message is about. Your almost taking the words out of context when you do this. Do i believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? No i do not. Neither should you",4,4
4675,"No i do not figure that. I say that there is some material for adults, teens and children. The children aren't going to want to read the adult books and the adults aren't going to wanna read the childrerns books the teens aren't going to want to read the childrens books but they @MONTH1 want to read the adult books and thats ok. They will be adults soon they @MONTH1 be interested. there is nothing wrong with that. If the parents do not want there teens or children reading that kindf of material then they should go with them to the libary and make them  get you approvial befor checking out the books, magazines or wwhatever it is they wanna read at the time. Movies are the samje there are different materials for each age group some age groups @MONTH1 be interested in other age groups material and thats ok doesn't maen it's wrong just means thetre maturing more and are interested or couriouse let them explore they will figurt for them serlfs if the material is righrt for them or not",2,2
4174,"I feel that censorship in libraries is not needed. There are ways around your child having to be subjected to certain things you don't want them to be subjected to. If you don't want your child to witness certain types of material that is on you, not the libraries. We have libraries for the sole purpose of variety what is the point in having a library if you can't find what you want because it has offended someone. There are ways around completely taking certain things off the shelf if they are that explicet then they can be put in a section just for adults. No I do not belive certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     One reason why it is not necessary to take certain things off the shelf is if you don't want your child to read or see certain things okay that's fine then watch them and see what they try to pick up and read or watch. Your child doesn't have to anything if you don't want them to. It's like saying I don't like this telivision show I never want my child to see it well what are the odds that telivision show is going to stop playing just becase your not happy with the violents,drug use,language, ect. The odds are extremely unlikely. When you don't want you child to see that certain show what do you do you watch them and keep them from watrching it so why should there be any differance when it comes to the books they are subjected to in a library.     Another reason would be the sole purpose of a libray is to give variety  to the people a place where there is something for everyone. Just because you think something is horrible and no one should read, hear, or see doesn't mean that some one else won't like it, it could be someone else's favorite book,magazine,cd, or movie. One oppinion shouldn't count for so much. If you don't like a book,movie,magazine, cd or agree with the content fine your entitled to your own oppinion then don't check it out no one is making you. If they took something off the self everytime they got a complaint about it there would be nothing left. If they were about to try and accomidate everyone they @MONTH1 as well just give up and close all libraries down all around the world because there will be nothing left on the selves.     Also instead of taking them completly off the shelf if they are that explicet maybe make an eightteen and older section. It would solve a lot of problems. Yes I agree that there are a select few books,magazines,movies,ect. that younger people should not be subjected to, but as and adult you should be able to read,watch,and hear whatever you want. That right shouldn't be taken away just because there are children that come to libraries. Every library I have ever been to there are certain sections and if your child stays in the section where there type of books are then they should be fine. Aside from that though an eightteen and older section would solve a lot of conflict.     No I do not belive certain material should be taken off the selves if they are found offensive. There are way to many ways around having to take the books completely off the selves. I don't want to go to a library one day and there be literally nothing left because they took a book off the self every time someone had a problem with it. There is absolutly no reason why we can't figure spomething out to make everyone happy and I think that having the eightteen and older section would be a good start. For the whole i don't want my child to be sujected to those kinds of things then keep your child away for those kinds of things nobody is forcing them to read anything you don't want them to",4,4
3149,"You know when you find a @LOCATION1 book on the shelf and discover that the content in the book are not word that are oppropity for children to read. Or when you go to copy something and you notice a magazine on the table and find out that the cover of the magazine has an image not for the young mind see. Or a movie or music that you see and the content from them shocks you and makes you that they bleep those word. I see it more better to have offensive items such as: books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. removed from the shelves, because those words and pictures will poison the minds of children and children learn from the world around them stuff like will make the child think that's how your suppose to act and talk. Here two example of why they should be remove from the shelves music and magazines.     First, in deal with music children word immate act they see and the words the say. One good example is rap music: their song have cuss words in them and believe me when I tell you this that I have to constantly to kids at my school saying cuss words like the n- and f-word and many more and seeing some boy's underwear, because they think they are being thugs just because they have their pants sagging low. It drives me crazy and make me think why are their parents letting their children do this. In the next paragraph I will talk about magazines.     Second, with magazine some of the images they use on their covers and pages are something that are ment to be seen where children read. an example for this is when I went into my school library's copying room to copy an article from magazine I found a magazine on the table and it show three of the cast members from @LOCATION1 in their birthday suits. I thought what in the world is this doing at my school they should have something like that in a place where kids are in a learning environment. Why on earth did they send this to a school for crying out loud. What do they think it want bother any kids' parent about it that I sure would be furious about it if I found out that my child had a something that at there school.     In conclusion, this is why they should be removed from the shelves so the children don't see them.",3,3
3855,"I feel that it should be censorship in libraries.Children shouldnt be able to go to the library and see certain books if they aren't supposed to.This could save people from getting in trouble and reading thye wrong stuff.     There should be censorship in libraries.I feel that it should be censorship because they already have stores that contain certain things that kids aren't able to buy.One other reason that i feel that it should be censorship is because children will probably read something and take it the wromg way.When you are a kid and you know that there is something that you know for sure you shouldnt be reading or watching,you try your best to sneak and read or watch whatever it @MONTH1 be.Thats why if we had censorship,they wouldnt have a chane to do so.Another reason i say we should have censorship is because libraries are public, and if you have to be a certain age to look at or view something then you should nt have it in the library.     As you can see,these are the reasons that i feel we should have censorship in libraries.With censorship nobody will feel left out and everyone will be treated equally and feel the same.They already have book stores and online site, where u can buy books and movies,and they have no censorship u just have to be a certain age and have a credit card.That way, they are for sure it is okay for you to rent things from them because you have to be a certain age to have a credit card.So with that being said,I feel there should be censorship in libraries.",3,3
3582,Why censore something that someone worked hard on? People put up money and countless amounts of time to write this and yet you want to censore it.See there is honestly no need to censore any thing in the library because there certain sections for certain people therefore this whole conversation shouldnt be going on in the first place.People just like to knit pick about what they can not handle for instense like the word nigger i dont like it at all but i can handle it and therfore i just shut my mouth and suck it up.So I just feel like all the critique and all the imature people just need not to read or dont go to the library but thats only me though.So stop acting like little children the authors want their stuff on shelves and not being banned and raved and ranted about alsoIn conclusion stop being imature and if you dont like it dont read it. Always think to yourself about what your doing before you decside,3,3
3788,"Throughout my life, I have seen many books that seem offensive to me. However, they should not be censored just because they seem offensive. I believe that books that are found offensive should not be censored.     A reason why I think books that are found offensive should not be censored is because what seems offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to another. Classifying something as offensive is an opinion. Unless everyone in the whole world thought that a book was offensive, it should be able to remain open to the public.         Another reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is because in our @LOCATION1, we are given the right to express ourselves freely. If we censored books that are found to be offensive, we would be violating this right. This would not be fair to the people who wrote the books and to those who like them.     The next reason why we should not censor books that are found to be offensive is that if we were to censor every book that we found offensive, we would not have any books to read at all. Books that some people like are found offensive by others. For example, suppose a few people loved the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 series but another person who read it later found it offensive and had it censored. The people who loved the @ORGANIZATION1 series would now find the books the other person likes and censor them. If this continued, we would have no books to read.     Another reason why I believe books should not be censored is because without offensive books, we would never learn from terrible mistakes. Suppose every book relating to both world wars were censored and could not be read. Sooner or later, no one would remember what terrible things happpened and history could possibly repeat itself. Unless having books that seem offensive is worse than having the events we dread happen again, then books that are found offensive should not be censored.     I believe books that are found to be offensive should not be censored because without them, we would be violating the right to freely express ourselves and we would be allowing terrible things that happened in the past to be forgotten. Without books that are considered offensive, we would not have any books to read at all",4,4
3205,"Everyone today gets offeneded daily. So to go to a library and see offensive material on the shelfs is no different than the rest of the day. However, there are those minds, which have not been poluted and influenced by these offensive materials, that should have a right to keep thier minds that way.      One solution to the problem could be that we start rating books and magazines like we do for movies. The material rated for adults gets put in one area of the lirary while the lower rated material is put on display for the public. The higher rated can be put in an area that is not seen everyday by the public, and is kept secret thus protecting the uninfluenced minds and the people wanting said material can still have their way.     Another solution might be to just get rid of the censored material. It, in my opinion and experience, corrupts both the mind and soul, and causes man to be things he is not by nature. Men, who have nothing better to do than to sit and read or look at things ment for inside of marrage, often accoplish nothing of great value in their life time. They are thus a hinderence to soceity. But if they can not accsess the material, they then need something to do to fill that time. In which case they can find a good classic to read or maybe pick up that dusty @CAPS1 off the shelf.     This thus leaves the labraries with a choice. They can leave their library the way that they want, they can put the offensive material in a seclueded room, or they can remove definent offensive material and keep soceity on its feet accomplishing great feats for the next generation to odserve. Thus the amount of offending someone goes down and maybe the library attendence goes up.",3,3
3728,"Society is always dealing with what is appropriate and what is not. We witness things of that nature every day even when we are not trying to. It is the classic argument between two parties trying to prove eachother wrong, what is admissable and what is not. We should try with all our efforts to keep inapporpriate books off of our shelves and out of the hands of the young population.     People can be influenced to do just about anything. There are too many of these tales to pick out even one. The interesting thing is people can be affected by someone indirectly. Whether it be through television, music, or books, man can be molded into something through what they are conditioned to believe.      The influences one encounters can be either positive or negative. As a lowly person who only wants what is best for society, I know that movies with criminal acts or explicit images do not help anyone become a better citizen. It is no different with books. Books that have politically incorrect messages are in no sense better than movies that achieve the same goal.     I am not in any way against reading books, rather I am quite on the contrary. Reading is overall good for mental and social health because it allows us to explore things deep inside of us that are often rendered useless in our fast-paced world. But if one is constantly overexposed to books that are against our very human nature, they should be removed for the good of the people around us. If one cannot find a book to read that is not deemed appropriate, then he or she needs to take a look at themselves. There are millions of books that are not only exciting and stimulating but also can have a positive influence on one as well.     We as members of the @ORGANIZATION1 are already in enough trouble as it is with all our financial troubles and what not. We do not need to add more to the table when we let the population gain access to obsene books that would typically make someone only rebellious to society. If something is making the people of our lands more riotous than it should immediately be censored or removed from society in general. Believe it or not, there are ways to have fun and get a good message across at the same time!",4,4
3584,"TAKING THE @CAPS1 TO @CAPS2      Everyone will read a book in their lifetime at some point in their life.  The author cannot filter through the entire book to remove offensive language, racial remarks, slurs, etc. One offensive to a person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another.  I strongly disagree that books should be removed if they are found offensive to a specific group, person, or community.     Most books are organized in categories by maturity and genre.  The reader should know where he/she stands among these categories, so they will not be offended.  Maturity comes with understanding.            Books are sorted by genre.  Most, to all, times the @CAPS2 takes from the genre.  The era of when the book takes place is also a key factor.  When @CAPS2 an author must take this into consideration.  If the setting of the book was in @NUM1 A.D. the author would not want to use grammar from the present day.  The reader should be prompted on what books they @MONTH1 read before doing so.     From one reader to another, taking the @CAPS1 on what we read is the real solution.  Maturity comes with understanding.  If the reader is mature enough to understand the @CAPS2 then the book corresponds with the age of that child.  This is why I strongly agree that books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive to one person, group, or community",4,4
3011,"Would you want your childern reaing about things that only @CAPS1 know's what? When you go to a library you aspect to learn about @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @LOCATION1's @CAPS4,@CAPS5 etc. Libraries are for learning new things about the world that will later help you in @CAPS9. When you first walk into a library you except to see people checking out @CAPS2 books , or books that catch your eye just by the title. If we find a book is offensive , or will not help better our childerns' future then stand up and fight for their own  mental development.     We must also think of what the childern want to read. They have the right to read what ever they want, as long as it's entertaining to them and they are learning something new. Some books teaches them about the world they are growing up in. There are some books that I would not let my own child read, but I know in my heart that she is learning something that I @MONTH1 not be able to teach her. Those types of books of are what I call, '@CAPS7's'. Those books that can come off seeming offensive, when in the end they are actually, what I call '@CAPS8', helping to prepare them for what is it come. Not every book will be full of rainbows, pretty colors, or pop-ups. They must know that they are some people they have to be mindfull of, and people who are educating them on @CAPS9. They have to learn the difference between what's right, and what's wrong.          Remember the first book you ever read by yourself? I do. It was called 'Of @CAPS10 and @CAPS11'. I read that book when I was @NUM1. Till this day my mother says, 'I tried to stop you from reading that book so many times , it had dangerous wording that an @NUM1 year should no be able to read at that young age'. What she did not know was that; that book had taught me alot about the world back then. That knowledge I had obtain then had helped me later on my @CAPS9.           Some books are ment to be read while some aren't. If you feel your child should not read a certain book then read it for yourself, and then tell your child the reason why they can not read the same book you had just read.",4,3
3501,"There should not be any style of censorship in the @LOCATION1. I am a strong believer that our country is the best because we are allowed by law and the constitution to have our own ideals, likes, and even dislikes. I understand that libraries are a place for all people of all ages, but I do not believe that they should censor what they put on their shelves.      In the US we are known for accepting all different types of lifestyles, and religions; this is one reason I think censorship is against @CAPS1 policy. One of the things that sparked our countries secession from @LOCATION2, was censorship. The @CAPS2 would not allow the colonies news papers to speak poorly of him or his ideas and policies; this is why when the US was formed the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 built freedom of ideals and speech into the constitution.      I do, however, agree with some censorship. The movie and song rating system is a form of censorship I believe to be needed. with out this form of censorship, small children would be aloud to see and hear things they are not ready for. This is also a good way for people to decide if they would like to experience the ideas and language presented by the matieral rated.     I think that there should be a rating system (or explanitory system) present in libraries. Instead of pulling conservercial books off the shelves completly, we should rather put a warning on them. I feel strongly that I have a right as an @CAPS1 to read and experience any type of book, music, news, or picture I would like to see. If we start restricting what we as @CAPS5 are alowed to see, we start loosing our freedom; we become like those who live in comunist countries where only what the government wants you to see is seen. The statement made by Katherine Paterson supports my ideals greatly; especialy 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. This sentence shows that if we start pulling or restricting the things people deem offiencive, there would be nothing left to read or enjoy.     Censorship in the @LOCATION1 is a direct violation of our consitiution. I am a believer in, if it bothers you or upsets you, dont read it. By doing this we can get rid of censorship, and be able to fully enjoy all our rights as @CAPS5. We also allow our right to be informed to be excercised.",4,4
3988,"Books are an extremely important part of literature. Many different people have different views of different kinds of books. Some people enjoy books, and some people don't. Some people are fast readers, and some people aren't. Reading is in individual task. Your reading abilities, interests, and preferences are different from everyone else's.       The main idea here is preferences. You @MONTH1 enjoy a certain genre or topic that someone else @MONTH1 find offensive. But just because someone else doesn't enjoy it, does that meant that you shouldn't be able to enjoy it for yourself? Just because it is in the library, doesn't mean you have to check it out. Just because it is the new release in the book store and everyone loves it, doesn't mean YOU have to buy it. Other people can avoid the topics that they don't like. For example, if the local library took out all of the books that had anything to do with drugs and alcohol, because they found them offensive, the fact that they took the books out, could be offensive to the other people who enjoyed them. Also, some things could be offensive to some people that could be critical to research for others. Then, some people @MONTH1 not have the resources available that they need.     If it is music, movies, or magazines, then it should be dealt with the same way.  People have a choice of what they want to buy and rent. If a certain artist or actor is offensive to them, they should find something else and leave that @CAPS1 or movie for someone else to enjoy. They shouldn't complain about it. How would they feel if someone found their favorite band's music offensive and then no one could rent it from the library or buy it anywhere? Then, people would understand that everyone is different in their own way and not everyone will enjoy what they do.      I think that knowing that everyone is different and special in their own way should show that, everyone is going to enjoy different things at different levels. Every book, movie, @CAPS1, magazine, and any other thing, should be left for people to enjoy and hopefully you can find something you enjoy too",4,4
4328,"No, the books and etc. should not be moved ,because anybody can be interested in them. Someone could come in the library looking for any of them items and can't find it because the library removed them.      First, there will be no reason for removing the books from the library unless more new books and etc. are coming in. Everyone is into different materials, books and stuff. That's why I say do not remove the items. People might come in the library looking for a book that they want. If that person can find it they might complain, or take there bussiness else where. Then the library could start losing bussiness.     Second, if they library start losing bussines it might be forced to close down.Then if the library close down the people who come there often won't have no place to study or work or nothing. What if those people don't have transportation they will not be able to get to another library. The owner of the library can lose money if it close down, because everyone don't have computer's and books at home. They can come do there research and rent books.     Third, some people go to the library for peace and quiet, and the library is there only place. Little children go to the library looking for books and etc. to and if they can't find the book they want they might start crying. If they start crying people who are working can be disturbed. Then that person or people who are disturbed might leave and never come back and thats money lost. Students school's might not have the book they are looking for, and they come to the library and the library don't have it that student won't have a book.     In conclusion, these are some reason and examples why I don't believe the books and etc. should be taken out of the library. Someone can be really interested in them items and they come to the library search for them and can't find them.",3,3
3774,"I disagree that certain material, books,movies, or magazines should be removed that are offensive to some from the shelves of libraries. There are three reasons why I argue this topic. One reason is that books, music, etc. that are inappropiate should not be in a section that a child would go and look for a book. A second reason is that for a child to check-out a book and the book is inappropiate, they should have identification to show that they are of age. The third reason I think that things like that should stay on shelves is because adults have books, movies, music,etc. for them for many reasons.     Ther should be nothing inappropiate in a library that a child can get a hold of. A child should only have things appropiate that they can grab so parents do not have to be worried about the things they child hear, see, or read. There are some libraries that will let a child get a magazine or book, and let the child check the book or magazine out. This is where th problem begin.     All libraries should identitify each child when they check-out a book, magazine, or music. that why movies are rated, so that a parent could what kind of movie their going to be watching. A parent should keep a close eye on what their child read or see.     I think that things inappropiate should stay on shelves, but I also think it shoud stay in the adult section of the library. Childeren should not be able to go in the section for the adults. The inappropiate things on the shelves could be useful for the adults in some cases. There are some material that a  adult @MONTH1 need to help in life.     In conclusion, childeren should not be able to get a hold of  inappropiate material in a library, all libraries should identify someone the inappropiate material,and adults should be able to have this type of material on shelves in libraries",3,4
4715,"Katherine Paterson wrote about the true impact of censoring what is put in a library.  In the quote she mentions how if what every single person finds offensive is removed, eventually nothing is left.  The question of, 'Should library content be censored?' is a largely debated question.  There is a simple answer to this question.  It should not be censored.     Views on what should be censored and why, vary based on type of person and their background.  As Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @PERSON2 made the observation that most people would not think far enough to realize.  The most logical thing is to not censor what works are put into libraries.  As was previously stated, once every person pulls what they deem should not be on shelves, the library will be but a building without books.     To keep children from getting into certain types of literature, movies, and music, libraries could have a section set off within the adult section for these works.  Many public libraries do not even have these types of items that would be so highly disputed for the simple fact that if the library does not even carry it, they do not have to worry about issues.  These public institutions are working for the best of the visitors, and if there are works needing to be kept from the childrens' section, there is no doubt that this would be taken care of appropriately.       The topic of censorship is a very touchy subject to start with.  This goes back to the debate of what exactly should be censored.  The problem with what is 'explicit,' is that there is no black and white line.  Does a book become inappropriate because a teen girl becomes pregnant within the pages?  In some eyes, the fact that a teenager got inpregnated within a book makes it inappropriate, but critics will argue that this is life and to shield the world from reality makes us all blind.  Proper instillation of morals and values on the homefront will help young citizens make intelligent choices, but expecting the world to censor itself for each individual is something that would never be possible.     Censorship in libraries is a touchy subject, but like Katherine Paterson said, if every person in the world removed what they thought inappropriate, there would be no books left.  This truth being stated, censorship in libraries should be stopped before every book is gone.  As the world turns, life cannot be stopped because bad or inappropriate things exist.  It can only be learned that yes, these things @MONTH1 exist, but by using better judgement the whole world can get along just fine without trying to remove everything 'bad.'",4,4
3168,"Picture this: you come home one day after work and before you even enter the house, you hear music blaring from your child's room. As you step closer, you begin to hear the lyrics that go with the banging bass and you realize that that isn't just any music, it's completely unedited, expicit versions of vulgar songs. Now, who would want their child listening to songs that make it seem like drinking, doing drugs, and other various risky activities are okay? I know I sure wouldn't.     Music isn't the only source of offensive material in today's society. It can be found nearly anywhere. In books, magazines, @CAPS1 shows, movies, on the @CAPS2, you name it. All of these are easily accessible by children of all ages. That is why there should be censorship of certain materials, to a certain degree. By this, I mean that if there is a dirty book in a public library, it should only be able to be rented by people who are of a certain age. Just because it's bad doesn't mean that it has to completely vanish from the face of the world. There should just be a limitation on who can view it. That applies to everything that could contain offensive material.      Kids are kids. There are certain things that should be absolutely off limits to them--such as explicit movies, books, music, etc.--as they do not need to know about drugs, sex, or alcohol at such a young age. Censorship should definitely be in effect in places like public libraries where young children are bound to be. But, as mentioned earlier, censorship should only be to a certain degree. Keeping childrens' minds clean for as long as possible would be a very positive thing to do for both them and our society in general",4,4
3242,"Censorship is a big controversy in modern society due to the fact of so many opinions being conveyed through all the new medias in the modern world. When a person has a veiw they tend to want to share it with the world or defend it againts those who opose their opinion. Some people do not always like what is being said or take offense in the way it is presented, thus causing the government, or any authority, to remove or replace these words, photos, lyrics, or film from a select public, such as children, or the entire public. This is censorship and it has caused many debates over what is acceptable in society's media.     I believe censorship is wrong. It violates the @CAPS1 peoples' rights of free speach. When a person has an opinion, they have the right to voice it anyway they want. The authorities should not be involved in what someone writes, sings, creates, etc., in anyway. Censorship takes away from the integrity and purity of a human's thoughts.     Who is to say what can and can't be said? Do we just let the government tell us what we can say and what is illegal? Do we stop expressing ourselves in the way we desire because it is not appropriate? No. We, as the people, must be free to say what we want in our stories and songs, along with movies and other media. If a person does not like what they see then they can turn away or they have the right to speak out against it in their own way; but they do not have the right to opress. They should write back, convey their message and try to win support, not control.     Censorship is not good for any society. People want to say whatever they want and they have the right to. Censorship is not a solution to discrimation or anger, it is only a fuel. If parents do not like something and do not want their children to experience it then do not take it from them, then they should tell them how it is 'wrong' and give them their opinion and reasons so the child @MONTH1 descide what they believe in on their own. An opinion is every human being's right and it belongs to them, not the authorities.",4,4
3186,"No, I would not think it would be the right thing to do. To just take a book off the shelf just because one person or a small amount of people think that one book is offensive to them. Its not only one person to decide that. People or some people would like to vote or have a meeting about taking a book or books off the shelf cause it's offensive to them.Just because one person finds that book or books offensive doesn't mean that they should have the right to just throw the book away. Thier could be many people out thier that really like that book or those books, and they wouldn't be able to enjoy them anymore. All because one person or a few other people don't like the book.Yes their are books out thier that a lot of people don't like but that still don't give one person to throw the book out, all because they don't like that book or that seires of a book. No one should have the right to just take a book that they don't like out of a libary and throw it out because they don't like it. Their could be a smart little boy or girl that likes that book and because that one person threw it away because they don't like it, now that little boy or girl won't get to read their favorite book. Thats why I don't think books that some one thinks is offensive should be taken out of a libary. Because theirs always some one out their that likes that one book that you might want to throw away. If you think the book is that offensive to you just stay away from that area of the libary and don't think about that book",2,3
3824,"Censorship on Libraries.     Do you ever walk into a library, walk up to one of those gigantic, cluttered book shelves and pick up a book that looks promising, and worth reading? Well, what happens if you go to read the summary of this unfathomably great book, and you just feel...alienated, by the style that this book is written? Do you ever want to take that book off the shelf? Well, I do. But,  if everyone takes a book off of a shelf that they are  uncomfortable with, there would be a miniscule amount, if any books to read at all. Books based on @CAPS1, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people.     When you go to the various sections of your local library, what section do you start sprinting towards? The adult section has tons of different genres of books, but what do you do when you find one about @CAPS4? If you are a person of a certain faith, and you find a book that is making fun of your faith what do you do then? Nothing, because there is freedom of speech. You @MONTH1 be uncomfortable about that book being sold in countries all over the world, but what if someone feels that same way about your favorite book. This is a topic people have been 'debating' for years.      Suppose you glide on over to an alienated shelf. This very colorful book is just screaming for your attention?  You pick up the book and come to find, it is talking about @CAPS2. That could make anyone feel uncomfortable. I personally do not agree with making fun of poeple in this way. Poeple are made to look different for a purpose, not to humiliate them but so not all of us look the same, and we can be our own person.      What would you do if you picked up a book, where someone is being teased about their looks, and @CAPS3? Sure one joke can make everyone love you, but when one person is not very fond of you, well that speaks a thousand words. Different genres of characteristics include; being bigger or smaller, taller or shorter, having brown, blonde or red hair. Millions of people are critised and teased relentlessly becuase they look just a little bit different. Everyone has been teased once in their life. It is not very funny to the person being teased.      Books based on @CAPS4, @CAPS2 and even @CAPS3 can be a nuisence, because it segregates people. I have written you this letter to tell you that I do not support some of the books on the market or the @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11, but if everyone felt this way there would be no books. So I do not think we should take the books off of the shelves. We just need to embrace the fact that everyone is different, and that is not a joke. Where would the world be today, if we believed the same way we did years ago about these very topics? Do not take the books off the shelf, maybe one day it will signify what the world used to be",4,4
4770,"I personally think certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.; should not have to be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. First of all how do we define offensive? Is it something that discrimnates a certain group of people? Is it something that creates negative attention? Is it something we don't like? Anybody can walk in a library and find something they did not like, but that does not automatically mean it is offensive.      The national geographic magazine often has pictures of naked people and so does the @CAPS1 magazine. So which one would we have to put censorship on? The answer is we don't put one because this would start a big arguement of which is offensive and which is not.It would cause a conflict of two different sides. It is only offensive when we make it offensive. We do not have to look at something we don't like.We all have a choice and we can choose not to pick up something we might think is offensive.     The @ORGANIZATION1 @MONTH1 not get along with the @CAPS2 but if both were in a library together with both of their holy books on the shelves, they cannot say one's book is offensive to another because it does not agree with theirs. We sometimes forget we have the ammendment that allows us to the freedom of speech and press. We @MONTH1 not like what one person publishes but it doesn't make their work offensive because it might be for a certain of group that likes it, which is not offensive to them.Everything in the library has a purpose and if it does not fit our purpose then there is no way it woud be offensive to us.     The library is a place for books, music, movies, magazines, etc..We come to the library to check out books for a research in order to learn. We also go to the library to read the newest book of a series. Putting a censorship on these things would not enable us to do these. We can't finish our research project because someone thought one book was offensive or we can't listen to new album @CAPS3.Dre released because some people think the lyrics are too offensive. Putting a censorship would upset the general public more than not having a censorship because if everyone can check out what they want from the library then everyone is content",5,3
3655,"This essay is all about wether certain materials in libraries should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive to some.     I do not believe things should  be removed from shelves in libraries if they offened someone. Just because it is offensive to one person doesn't mean its offensive to all . If you are offeneded by somethings they display there are ways that you can avoid seeing them. One thing you can do to avoid it is never go by or around the shelves displaying it , ask for help so you get whatever it is that you need , or try to search what your looking for on the internet.     When i visit the library I already know what im going to get so i have never found anything offensive to me. If I did find something offensive to me I would complain and if they didnt do anything about it I would just never go back. I would just research online or go to another library where I know they will meet my needs.      The libraries I go to always have sections seperating the different age groups. The sections are split into children , teens , and adults . I' ve been to the library numerous times and I have never heard anyone with a complaint about something being offensive. If the library had something that would offense me I wouldn't know. Everytime I go I stay in one paticular section for teens and look at magazines and books .      I feel that if people are offended by what they see on the shelves they should just avoid or ignore it because everyone has their own opinion on what offends them and what doesn't",3,3
4288,"Hi, my name is @CAPS1 and I am writing this article today to talk about things that shouldn't be in the library. There are many, many things that shouldn't be exposed to children such as, sexcism,racism,rarted @CAPS3, pornography. So i am here today to tell you all about them things.      First off books that have racist comments in them should not be exposed to our young children.Why? Because that is setting a bad example for them so they might think they can say and do the things thats the book does. Another thing is sex in books. I know you have read stories that talks about sex and how to do it and all sorts of things. So to sum this up they shouldn't be allowed in public libraries.     The second thing that shouldn't be allowed in public libraries is @CAPS2-@CAPS3 movies. Things such as horror movies, porn, and many more. So young children should not be exposed to these such things because it damages there mind at a young age. It teaches them things that they shouldn't know about until they get a little bit older.      The last reason why I feel that many things shouldn't be in the libraries are for the @CAPS4 magazines. Those magazines just show everything they have all type of naked photos in them. These really do not need to be exposed to our young children because. Our little girls will think it is ok for them to take naked photos of themselves and post it in books and on the internet.      So all in all, all of these things should be banded from the libraries for many different reasons. So the @LOCATION1 should think about what I am saying. Just think if it were your children being exposed to innappropiate things",3,3
3974,"I do not think that censoship has a ightful place in our librares. I know that libraries were created to be information! hubs for the public. If censorship were put in place, then many books would be gone as they @MONTH1 be seen as offensive to a  minority of people................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................",2,2
4546,"Censorship is a matter of great contention today. Many authority figures have seemingly become obsessed with the notion that literature, video games, movies, and music are responsible for the perceived corruption of today's generation. Many believe in the idea of censorship because it will protect their children and allow them to remain innocent and morally upright. However, I believe censorship is a grand mistake on our part. Denying children access to certain literary works only keeps them ignorant, not innocent; so many books today are censored, and yet the information contained in them could have been vital to children who are seeking an understanding of the world they live in.     One of the most difficult questions about censorship is the matter of what should be censored and what should not. Books that are viewed as offensive or controversial are the usual targets, but viewing something as being offensive is just thata view. It changes from person to person because of varying cultures, religions, and moral codes. No one can agree on what will have a negative impact on children, making it impossible to establish a standard of what is best left off the shelf. The problem this creates is that many valuable books that should be permitted reading material are instead unavailable.     Censorship can protect a child from information they are better off not knowing, but it also robs them of a chance to gain vital knowledge. Children should be encouraged to read and to learn, not blocked from doing so. Yet if this is truly the case, why does the censorship debate still rage?     The argument continues because, in truth, there really are things that ought to be censored. Movies, music, and even books today can be very violent or sexual in nature, and these inappropriate subjects can have a negative impact on youths. Bloody video games and hateful song lyrics can encourage animosity towards others in children. But that cannot be the sole cause of such behavior; children will act right if they are taught how, not if they are hidden away from every instance of wrong. Censorship is greatly inferior to proper life lessons about morality, equality, peace, and respect.     Inevitably, censorship will remain a common practice. But try this: think of a book that changed your life for the better, and then imagine if you had been denied access to reading it. Do you want to let your children miss out on an experience that could very well mean the world to them?",5,5
3518,"There are many materials in libraries that are offcensive to certain people. I don't think they should be taken off the shelves but I do believe they should be put into a different section in the library.      Almost every thing in life offends someone in one way or another. It @MONTH1 be as little as 'blonde jokes' or as major as saying something about someone's sexuallity. I know little kids wouldnt understand those types of things but parents can't keep their kids hidden away forever.     If someone says something about someone else, then I do believe it's wrong. I mean think about how many 'blonde jokes' there are. A lot of blondes I know, don't take those jokes seriously. One of my good friends is a natural blonde and she is probably the smartest blonde I have ever met. Whenever she hears a blonde joke she laughs and say something funny to go with it.    Probably one of the most major things that people get offended by is politics or someones sexuallity. Politics create huge problems for people who don't think something should be one way and then if the governer turns around and says something and someone else will take it way to serious. Many people who have are different because they dont like who they are 'suppose' to like are always offended by someone in some shape or form. It's not like parents can keep us away from it forever. Little kids become teenagers, teenagers because young adults who eventually become adults. People should learn how to deal with different struggles in life.      So in conclusion, if a parent doesn't want to expose their child to things they thing is offensive then good for them but other people like to learn about the things that people find offensive and that create problems in the @LOCATION1. I believe that by leaving the books, movies and magazines on the shelves in a seperate area of the library isn't a bad idea. Think about it, if you take books away from people who want to learn about the different things and want to know why people get offended, wouldn't they feel offended too because you took that away from them",4,4
4541,"There are many works out in modern times which can be considered provacative or offensive. Some are even unfit for young eyes. There are many reasons that some will come up with for removing these books from their shelves, but I believe that no one, politician or artist alike, should have the right to put down someone else's work.      There are definitely books in libraries that wouldn't be dreamt of being checked out by the ordinary person, but these books should not be put down. I don't believe that a person's work, which is instilled with hope, money, beliefs, and elbow grease should be removed from public. No matter how offensive or wrong some @MONTH1 be, it is their work and their time, and their heart and soul which they put into a book. It is the truth that this has been done in the past to keep down rebellions and shifts in power, but nevertheless, I still disagree. For example, even today @PERSON1's @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is illegal to even have in @LOCATION1. This is for a specific reason, of course, and not a bad one at that, but I believe that this book should still be available so people can read and learn from the past.      As it has been for many centuries, the ability to publish a book means the ability to be remembered forever, and many people put their soul into the book they write. These books represent the ability to think freely, and if one is to remove books from society, then one is to remove free will and free thinking from society as well. This is accentuated especially in the dark psychological science fiction novel by @PERSON2, @CAPS3 @NUM1. This book is almost prophetic in the descriptions of future society from the perspective of a person from the @DATE1's, and almost totally accurate as to what would happen if one was to take books out of society, and was even censored itself for a long time. Of course, it conveys the extremist view of censorship, and probably won't happen in the near future, at least. It is, however, a dark omen of what is to come is censorship is freely given power.      There are many views that one can have on a single topic, book, or idea. That doesn't mean, however, that if it is viewed as wrong it should be put down. This applies to music, movies, magazines, websites, and books alike. If one removes these from society in any form, then at a raw standpoint, they are removing a piece of flavor and individuality from society. If censorship is given free reign, even if it is simply over the 'extremist' or 'radical' ideals, then people will never have the full ability to learn from their mistakes and know what to do about the future, which will simply be history that will be repeating itself. Of course, it is not my viewpoint that governments should simply let terrorists and radicals spread their ideals as they please. Once one is proven to be a threat or menace to the public, then they should most definitely be taken into custody and convicted of their wrongs.There is no doubt in my mind that the law should be upheld, but it should not overextend its boundaries.      Censorship, as a whole, is a helpful process for the benefit of the public, but all in all it removes the ability to see the raw, cold truths of life. This keeps some from ever learning how to be safe truly, and how to think and believe in their ideals. When politicians step into the boundary of art, music, literature, and even education to an extent, and try to keep it from flourishing as it naturally would, then something must be done. I'm not inciting a rebellion, but I truly do not believe that politics should rule over the artistic soul of the average man. That in itself is how society becomes self-destructive and loses its concern and connection with the world",5,5
4397,"Do i think that certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, ect., should be removed from the shelves.? No i do not think that some of these materials should be removed. Why? because nowadays kids read things such as gang violevce and things that dont involve school material but some kids find the books that they read interesting. Now, do i thing that the books should be not given to students who are very young of age? Yes, due to the fact that some books are a little above others age of reading.     Sometimes you @MONTH1 have kids who are intrested in what others dont read. Books such as gang violence and drug abuse are some of those books in categories of which some cant read. I think that in this case kids under certain age shouldnt read these books because of some of the content that is involved in it. Kids find these books, movies and magazines interesting because many things that happen in the world today happen inside those books. Im not saying that its a good thing, but im saying that the things they read and see in those books and movies are things that some of us have seen in a everyday life.     When I was younger, I went to a library in @LOCATION1, @CAPS1 and whenever a kid would choose a big that wasn't for hiim/her they would always say 'you need your parents permission to check this book or magazine ect. out'. Once I actually noticed and got the point of why they would do this I thought that it was a good idea. I figure that all libraries should be like this considering that kids shouldnt read books that arent for them. This is also a good way to get kids from reading things that not age appropriate to finding something that is.     So the main answer to this suggestion is, no, I dont think that these materials should be moved from shelves out of libraries. Why? because once they are gone then some kids might not even attend the library anymore because of the books that they find interesting are gone. So my suggestion is to not move them and let them stay on shelves just as any other book would",3,3
4214,"People of all ages have the right to read any material that they want @CAPS1 or other family members @MONTH1 tell their children not to read about a certain topic. Those children will either listen to their @CAPS1 or not. If these children do not listen, we need to do something about it. We need to have rules in libraries. Children do not need bad influences in thier lives.Adults have the right to keep children away from this information.     Leaders of a library have many different sections in their library. Children and adults both have thier own sections as well as teens. These groups of people have a right to choose what material it is that they want to read, watch, or listen to. I believe that if we make the sections have an age limit we can prevent children from finding bad information. Right now, children can read this information at any time. Adults can eliminate it.     Children in libraries should be supervized. Too many books are about drugs, sex, or pregnancy. Reading this material @MONTH1 give off bad information to a child. Children are not old enough to be learning about sex. @CAPS1 should be the first to tell thier child about sex. Young children know about drugs and know that those drugs are harmful. Children learn about drugs in movies, books, and can hear about them in music. Many books deal with pregnacy as well. Learning about pregnancy make them think how that women got pregnant with a child. Those children then start to ask other adults and children.      Children can also read or listen about gun violence. Children read about gangs and think that it is cool. They then want to play with toy guns and pretend that they are in a gang. This information is very harmful and should not be allowed to children. After some children read about it they get thier friends involved. This information can spread across the school. Violence is very harmful for children.     Librarians are not in control of the material people wish to read. If that library has offensive material it is their job not to let that material get into a young persons hands. They should be able to have strict limits on age apropriate material. If a child tries to check out a book and it seems to be over their age limit, they should not be allowed to have the book. The sections that they @MONTH1 find harmful information should be closed to young children. Children in libraries should be supervized. Books about drugs, sex, or pregnacy @MONTH1 not be allowed for children to read. Violence in books seem to spread across schools. Adults can help prevent harmful information from all children.",4,4
3115,"There are many people that think certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive and should be taken off the shelves at libraries. If you had to do a project on a subject that was offensive to certain people and there was no information on it wouldn't you be a little upset? If you found somethings that are offensive interesting you should be able to go to your local library and read a book about it, and if you like to listen to offensive kind of music then you should be able to just turn the radio on and listen to it and not have to worry about those kinds of things getting removed.       Some people are assigned projects for either their job or for school work. If the subject of your project was offensive to a certain race or person you would want there to be books or any other kind of information on the shelf at your local library so you could work on it. If all of the offensive books got removed from the shelves at libraries then nobody could be getting there work done.     Some people find some offensive subjects interesting. For example, if someone found the @PERSON1 interesting they @MONTH1 want to just do some research to learn more about it. If the books and magazines all disappeared from the shelves about this subject then those people would not be able to learn more about those kinds of subjects.     There are a lot of people that think most of the music that you hear on the radio today is offensive. If they got rid of all of that kind of music then there would probably not be a lot of music left to listen to, and a lot of people would be very mad. Also, if they got rid of all of those types of music then the writers of those songs would not be able to make any money and would be out of a job.      I think that the people who think these kinds of things are offensive should just stay away from these things and stop complaining. All of the people who do not take these things offensively will be glad that they are not removings books, magazines, music, etc. I hope you take into consideration not removing these types of things from libraries and anywhere else",4,4
4649,"Censorship in libraries today, I believe, are not a big problem. But many would disagree with that. Books and movies can be a very important resource for anyone of any age. They can gives us facts about a certain topic that we @MONTH1 not find any where else. Everyone has thier own definition of offensive. I belive that it is not only up to the library to rate the books, movies, and magazines offensive but it is also up to the participants using these resources.      For many kids, no matter what age, they only rent books from a library for two main reasons: pleasure and projects. To sensor a book from a teenager or child is just like more of an invitation to see whats inside of it. For the people who do pleasure reading they most of the time stick to only one type of genre. If someone wanted to rent a book, and it was not appropriate for them to read, then the librarian or teacher would restrict that book from them. For projects, such as for school, it would depend upon the librarian to censor the book to a child. But books are not rated such as movies are. So it really all depends upon the use of the book and the maturity of the person who is renting it. If they feel that it will not be appropriate for some, then they could give a suggestion to censor it.      Movies and books are different in many ways. Books allow you to create a mental description and picture in your mind for what you are reading. Movies, on the other hand, create a visual image right in front of your eyes. No matter how gruesome or vile of a description a book can give, it still does not compare with the visual picture of a video. Movies are rated today as to the age of a person, and they say why they are rated as such. Movies rated above the @NUM1 level are most of the time not held in libraries. They @MONTH1 still be censored if they create too vile of an image, but that is up to the one who watches it.     Music is a major part of each one of our lives, and without it the world would be a much different place. Everyone finds themselves quite fond of a certain genre of music, and most of the time sticks to it. Music, like movies, is also rated by the content of the song. If it has a word or two that should be sensored, then it is most likely already labeled 'explicit'. I think that music, just like movies, should not be able to be censored, because they are already rated accordingly.     Some books, magazines, and movies contain cold hard facts about the past years of our world and are too vile for anyone. And even though those events are in our past they are still very important to our present. Books can be a magical place for children, as well as adults, to go and create their own world. To censor a book, movie, or magazine would be taking away that chance for someone to enjoy life just a little bit more for that small moment in time.",4,4
4459,"Today, we live in a world where there are many different political, religious and personal views; and with time, these views are only going to become more varied and more wide spread. Unfortunately, it is not always easy to cater to every single persons individual takes on the world. When it comes to libraries, it is even harder to have different books for all the different opinions that will not offend people with other opinions.    Let's take @LOCATION1 for example. There are many different races and people with different religions living here. This is a place that has already been through a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and has fought against racism and slavery. Although these are things that our country has overcome, there are still going to be arguments and disagreements over these problems. When there are different opinions, there are always going to be different books out there about the same topic from multiple points of view. As the readers of these books we need to know what point of view this is coming from and not choose a book that goes against our personal beliefs. This is where the offensiveness comes from. We live with many different people and we need to understand that not everyone is going to have the same views on life that we do.      When I was in eighth grade, I was @CAPS6 @ORGANIZATION1 with some friends. One of them was pulling her eyes back (like someone would do if they were imitating an @CAPS3 person) because they were itchy. A very pregnant @CAPS3 @CAPS5 woman walked in and took offense to my friends eye movements. She yelled @CAPS6 us and said, 'I would have thought your parents raised you better than that.' @CAPS6 first, we did not understand what this woman was talking about until we realized that our friend had been pulling her eyes back. This showed us that different people can take offense to different things because of their heritage.     There is nothing we can do about the expanding cultures in our country. We cannot change the views of certain people in order to match those of our own beliefs nor can we change the fact that all the different people are going to voice their opinions and view them as 'right'. However, we can change the way that we view these people. We need to understand that there is no 'right' when you are dealing with multiple opinions. @CAPS6 this point we need to embrace everyone else for who they are and what they believe because there is nothing we can do to change those beliefs.     So next time you pick up a book @CAPS6 the library, read the summary and check to see that the author agrees with you before you take the book home or there are going to be disagreements in your views. If you get a book and you don't agree with it or if you are offended by it, there is no one to be mad @CAPS6 but yourself for not checking to see the author's stance on the topic before you started reading it",5,4
4325,"My name is @CAPS1 and my views on censorship in libraries are that if any material that are found offensive should be take off the shelves. I have never came across a material that was offensive to me, but maybe someone else has and it really offended them. I'm not the type of person who would start an argument but i am a type of person who will speak whats on my mind and tell you what i believe in.      People are concerned about if libraries take off certain kinds of books that their will not be books left on the shelves for anyone else. I have to say there are other places you can buy books at beside the libraries such as stores as in @ORGANIZATION1, @ORGANIZATION2, and etc. Like i said i have never came across a book that i think should be pulled off the shelf, but of course i don't read a whole lot either but the books i have read i have never came a crossed any that were terrible.     Books that have like how people can kill themselves, or how people get pregnant, and so on, them can be pulled off the shelves, but if you have a child in the library they shouldnt even be in the adult book section anyways, they should be in the kids book section. I have never heard of a kid book that is terrible and that should be pulled off the shelf. Most authors are smarter then that, or at least i would hope so.      Music is a whole story its self. In my opinon if you don't want your kids to listen to adult music then don't let them. I know a lot of music that is bad and that i would never let my children listen to it but i know well enough if i don't want them to listen to it them i'm not going to play it while their around. I grew up around rap music so thats all i listen to, but when i have kids i know what they will be able to listen to and what they wont be able to listen to.      Movies is the one that i have a problem with the most because in libraries, and other places such as, @ORGANIZATION1, and book stores they just put out movies for EVERYONE to see and it doesn't matter what's on the cover or what it's called. Now movies with bad covers and bad titles could be pulled off the shelves such as all the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' movies. The name of the movies aren't bad but the movie its self is not for a child to see so why even have it out on shelves for kids to see and want to watch it?      Magazines and etc i don't have a big problem with because libraries don't have bad ones, but book stores do such as 'playboy and play girl' but they are usually put back in the very back behind all other magazines so children can't see them only adults can. The only way a child would see them is only if you point them out.      I think i've said all i can say about my opinions and my experiences about books, music, movies, and magazines in libraries that should or shouldn't be pulled off the shelves. I havn't had a lot of experience but maybe that's because i don't have kids yet, i guess i will find out when i do have kids. I happy to explain my experiences and opinions to people who really care and want to know",3,4
4524,"Libraries have all kinds of books. Books for everyone. I think libraries shouldn't have to take books out because some people dont like it, or find it offensive, when others might like the author.      If there is a book in the library that you find displeasin simpley don't cheak it out just put it back on the shelf and go on with your day. Like author Katherine Paterson said if we start taking book off the shelvies then there willn't be any books left to read. Yes, there are books out there that are not ment for little kids and some adults, but that's why you dont let them cheak them out till you think they are old enough. Just because you dont like the book doesn't mean noone else likes it. Everyone has there own tast in reading, as everything else.     Libraries have sections for all ages. With books for there age. Like the childern's section is for little kid, and the adult section is for adults. Little kids shouldn't be cheaking out books from the adult section. Parents should take responsibility over there kids and watch what they'r doing. Then we wouldn't have to worrie about what they are reading, watching, or listening to.     The libraries are doing just fine the way they are, and have been for years, and will for years to come. So no libraries shuold have to take sertain books off the shelves just because someone doesn't like it, or want there kid reading it. Just ignore that the book is even there and find another one that fits you'r liking. People learn alot from books, so if we get rid of most of them what will we lear from then? Books are a great part of history. Why get rid of you'r history? It's just wrong. Books shouold stay right where they are and belong.",3,4
4082,"Dear sir or mam,      Have you or someone in your family ever read a book, magazine, or watched a movie that was taken to be offensive? Do you or that person think that it would make a difference if that one book, book or movie was removed from the shelves? Would removing every  book, cd, movie or magazine  from shelves that were to have a great or small amount of racism, violence, bad language and other inappropriate things be helping the community? Do you believe that its everyone's decision whether or not those things should be removed from the shelves?     I believe that alot of people in our community have read a book in their lifetime that they considered to be the slightest bit offensive to them. I bet people all over the world have read offensive books. But the only types of people that those books, movies or magazines would affect would be teenagers and kids. But at the time they wouldn't see it as offensive, they would think that it was cool and interesting and they would want to read or watch it over and over again until they were to get bored of it then they would gone back the library and get another one.           I think in a way it would and would not make a difference whether or not they were removed from the shelves. Because if only that one book, movie or magazine was removed from the shelves then the person that got it removed would move on from that book,magazine or movie and find plenty more of them that would be more or equally offensive. If every people were to remove every book that they were to find offensive then other people who would enjoy them that certain thing wouldn't beable to obtain it.If everyonewere to find all kinds different books, movies or magazines offensive and got them removed from the shelves then their wouldn't be very much left for the community.     In conclusion I believe that every individual has their opinion and own way of thinking when it comes to what is and is not offensive. I think it is not just up to them on what should be on the shelves in a library, but the communities choice. If someone wants a good book,magazine, or movie they should ask suggestions from a friend or family member on what they should get. If they can't get any suggestions on what they should get they should just what they think is interesting ignore the offensive parts",4,3
3650,"There I was, shuffling my way through the library, finding the perfect books to check out.  It was then that I had stumbled upon a book that looked incredibly interesting.  The cover page featured a depressed girl with the look of hope plastered on her face and the back included the summary of a book I wanted to get my hands on.  The book, titled @CAPS1, was about a girl who went through some troubled times but found her way out of it.  Stories, novels, magazines, or books on tape of any type find their way onto our library shelves, it is then our job to discover them.  Whether literature includes stories of love and breakbreak, sorrow and depression, or the success of a sports team, it should all be allowed on our library shelves.      Opinion, everyone has one that conflicts with someone elses.  Our world revolves around these different viewpoints and ideas, should our literature and music not reflect these opposing sides?  Literature is an escape for many people, it is their way of experiencing the world and to live through the main character of whatever they are reading.  If we remove books that @MONTH1 be offensive to one, we are taking away that opportunity for others. In my opinion, the removal of the potentially offensive material in our libraries, is sheltering our world.       Regardless of how hard we try, children and teenagers will one day be exposed to the offensive material we are attempting to remove from their lives.  We should not attempt to hide what our actual world is like, rather allow them to experience it in a safe way, like reading or listening to music.  If someone views material as offensive, it should be the parent's responsibility to regulate whether their child reads or listen to it or not.  The removal of the potentially offensive material would not be any help.     In conclusion, offensive material should not be removed from our libraries, rather regulated through our parents or elders.  The idea of regulating what is on our shelves is not the most effective.  If any material has the potential of being offensive, it is not the library's role to regulate whether or not it is displayed to the public",4,5
3636,"I believe that if there is a book in a library that a child is not allowed to read that the book should be some where the kid shouldnt be able to get it. I think those types of books should be stored in the part of the library were a child shouldn't have access to. Also the library should have a section to where only the certain age can read that book. In some libraires there are a bunch of books that are not made for a child to read and they have them to where a child can get access to them and that shouldnt be allowed. So i believe that they shouldn't allow children to get access to those types of books.     The same thing applies in a store. In some stores they have a magazine section where there are bad stuff that a kid is not allowed to see. I know in the grocery store that i go to there are inaproperiate images and words that a child should see or read. So there should be an area inside that store that a certain age can access them because one day i was in the store and i saw a little kid reading a magazine and saying the bad words that were in it and looking at the bad pictures it also had in it. So that is the reason they should put the magazines in a place were children shouldn't get access to them.     In the same store there is a music section and there are children in it all the time. The music is not all that bad its just that the kids can take these off the shelves and take it home and listen to it. This is the part that is the parents fault by buying the @CAPS1 for the child to listen to. So if the parent buys the child that @CAPS1 that is bad it is the parents fault. But i think that the @CAPS1's for little children should be in one part of the store and the @CAPS1's for the older people should be where the can get access to it.     This same thing applies with movies. There are movies in stores that are rated from @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, @CAPS6, and even for @CAPS7 audiences only. In a bunch of the movies form @LOCATION1@NUM1 abd up have a bunch of stuff in them that a child should not see. Like in the @CAPS7 audiences only movies they show nudity and a lot more stuff that no one under @NUM3 shouldnt see but they have some of those just sitting on the shelves at stores. So children shouldn't be able to have access to those types of movies.     The reason i explained all of this is so children dont get ahold of them. Like in the music if the kids start listening to some bad music they will start saying those bad words and get in trouble at school and anywere else. Even if the chid reads a book that has bad stuff in it they will start saying those words or even do the stuff that happens in the book. In the movies that a child is not suppost to see like a gory action movie or a movie that shows nudity or even a movie that cuses that child will see that movie and will show there friends or get ideas form the movie. And these are the reasons why a child shouldn't be allowed to get access to this kind of stuff.",4,4
3998,"Some materials could be seen as offensive to some people. It could have language, racial slurs, or anything else one might find offensive. In my personal opinion I believe anyone should have the right to read or watch whatever they choose.     These books or movies are put out there for entertainment or learning purposes. Some things did happen, such as the @LOCATION1, that many people would like to forget but no matter which way you take it, it happened and we can't change it. This can teach the next generation that it was a bad idea and should not have happened in the first place, so they will not do it.     Language is a big part of today's world and many do not appreciate a bad word. They put these in movies to emphasize somthing big because everyone will remember that word. I know that it is not necessary all of the time and could be taken out, but for some movies a certain word could make or break the scene. Some movies have a lot of cursing in them but that does not make it a bad movie. A few of the best movies I have ever seen have too many bad words to count but the stroy line is phenominal. What you gain from watching those movies is not the cursing, it's the success of the protagonist that makes it enjoyable and worth your time.     As for books in libraries, we should make a seperate section for these offensive materials so that a young, innocent child does not wonder across them. Put up signs warning people of the material contained in that section and put a speical sticker on the book to warn parents as well.     In conclusion, offensive materials are not always bad and should not be removed from shelves, just mabye to a different location. Let the people read what they want to read.",4,4
3350,I don't think that they should be removed from the shelfs. Everyone has a right to read it at some point in time. To were no little kids can rent the book. If they are complaining about how it's volgar or sexual. Then you shouldn't take it away. Try something else such as an adult section. One person @MONTH1 love a book that has some violence in it and on the other hand you @MONTH1 have a person who is real religous and can't stand to see it.      There are very many view points of this topic. The parents who don't want their kids to be exposed to this type of life style. Some people don't really think about it being as bad as the next person. If it's a book you dislike on a book shelf and you don't like it put out in plain sight. Should you really be the one to make the decision on who takes it down?     Some people don't know what their kids like to read. If they have the final thought on what gets taken down it @MONTH1 affect the kids reading habbits. What if your kid wants to read a horror book and you choose not to let those kinds of books on the shelf any more. Then they don't want to read the books that are left up on the shelf. I'd rather read a book that interests me than a book that I dislike.     My point of view on this topic is simple. I don't think the parents should be in controle of what we read as long as it's appropriate. I think the decision should be left for the government to say which book should and shouldn't be taken away.,3,4
3335,"I think books, movies, music, and magazines that are offensive should not be pulled from the shelfs. If you find something offensive then dont pick it up, its that simple. You @MONTH1 find something offensive but it might not be to someone else. It is all according to you own personal opinion.     Sure, there are somethings that are very offensive to certain people, and those people will try to put a stop to it. But I think that is wrong. Because it @MONTH1 be offensive to you but what if there is somone studying that topic but cant find the information on it because you thought it was offensive and got it pulled off of the shelf. Then it disrupts that persons study.      I am not promoting violent books and movies or other offensive material, all im saying if you find something offensive then turn the other cheek. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but other people @MONTH1 not think the same way.     There are many books and movies out there that are offensive to many people. And if we were to take all of those movies and books off of the shelf then there would be very few subjects and title to read and watch.     In my conclusion, I support the fact that offensive material should stay on the shelfs. It could be helpful to many people and at the same time it can be offensive to alot of people. But if you are one of those people that find something offensive then dont pay any attention to it and find another subject or topic. For someone to take another persons right to read a book or watch a movie is wrong everyone has their own opinions and rights",4,3
4636,"People should have a right to listen, read, and watch whatever they want. It is people's own choice to what they read, watch, or listen to. They will not be able to change that person by taking out offensive movies or books. They will only go somewhere else and do it.      People have a right to read, listen to, and watch what they feel is good for them. If others find that offensive then that is their problem. People make their own decisions and that is their right. I feel that if you tell someone that they can not do a certain thing that will only make them want to do it more.      Taking offensive books, music, movies, and magazines will not solve a problem that our society has with being offensive to others, it will only mask it. Taking them out will not all of a sudden make people stop being offensive to others, they just won't do it in libraries.            Every book, music or movie will be offensive to some other person and if we take all the offensive stuff out there will be nothing left to read. It is just something that we will have to deal with. So I do not agree with censorship in libraries.      It will only take away our right to read and view what we want but also it will take away all the offensive movies and books we have; which is almost every book. Everyone feels that one book or another if offensive to them and if we take away those books we will have nothing left in our libraries",3,3
4758,"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, I don't think so, these items should stay on the shelves for the appropriate ages. If you are over the age of eighteen you should be able to pick and chose to what ever topic they want. If you are under the age of eighteen there should be an age requirement and also require parent consent.      For those under eighteen when they get a library membership they should have to verify thier date of birth, and what thier parent srequest their child to be able to read, play, or watch. Librarys and book stores should put a rating on the magazines or books, just like movies. This will promote less parents of anger for thier children listening to music or reading inappropriate books, magazines, or video games. Now if books stores sell these books to underage children without parent consent, there can be charges pressed. It would be pretty much the same thing as selling liquor, or cigarettes to a minor.     From my observations with my little brother, my mother chose to let him play inappropriate video games. For instance these games consisted of violence, sex, drugs, and foul language. In result of this I notice that my brother does not obey, or treat my mother with the respect as he should. He also misbehaves in school constantly. That is just one example of the many I know of.     Even if the parent gives permission for thier child to watch offensive movies, play inappropriate video games, or read certain books that are not suitable for his/her age, they should still have to be a certain age. Some parents make poor decisions on thier parenting, and it will reflect them later in life.     So my overall opinion would be no. Keep the books on the shelf for the people that are mature enough to watch, read, or play. If they limit the selling of these items to minors, these children @DATE1 will not have as many crimes all together. There would be less violence, and drug offenses or abuse. Keep this all in mind.                                                                 @ORGANIZATION1",4,4
3087,"AS WE ALL KNOW, ALL KINDS OF INFORMATION CAN BE FOUND IN A LOCAL, BOOK STORAGE FACILITY, COMMONLY REFERED TO AS A LIBRARY.

MANY LIBRARIES @MONTH1 POSSESS ON THEIR SHELVES BOOKS AND MAGAZINES AND EVEN MUSIC CONTAINING EXPLICIT MATERIAL, AND HOW COULD YOU AVOID IT? IN A MODERN WORLD, THERE'S GOING TO BE LANGUAGE AND PERSONAL ATTRIBUTES THAT WOULD BE FOUND OFFENSIVE TO OLD PEOPLE AND VIEWERS OF PUBLIC BROADCASTING. YES, I AGREE SME MATERIAL CAN AND SHOULD BE IN SEPARATE AREAS THAT MAINSTREAM MATERIAL, BUT ON A WHOLE, WHO CARES?I MEAN, MOST ORDINARY PEOPLE DON'T. I KNOW I DON'T. CENSORSHIP IS STUPID, BECAUSE MOST OF THE STUFF IN LIBRARIES, IF YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF IT YET, YOU WILL SOON, NO MATTER WHAT CENSORSHIP STEPS ARE TAKEN BY LIBRARY OFFICIALS",2,2
4306,"I think that they libraries should not remove any of the books they have now. If parents or people dont want to read those type of books they dont have to. But they should'nt be removed. I agree that some books are inappropriate and have bad language in them but thats part of the book and how the story was made. When a book is made they way it is and is already published there should'nt be any changes made to it.            If a story contains a certain scene that a person believes should'nt be in the book, that person needs to put that book back and choose another book they think is appropriate. Some people like to read stories with details so they can picture it in there mind. I know I do. In libraries they have books with inappropriate language and scenes discribed but to a certain age. I think you have to be thirteen or older to read them, and thats a good thing because by that age you know things better and your parents should'nt be too worried. So in my opinon I dont think they should be removed from libraries. On the other hand movies that have scenerios that are disturbing should be removed.           Movies are a whole different thing then books. They show the material that is being described and I dont think teens should be watching that. They can be very unappropriate and disturbing to some people like me. I would'nt want to watch that in front of my mom or dad and especially a younger sibbling. Then again its just my opinion. If parents are okay with there child or children watching that then it should'nt be a problem.           Music is'nt that bad. There are a lot of parents who dont want there child or children listening to a sertain type of music because of their religion and what they believe in. I totally agree. My parents at the beggining would'nt let me listen to music where all they would do is sing about sex and curse over and over. As I got older they did'nt care much because I would'nt listen to it as much. Im a teen and I also believe that some of the music now in days in not very appropriate for anyone at any age. Some of what they sing does'nt even make much sense. In libraries I think they should only have music that realates in some how to the books.     Magazines are not really a problem. Most of the magazines talk about beauty and fashion tips. They have horoscopes and give advise. A lot of the magazines keep people updated on celeberties and there life style. It has some what gossip. There mostly for older teens and grown ups. For younger teens and kids there's more appropriate magazines where they talk about younger celeberties.      This is my point of view on things. I know that a lot of people dont entirely agree with me but this is what I think. I also know that there @MONTH1 be a lot of people who agree with me and they'll most likely give the same reasons as I did to support their choice",3,4
4485,"Have you ever picked up a book, video, or music from the self and wondered why is this here, it's not a well thing for our younger kids to read, watch or listen to. I think that we should pluck out these types of books on our shelf at our libaray to better our community for our kids and their kids. We have all the right to voice our opion on things that we think should and shouldn't be in our libaray. Books that promote sexual activity, killing people, using or taking drugs, and other harmful things, which isn't the best for our kids to read, listen to, or watch should be removed from our libaray shelf.     Have you ever noticed how are crime rate and drug rate has went up in the past few years? These types promotes are in some of our books, videos, and other media. If we remove the videos, books, and other media that promote this kindof behavior we would have less of this type of crimes going on. I don't believe we would have all this crimes going on if we would remove this type of media because we all have a person we want to be like in a song or tv show or even in a book so we follow what they do, if they promote crime you try to act like them. We as humans follow the actions of others weither we think about it or not.     Music also plays a big roll in this to, music containing bad laguage or promoting someone to take drugs or kill people, has been proven to play with our minds. Would you as a parent want to see your kid raised up in a community that promotes sex, drugs, kill people, and other things that we shouldn't do? There's music we all like out there, we listen to what we like so that being, if we like rap for explain, if it promotes killing we are more likely to follow that action in the song because your mind thinks it's self out of it being a crime to kill cause you like rap music so it must be okay.     We @CAPS1's in our community believe that we should abstian our selfs from this kindof behavior and we don't see to many drugs, killings, or sexual activity. The bilbe teaches us to stay away from things that promote drugs, killing, or sexual activiy, thus we don't see much of these behavoirs in a @CAPS2 home or community. @CAPS4 are more better off then lot's of us weither we want to aceppt that or not. They live a life after @CAPS3, which don't promote all these behavoirs. and I know that @CAPS4 would be more willing to take out these type of media in our libaray. You can sit for one whole day and watch the actions of @CAPS4 and how they act they don't act like normal people as far as into drugs and stuff like that, only because they abstain their selfs from media that promotes sex, killing, and drugs.     Now, if you want to help us make our community a better place for your kids and their kids, let's remove the harmful media in our libaray that promotes sex, drugs, and killing. I don't think you would want to see your kid doing drugs or killing people and messing up their lifes because you didn't help in removing this media. Please help us better our community for our kids and their kids and the genrations to come after us.",3,4
3952,"First of all i believe if its on the shelf you should be able to get it, no matter what your age is. Yeah theirs thing's that shouldn't be on the shelf, but how are kids and people supposed to know to get that or not. If kids arnt alowed to get certant material on the shelfs, Then it shouldn't be their, @CAPS1 my oppinion.     Parents @MONTH1 think differnt, parents might think only certant things should b alowed at a libray. @CAPS1 not their choice though. Anything is alowed to be at a libray. If you dont want your kid reading or getting certant thing's, then when your kid goes to the libray go with them. Help them pick out a book.     In conclusion i believe you should be able to check anything that is on the shelf. Kid or if your an adult. If your not alowed to get, then why is it their? I dont know i couldnt anwser that question, other than why is it their? @CAPS1 my oppinion though",2,3
3391,"'@CAPS1'@CAPS2 say that word!' That is exactly what I said to my brother after he had read the front cover of a magazine in the library one afternoon. Personally, I am an advocate of not saying curse words. Yet, my brothers are influenced by things, such as the media, to say them. Should we allow the media to sprinkle words like this on to magizine's and books? Or should the items containing these things be removed from the library's shelfing units?     Magazine's are one of many ways that we get the latest gossip on the most interesting scandals. They also appeal to a lot of people across the world. Most of those people are @DATE1 of age. Library's will most often place the magazine's on the shelf so that they can rake in some adult costumers. Most of  the content of the magazine's are pictures of half dressed women or men and explict lanuage on the covers these days. Should that be the new normal? I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think so.     I enjoy reading. I personally think that reading is better @DATE1 sitting on the couch and watching mind numbing @CAPS2.V. But, the material of some books have gotten to be where every other word is a curse word. Or they contain degrading scenes that no one should have to read. It used to be that books were read to learn something new, or to open your mind to a new culture or piece of information. In these times, though, it seems ardous to come across a good book that is like the classics. As though day by day, we are replacing the magestic words of authors for common words that anyone can use. Replacing such books like these on the shelves for anyone to read isn'@CAPS2 right. It shouldn'@CAPS2 even be allowed.     With electronic devices such as the @NUM1 player and so on, most of the music comes from online sites where you purchase the song directly. Most parents @CAPS1'@CAPS2 know half the songs that the children buy, expecially when they @CAPS1'@CAPS2 buy it at home. With internet in many libraries kids can plug in their device and buy songs with offensive lanuage or graphic material without anyone knowing. Why @CAPS1'@CAPS2 the librarians put restrictions on the sites? The answer is that they can'@CAPS2. And, even if they did children would find a way to get around the restrictions. So, personally I think that they should remove the avaliablity of being able to download and purchase music at the library.Or take out the aweful lanuage all together in songs. Because the lanuage that they use is not needed.     Although times are constantly changing and things are different then they used to be, with a little help we can restore it to where it used to be. Kids using such foul lanuage is an issue that needs to be taken seriously. From my own experiences I know that it is a growing problem. But, maybe if we put censorship in libraries then some or most of the problems can disappear. From magazine articles, books, and even songs explict lanuage and graphic scenes are almost everywhere. So, speak up and talk to someone about the idea. It might just start a revolution",4,4
3792,"I believe that if something is found offense to someone then it dosent mean its offense to someone else. In libraries there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc, some of these different type of things @MONTH1 come across as offesnse to some but others @MONTH1 enjoy it. Therefore it shouldnt be taken away from those who enjoy reading or listening to these things.          Some things such as adult novels and explict music are things people consider to be offensive. But what they dont understand is that some people actually enjoy listening or reading this material so taking it away from them is not right. Everyone should be able to have different likes in these areas. Everyone is not the same.     If you attend a library you should be able to find something that fits your style or sparks your intrest. If the things that people like are being taken away then its not giving them a wide variety of things they enjoy doing. Its more likely closing them out on things they like because other people dont like it or find it offensive.     Lastly, those that think that these things are offensive are entitled to there opinion. But so are those that believe that these things are good. There should remain a variety of different books, music, and other things that appeal to all types of personalities.     Everyone has a right to say weither they dont like something. But what you dont like someone else does. So to take away things that other people enjoy is unjust.",3,3

4612,"In the book '@CAPS1 @NUM1', books are outlawed. In such a society, owning a book would result in recieving a punishment. Without books, @CAPS2 people turned to electronics for entertainment. The society as a whole had lost @CAPS2 human emotions and became submissive to the government. @CAPS4 led to injustices that the government inflicted upon its people because it didn't have any opposition. Katherine Paterson suggests that if books begin to be thrown out, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 people argue that certain media should be removed from libraries because they find it offensive. However, if every piece of media that was requested to be removed was taken out, @CAPS2 important works would be thrown away.     A recent debate has arisen over @PERSON1's 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS4 book is set in the @LOCATION3 during the time of slavery. @ORGANIZATION1 @PERSON4 befriends a black man, @PERSON6, and shares @CAPS2 experiences with him along the @LOCATION1. @PERSON1 decided to write his book using the true diction of the people who lived in the @LOCATION3 during @CAPS4 time period. He was the first author to do @CAPS4. Because he wrote it in @CAPS4 way, the book contains the n-word multiple times. @CAPS4 word is not acceptable today, and therefore @CAPS2 people take offense to his work. However, @CAPS4 book plays a major role in the @CAPS5 cannon. @PERSON1's work was written in a new and breakthrough method. If someone were to remove @CAPS4 work off of the shelves of libraries, he would remove one of the most important pieces of @CAPS5 literature.     '@ORGANIZATION2' by @PERSON3 is a book that explores the life of a convict in prison. During his time at @LOCATION2, he discovers that he is a homosexual. He falls in love with a man named @PERSON5 and begins to have sexual relationships with @CAPS2 of the men in his cell. These relationships are described in detail. If one were to read the surface of the book, he would find a crude description of a convict's experience in prison. However, @CAPS4 is not the case. @PERSON3 struggled with the concept of being bisexual throughout his life. He also had problems with his parents and brother. In '@PERSON2', he wrote about his own feelings through his characters. @CAPS4 story is not about sex, but about feelings of entrapment and the relationships one has with other people. If @CAPS4 book were to be removed from libraries, @CAPS2 people would miss a story that they might connect with.     Katherine Paterson brings up an interesting question. What would happen if everyone could remove the books they dislike? The answer would be a society that is unable to share ideas, concerns, and experiences. Media helps to enlighten, persuade, and educate people about important issues. While some works @MONTH1 have offensive language, they also have a deeper meaning.",5,4
3142,"Comics, romance, adventure books, and mystery books are just the few different types of books out there as well as the magazines and music we listen to. With a little bit of everything, and whatever your passion is, we have that right in our local libraries to go look at or hear whatever pleases us but, some of the people that go there are not adults. Some of them are young children who are either checking out a book themselves or are simply with there parent/guardian. I believe that even though there are some books magazines, and music not attended for children, they still shouldn't be removed just because they are found offensive.     Everyone once in their life had to atleast experience something unpleasant. But knowing our world today, we simply can not hide from those things but yet face them, we adults are old enough to just walk away from something we find offensive unlike what our children or other children can do. Sometimes, even children have to go through it as well. It's part of growing up and also a learning experience for all of us.      If you already know what parts of the library have stuff children shouldn't see, don't bring your child to that area. And if it's possible, bring them to an area where they @MONTH1 sit and read there favorite books as well with you by there side where you can watch there every move. And at the same time, you don't have to take a chance at explaining something that you are not quite ready or sure that your child is ready to hear or see.      Since it's impossible to hide things from your children that you are not wanting them to see and hear at the same time, that's a part of life. Even if they are still really young and ask what a certain thing is, we can simply turn there heads and make them get distracted by something else and pretend that we didn't hear what they said. But as your children get older, they should know right from wrong and know what things they @MONTH1 read and things they can't.     Some of us are oblivious to the world around us and @MONTH1 not know that certain things can cause more harm than good, even like taking your children to the library. If you don't like a certain thing there or know that there is going to be something you simply do not want your child to see or hear, then don't bother taking them with you on your next visit and go another time when your child is with a babysitter or take a chance into bringing them with you an expect the unexpected when it comes to offensive items at the library",4,4
4645,"People find things offensive everyday. It is just a matter of life. Some people have a right to feel offended for some reasons, but they really can't control it from happening. It is just something that has occured for thousands of years. And people have slowly began to deal with it.     So therefore, i believe that books and other materials that are found offensive should not have to be taken down because it offends someone, because taking it down could offend someone else. What i'm really trying to get across is that no matter what, not everyone will be happy. Life is filled with mixed society and emotions, so not everyone will agree on the same thing. Also it should be up to the library whether or not they want to remove some of their material. Because they did pay for it and have a right to let people in society watch, read, or listen to it. Thus being said, i believe that they should try to keep certain offensive material to a minimum. Such as racism, it seems as though rasicm impacts alot of the country still today. And will forever be an on growing matter in problems around the @CAPS1.          In conclusion, i believe that the library has a right to own books or movies that are somewhat offensive. Because like i said everyone deals with it at one point, and not everyone can be happy. And some of the material is most likely educational and teaches us about the history of the @LOCATION1,@CAPS1, ect, rather than being racist or offensive as everyone jumps to conclusions about. And everyone needs to get past the offensive side and get to a level where everyone sees eye to eye. For we are all the same, but yet, still broken up among looks and culture",4,4
4054,"The @CAPS1,     I read an intresting @CAPS2 the other day by Katherine Paterson an author. The @CAPS2 said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- the work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'      I believe that people should not have the right to take matieral such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. of the shelf of a library, or anywhere else those items are displayed. So I agree %@NUM1 with Paterson because people have their own opions. Some stuff @MONTH1 be more offensive than others to different people. I have observed people, and were all different so why should our thoughts be to? The answer is yes they should be different. But it is pretty simple if you find a book, song, movie, or magazine that you find offensive or distasteful then put it back another person might find it intresting.      I want to know the thoughts of my fellow citizens about what Paterson has said. I am asking for your help to do so. I would like you to put the @CAPS2 in The @CAPS1 and hear what people have to say about it. Thank You for accepting my @CAPS4.                                                                      @PERSON2",3,2
4155,"I think that censorship in libraries is and is not a good idea because some people wouldnt get to read what they want to. I read world war @CAPS1 books, and a wide selectionof others and if they take those away just for being offensive id have nothing to read. If i find a book i think is offinsive I just put it back and dont get it.     I think they should age books like this book is for ages @NUM1, and especialy movies and magizines because kids dont need to read or see certain things, because books and movies sometimes refer to drugs or alcohole and murder. I dont think music is a big deal because music isnt very influincial but music videos are soometimes bad. Movies sometimes go to far though and i wouldnt want my kids watching them, so i wouldnt mind if they take thos off the shelves if they are offinsive.I dont think books should be taken off the shelf because parents should know what there kids are reading anyway. I would at least check the book or magazine before geting it for my kids and so should other parents.theres always going to be offinsive books and movies so its the parents job to make sure there kids dont get thos kinds of books or magazines.",3,3
3687,"Books, movies, magazines, music, and most of all, life. We all know whats wrong, and what's right.     Every school is different. Some schools have limits on their books, such as if you're two years old, and reading something like @PERSON1, then that's gonna be inappropriate. If you're sixteen and reading a @PERSON2 book, then that's too inappropriate for their age limit. Every age is different, so your not going to find some forty-three year old hobo on the streets reading, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS1' by @PERSON2. Most likely, he'll be reading a mystery book, or something appropriate for his age not for someone that's five. Books shouldn't be banned because some elementary mother doesn't want her seven year old reading '@CAPS4'. Just because some mothers want it banned, doesn't mean it should be. Be smarter and watch what your kids are reading, it shouldn't have to be banned from other children just because you don't want your kid reading it.     Don't we all agree that music is life? Not everyone has to listen to rap, nor do they have to listen to opera. Don't you see that we have musical artist in the world that depend on music? So why should rap be banned just because it talks about killing, drugs, and drinking. I say who cares? Don't listen to it if you don't like it, it doesn't mean you have to ruin it for everyone else. I love all kinds of music, so nothing should be banned. In my opinion I hate christian songs, I think they're too slow, and constantly talking about @CAPS5, but that doesn't mean I should ruin it for everyone else, just because I hate it. Everyone is different, no one is the same. Music helps me gets through life, and I know it helps you get through yours too, it shouldn't be banned.     Movies, movies, movies! Video games, video games, video games! We all love cuddling and watching movies together, but not all movies are right for us. Movies have ratings like video games do. Ratings show what's appropriate for a twelve year old verses a twenty-five year old. Adults would most likely be playing a rated @CAPS6 game, and watching rated @CAPS7 movies. Little kids about the age of six would be playing rated @CAPS8 games, and watching rated @CAPS9 movies. As you can see everyone is different especially when it comes to these things. Rated @CAPS7 movies usually have gore, sexual themes, strong language, and things little kids should never watch. It doesn't mean it should be banned, maybe blocked in your home, but not banned.     In my opinion, I think all movies, books, music, video games, etc., shouldn't be banned. It just should all be carefully watched to see who's hands it lands into, and who's eyes are viewing it. We should be responsible enough to pick out the material for ourselves. No one should tell me what not to read or watch: unless I am a youth. Then material should be suppervised by my parents.",4,3
4682,"Censorship in libraries is a great issue in the world today. Many authors now use offensive methods and terms to persuade their audiences. However, many do not. All authors have the right to say what they wish but there is a limit to where the books should be placed and who should view them.     If libraries accept offensive types of magazines, books, music, movies, etc., they should most certainly be placed out of the reach of children. Like many libraries in the city, there is a section for children and a sperate section for adults. Any materials that are found offensive should be placed in a special section of the adult area and customers should be warned in some way. Since everyone has their own view of what is right and what is wrong, a special team should be placed in charge of keeping the offensive materials seperate. Those who borrow anything at the library @MONTH1 have the right to bring that special book or movie to the attention of those in charge. By sticking to this method, offensive materials can stay out of the hands of those who do not wish to see them.     Items containing vulgar language is unjust to most. There are still the majority, however, who engage in the oppertunity to view these materials. Everyone does have the right to do what they wish but, from personal experience and growing up in a home where I was taught right from wrong, people should be treated with dignity as well as respect. No matter our color, size, looks, or personalities, we are all created equally as our constitution says. Therefore, we should only view what would be considered just to all. After all, everyone wishes to be treated kindly, right",3,3
3821,"Everybody is in tittle of making their own desicion. If that includes not letting their own children look at certain books then that's okay, but that doesn't mean they have to make that desicion for everyone. Everyone has their own opinion of certain books that might be less modest than others that just how it is, but to take the book out of the libraries is not taking in consideration of others.     If there are some books that are offense to a certain type of ethnicty or religion ect. then just ignore it and go on. There is no reason to take those kinds of books out, for what we all know that certain book might be used for research and that person that needs. Taking out certain books of the library are depriving the youth from contemporary literature that is going to be very imporant for the future. The @CAPS1 is a good example, in the time it got published many people wanted to get rid of the book because it was not traditional, that book is now being used in our class room and is teaching us many literary techniques. There are countless books just like The @CAPS1 that are being taked out of libraries now and that could be deeply appreciated by the future writers.     Katherine Paterson has the prospective of many authors, taking out books that are offensive to people is going to cause us to have no books. For hard working writers it is unfair to work so hard and have the book band from the libraries because a certain group of parents didn't find it approving. If they don't approve of the book then tell the child not to get it. A library is a place to enjoy the countless amount of literature of many different styles and should not be restricted. The library is a place of discovery not a place of restriction.",3,3
4254,"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 I have found that there has been a strong censorship in the libraries and I would like to express my strong disagreement for these actions. I have found that things have been removed from your shelves due to its content. Some of the content is vulgar and explicit and some is very offensive, but that still does not give you the right to remove these things. Books, movies, music, and magazines are very big parts of peoples lives and removing these things can be a big part of someones development.      First off you should not be taking books off of shelves for any means. There is a reason these books have been written and published nad it is because they have some meaning and can teach people or give them information on things they would not know otherwise. Taking books off shelves is pretty much just sheltering people, mostly kids, from information that would benefit them no matter in what way. Yes some books talk about sex, and yes some books have offensive terms but unless children are exposed to things like this they will not know that it is wrong. If they do not read books about how slaves were treated, they will never know about the slaves. If they never read a book about a married woman having an affair, they won't understand the significance of cheating. When people read these things they learn about them, and with a little common sense they can understand these things are wrong. Books should not be taken off the shelves in a @CAPS1 at any rate and movies should be looked at in the same manner.     Movies now a days have come along way. Flicks like @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 use such a high form of technology that people would have no idea how it was done just a few decades ago. Some movies due contain very vulgar language and offensive terms and sometimes even nudity, and I can relate to not wanting a little child to see that. This does not mean that these things should be removed from the @CAPS1 though. In all honesty I do not want my little brother or sister walking past a @CAPS5 container with a picture of a girl in lingerie on the front and I do not think anyone else is ok with that. Other movies should be put on display for kids to rent though. Movies that can teach them history although there is very graphic content. Movies that will help them learn how not to do somethings like kill or rape. Movies that can show these things but also teach how incredibly horrible these things are at the same time. I think that the movies that go past this should be put into an adult only section and I do not think any pornography should be put on display anywhere, but movies need to be available to a very high extent. Movies are very good teaching tools and magazines follow that same path.      In the world today we have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1 that are jam packed with information that can better kids from a young age to even people who have been out of school for a while. I feel like some educational magazines @MONTH1 be graphic and show things that children should not see but on the other hand, seeing it will help them understand. Now I am not saying I want to put @CAPS6 magazines on display for people to see and learn about how little of clothes some girls can wear but magazines that @MONTH1 show the very little amount of clothes people are forced to wear in countries in @LOCATION1. They should be able to view magazines that could show, a little more on the nude side, of people who are starving because they only can eat twice a week. Things like this although can be very offensive maybe to some people should be viewed because it can teach. It will show kids that these people need help and they can be those people that help them. Once again pornography should not be available at anytime but other magazines that have an educational aproach but could contain some naughty things due to the teaching should be able to be heard. Magazines should be available but on the other hand you have to take a more careful approach to music.      Music is probably the hardest to figure out, of these censored things I have spoken of today. People use music to express feelings. Whether those feelings are good or bad they get them out through song. Music is something that brings people together and allows them to be unique at the same time. Music should not be taken away from people going into a @CAPS1 because of its vulgar content or anything of that matter. There is a thing called the 'clean' version of pretty much any song that has curse words in it. Songs that cannot be cleaned up or are not available in that way I can undertstns why they are taken off the sheleves but other than that I think everything should be made available. Music can be so powerful to people and taking it away is not the right thing to do.     In conclusion the censorship should not be done. Yes there are somethings that have to be removed due to the extremeness contained in it but if things can be learned from I feel like it should stay no matter what. People go to a @CAPS1 to learn and there are so many tools that can be used to teach them. Music, movies, magazines, and books can be such a big part of peoples lives and taking these things from them is not right",4,4
4131,"Would you censor the @CAPS1? i @CAPS2 i sure would not. The @CAPS1 is a very percious and religoius part of our nation and history, but this is just a mere example. There are thousand of books, newpapers, articles, and media that play and important role in the history and the future of human beings.     Common sense or also referered as common knowledge is something that we dont pick up outa no where. We absoub it thought this that do, see, and read. An example is the 'The @CAPS4 @CAPS5' this is a book of a @CAPS5 that meets a young boy and the @CAPS5 is just thrilled to be of purpose for the boy. Throught out the story the @CAPS5 gives the boy its apple, its branches, and even its trunk. but the @CAPS5 is happy. at the very end of the story they former young boy is now a old man that just wants a place to rest so the @CAPS5 straightens up his stumb and is just happy with @CAPS4 the old man his happiness. Now would you censor that?! That story reflects that helping someone is a key to life. That @CAPS4 someone else happiness is the true gift of life.      Now relegion is something that is censored alot these day... Why?! The @CAPS1 for example is just a book full of short stories that ties together. Indivigle tha stories are just little reminders of right and wrong,  kindness and jelousy. Its doesnt say if you have to follow every word and every sentence by day and night. its just helpfull advise, And really who has not asked someone else for advice? @CAPS8 relgion on tv, in schools, and everywhere else is telling us we dont need relegion for us to be productive and honest. Me coming from a roman catholic and christian background have never really went to church or read the @CAPS1 am swelled up about relegion. Thanks to a close friend.     @CAPS8 could also be good at its points though. For an example @CAPS8 adult type content from minors is helpfull sence little kids dont @CAPS2 much of anything. They just go with the flow. Another example is @CAPS8 mail sent to different countries. This helps keep our country safe from invasion and war.      so i will say that @CAPS8 can be a good thing but too much of it can be bad. Such as @CAPS8 relegious content, or @CAPS8 classical book that teach you common knowledge that will help aid you in the future. This stuff is something that should be @CAPS10 by ages and ages to come!",3,3
3832,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work i abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson said this about the topic of book censory in the library. This is a very tricky subject because no one will ever be happy. All books, music, movies, magiznes, etc.can be considered offensive to someone.      When it comes to books in the library we should have sections. One for @CAPS3, child, family, activity, romance, etc. if we have thoes then it would cut down on what books children can look at. One time I went to @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 and I accidently wondered into the @CAPS3 books section. I knew that I was not suppost to go into that section, but if they had it marked that it was the @CAPS3 Books section then I would not have gone in there.     Parents need to moniter what there kids look at, or even what part of the library they go into. If a child wonders into the romance section then they are going to see that kind of book it is not the librarys fault or even the fault of the writer. If the parent does not want to moniter what the child looks at they could set boundries. they could say 'Do not leave this section.'. If my mom said that to me i would stay around the child books. The parents could moniter the child to solve the problem.     Library's need to decide what kind of books they are going to have in the library. If the library does not have the kind of books you do not want your child to see then your child can not look at that book. If your public library does keep thoes books in the open the parents could always go to a town hall and tell the mayor, librarian, or other towns people about the rude books. If you tell people the library has that kind of books then others will stand up aginst the books.     If you do not like what the library has on the shelfs, suggest sections for the books, keep watch of what your kids look at, or tell someone that can do something about the problem. What are you going to do to improve you public library? how are you going to make you kids not go and look at the books you dont want them to see",4,4
3651,"The censorship in a library should be kept the same as it is already.  A few reason explain why the censorship is alright as it is.  Those reason are That the parents should be in charge of the books their children read, that not all people agree on censorship, and that the libraries have books of different subjects that people like to read.     The first reason is that parents shoud be in charge of what their children read.  If the parents would just tell their children no to a certain book, then the child will not read it.  If the parent does not want their child to go into a section then, the parents can just say keep away from that area.  Although, sometimes the child @MONTH1 stray away from its parents it is not very likely that the parent will not notice.  That is why the parents should be in charge of what their children read.     The second reason is that not all people agree on censorship.  Certain people think that religion is important no matter what the book shows, but others would think parts of religious book (nudity, swears, etc...) is extremely innapropriate.  Some people would say that books like @CAPS1 mythology books are innapropriate and need to be censored, although others think these books are past culture and that they should remain in the libraries forever.  Most children will look at these books and think that the books are to big to read, so they would not even look at them.  Few people would agree on censorships, and a lot of people would disagree.     The third reason is that libraries have different subjects than the innapropriate books.  The people can look at a different book and completely ignore the others.  It is not like a child will go up to the dirtiest book they can find and say '@CAPS2 I want to read that one.' the child will probably want something that relates to a television show or a movie of some sort.  The point being that a person can read other books than just innapropriate books.     Library books should be kept the same because the parents should be in charge of what their children read, not all people agree on censorship, and libraries have different subjects that people want to read. The censorship should be fine according to some people other would disagree.  The children probably would not look at the innapropriate book anyways, because they would not interest the child.",4,4
4269,"Censorship in libraries differ in certain areas. I personally love reading, and like all kinds of books. And I know that there are some books that I have read that my parents would not aprove of. But has that ever stopped me? Not exactly.     I think that after a certain age, people should be aloud to read whatever they want. I mean, if I ever thought I could not be mature enough to read a certain book. Then I will not get or read the book, it is that simple.      As far as music, movies, and magazines go that could be a different story. Music is for the most part like a book, just using a different one of your senses. And it is listened to, not read. Movies should be judged a little more carefully in my eyes, because movies are like show and tell. That could easily go wrong if children, teens, etc take it more than just a movie.      I think all things should not be judged by assumption. Everyone has different opinions and likes. So, therefore material should not be removed from shelves, if there are people that like/support what the book, movie, or music has to offer.",3,3
3667,"Why should they take them off the shelves? If you ask me i think they should leave @CAPS1 up their. I think they should leave @CAPS1 up there. Not only is @CAPS1 happening in the libraries its happening on televisions also.     Everything in the library might not offend some people. Some people take @CAPS1 offensive when they see something thats against their religion, culture, or maybe their country. But we have the people that take certain things in the library offensive but don't worry about @CAPS1. I say, 'If  you check out the library and find something that you take offensive, don't get @CAPS1 just beacuse you don't like @CAPS1 doesn't mean other people won't like @CAPS1. So why waste time trying to fight to get @CAPS1 off the shelves when @CAPS1's really you the only person worried about @CAPS1?' @CAPS1 just doesn't make any sense how people put up a fit because a certain material offended them. Like someone said a pastor was on tv, talkin about how bad hell really is since some people don't think @CAPS1's not going to be all that bad. He was on tv at the time and this lady got offensive about @CAPS1 and had them take him off tv. But she didn't havve to watch him on tv, she could of watched something else. Nobody made her watch @CAPS1, she chose to watch @CAPS1.     So what I'm saying is that just like the author of the newspaper said, 'I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor, then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 that if you want something off the shelf, think about the other people that actually want to use @CAPS1 rather than thinking about just you.",2,3
4208,"One @MONTH1 subject the censorship of library content in certain places and times, whether fictional or not, to his or her own opinion.  I personally disagree with the concept.  The facts point out that society fears the dystopia predicted by publications exploring the outcome of similar campaigns and has instated systems designed to prevent such occurrences.  Certain examples stand in play to explicate my opinion.       Society, at least in my native @LOCATION1 and surely abroad in other democratic countries, dislikes enforced censorship for a few reasons.  First, many countries have a @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 and priviledges upheld in the face of the law.  Our founding fathers wrote out one of the documents establishing this trend on the prompting of the general public.  The first ten ammendments to our fine constitution, bundled as the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, resulted.       Some of the included statements ensure the freedom to speak as it publicly pleases us as citizens and the freedom to write, individually and collectively without boundaries.  The removal of these principles so ingrained in our nation's conscience would cause a general uproar.  We as a people instituted our government to preserve our freedoms, and we could prepare ourselves to replace it as implied in the @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 if so required of us to continue doing just that.       Secondly, publications such as the ones mentioned for banning rebuke the enforcement of opinion for its effects on society.  I can mention three books portraying this dystopic outlook on censorship.  '@CAPS5 @NUM1,' required by state standards for one possible choice of reading assigned to us by my teacher, describes book burning and utmost uniformity between citizens.  '@DATE1,' by @PERSON2, I know describes a dystopia in which all citizens completely submit their will to and omnipotent '@CAPS6 @CAPS7,' who utilizes omnicient surveillanceeven though I have not read the composition myself.  '@CAPS8 @CAPS7,' a recent novel by @PERSON1 whose title employs a pun on the name of @DATE1's prime antagonist, weaves the exciting tale of an older teenager who tries to beat the system of surveillance from under the radar.  All, however, betray a sense of fear in their content, and that fear has transferred directly into local civilization.       In reviewing the aspects of censorship portrayed in its effects, the system itself reveals that the even the intended creation of a utopia and compliance through censorship @MONTH1 result in decline and misery throughout the area within which government or civil officials practice the method.  In any case, a more effective solution must exist today.  To prove the point, let me introduce some content advisory systems currently in place.       Libraries divide themselves into sections for the various age groups, and therefore create an inherent barrier between differing groups of content deemed appropriate only in the face of maturity.  The film and television industries rely on ratings displayed at various times during video to provide the same sort of psychological fence dividing content into pieces.  Even the video game industry, into which I plan to inject myself upon exiting college, has a system in place to separate existing media into tiered subcategories designed in a similar way to film ratings.  Different regions utilize different systems, but that of  the @ORGANIZATION3, or the @ORGANIZATION1 for the @ORGANIZATION2, compares relatively well in ranking video games to the rest of the globe.       As explained, censorship already exists in a form accptable to all.  Nobody forces anybody to comply to the recommendations, but hopefully everyone does so on their honor.  Capable parents most definely follow the guidelines which have cropped up over the years.  Only if these methods of moderation were enforced would everyone be upset.  It's up to everyone to prevent a situation like unto the worst-case scenario and useresponsibly the systems available for this purpose",5,5
3127,"There are many books in the library that shouldn't be there. From books about racism, violence, or pornagraphy I wouldn't want my young children to be able to take those type of books out of the library.     A library in a school is a great way to help sudents with projects, essays, or just to read. If my child was in elementry or even middle school , I wouldn't at all want them to be able to check out a book about things they shouldn't even know about yet. If my teenager was in high school though, I wouldn't mind that because they are old enough to realize the things that actually go on in the world. They also could be doing a project over the wrongs of pornagraphy, in which the library is better place to find a book then the interent that could take them to many bad websites. Since I go to my local high school I think its nice to be able to find anything I need in my library at school. It makes it easier to work on projects.      Also in libraries there are a ton of music, movies, and magazines. If a library has educational music, why not keep them in there? If the music is rap, pop, or country they could just get it from @CAPS1 instead of the library providing it. Magazines can also be educational. If you are doing a project on fashion a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 would be excellent to help them find out some tips. Magazines can also have some inaproprate things in them. Since all they talk about in the media is sex, sex articles would probably be in the magazines. Whenever I look in magazines I just skip all of that nonsense they talk about and read the articles about clothes, food, and people. Exposing that to young children wouldn't be the best, but for teenagers they understand. Movies shouldn't be in the library unless they are educational too. There are a ton of @CAPS4 around that those scary movies don't need to be in a library.     In conclusion I think it all depends on what kinds of kids are going into the library. For young children, stay with the cartoon educational type things. For teenagers, keep it educational but be more relaxed about it. If something offends you, go have a talk with the libraian they woukd probably be happy to take it off the shelf.",3,3
3079,"I think that books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be aloud to stay on the shelves of stores and libraries. We have to ask our selves these questions. Why should we take them out of libraries? What would people have to read when those books tell us about what went on in the early days, such as slavery, automobiles, and etc.? Who wants to sit and read about other stuff that is just down right boring?     Why should we take down the books in the library? We shouldn't take the books down off the shelves. We @MONTH1 have the right to take down the books but why should we. It is taking away the knowledge for our children. We would be taking away a lot of stuff the our children should know about, such as the slavery, and famous people.     What would we have to read about if we took most of the books out of the library? We would have nothing to read about other then the stuff that doesn't matter to us anymore. You have to think about if we took all of the books that were inappropraite off the shelves of the library there wouldn't be anymore books. Every book out there has something bad in it, so we would have to take away all the books other than the little kids books.      Who would want to go to the library and want to sit there knowing that they are going to be reading something that is not interesting and just boring? I can tell u who wants to do that. Nobody,'' it's just dumb to do it and has no point, unless you are old, then you @MONTH1 like to, but not everybody is old. Reading is fun to some kids and they want to read about different stuff, but if we take the books they can't.      We don't need to take any books out of the libraries? There would be no reason to go to the library or even read books, cause there isn't any good ones. We are just taking away something that is really big to us @CAPS1, and without those books there is no history for us to study. Our kids need to see those books even if we don't want them to. That is the early days and they need to know about all of it and how it was back then when they didn't have everything we do now. You can't take away something that is fun to do so why take them",3,3
3776,"Without books we all would not know what we know now.Its just like saying without a heart your body will still function. Books today are basically telling you real life things that happen or can happen if you do anything. Personally books are made for a reason, whether some people like it or not. Books help you get a better understanding of many things someone else @MONTH1 not know,and or understand.The same thing goes for musis, movies, and magazines.      I clearly understand where some parents, guardians, and caregivers come from, but they have to realize that everything they think is wrong for our society today really is helping the next person. Also someone else is thinking different then they are. Books are another way of learning as well, they all are not bad for the younger or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. They also help you get a better meaning of alot of things. I am not only going to say that books are most peoples main problem, but there are some movies, music,and magazines. But some tell you what age it is suitable for. For movies they tell you things like '@NUM1, @CAPS1' and other things like that. Also for music all you have to do is look at the songs on the back or they have them with or without anything bad on it. Magazines they have many different varieties of things for all ages and you pick the ones you want for you or your child.     Everything is not all bad, it is what you feel is right for your child or whosoever it @MONTH1 be. You can not blame others for what they feel needs to be heard or said to some. You have to look outside the box and know that there are people who really need to hear, see, and or do. Just to better themselves as a individual. People are so quick to judge the next but really don't try to understand that everyone needs help and that just because your life or whatever @MONTH1 seem to be heading in the right direction at that time doesn't mean someone elses can't change.Those things are there for a reason if you dont like it then try a better way to get away from it.     Without those things in our life I really can see this world falling apart. We barely understand what some of the books, music, movies, and magazines are talking about so just try to  picture all that being taken away. Its not a pretty site, accept the things that we have now and use them to the best of your ability. They all are there for a reason.",4,3
3897,"I believe that if you find a book offensive then you should not read that book. What some people find as offensive some other people might find it not offensive. I do not think that people should not be able to take books off of the shelves.     For example if there is a person of the jewish religion they might find a book about hitler offensive. In that sense if they take the book off of the shelf then the other kids that are soon to come into the age of studying this era will not have a book to look at. Without these books our history of the world will be soon forgotten.     Another example would be slavery. I believe that slavery is a hard subject to come to grips with. In the reality it was a hard time for the africans. I do not think that they will take the books off of the shelf because of it being offensive. How could you take away the future of learning from the children that are our next generation.      If we are to take the books off of the shelves at the libraries what do we do about the bible. Some people do not believe that there is a god or a heaven, but a lot of other people do believe in it. So how would that work out in the long run? it would create a lot of problems for the public library and for its citizens as well.      In reading books as a kid i have found that some things are bad and i do not like them, but i dont believe that we should take the book away from people that like the books.How do you take away from the people that like to read different nopvels than you is beyond me, but it will only be a problematic subject in the future.                                                  this is an essay by @PERSON1",4,4
3683,"Should there be censorship in libraries? People think that there should be and some think it shouldn't matter. I think there shouldn't be because maybe some people like those books. I have three reasons why there shouldn't be censorship. My reasons are first people like certain books and should be able to get what ever they want. Second, the libraries should be able to put what ever they want on the shelfs. Third, if you don't like what the books say then don't get the book.      Libraries have many books for you to choose from and you can pick which book you want to check out. Libraries don't need to censor their books because some people might want books like that. Everybody has there own preference on the kinds of books and music that they like. Censorship wouldn't allow them to get what they want which would make them mad. There is all kinds of genres of books and music around, some have more strong language in them then other genres. Some people like their music uncensored and should be able to get it. Libraries and entertainment stores are the ones who buy the books and music not you.     Libraries have the freedom to get what ever books they want to and put them on shelves. If you don't like what certain books or music say then go get something you do like. There is no rule that says you have to get a certain kind of music. Some people like the music genre called rap which does have some strong language in it but its your choice to listen to it. the stores just put the products on the shelf to make money not to get you angry about what the products say. There are sections on the shelves that say what genre they are.     People that want to say something about what the language is like in the book should not have checked it out. You have the right to ask what certain music, books, or movies are like, and movies have ratings on the case. Music and movies have ratings which tell you how strong the language is on the cases. People can not say to monitor that when it tells you everything thats in the movie or @CAPS1. The libraires and stores usually mark the sections on what genre they are. That can tell you where the uncensored parts are. You can stay away from those sections if you find them offensive.      The libraries should not have to censor there books and entertainment store should not need to censor all the music and movies. Its your choice what to get not theirs. People can stay away from those areas that they find offensive. Everybody should be able to get what they want even if it might offend others.",4,4
4027,"I think certain books such as offensive books shouldn't be remove. I dont think so because that's how some kids learn better and read better. Kid's dont like reading boring books. Things like music, movies, and magazines are interesting to us.      If this world didn't have movies kids wouldn't read books. Most of these kids now a days read books because they watch the movie to the story. Some kids like listening to music while reading. I'm glade people invited these thing's. I feel like if people didn't invited these things this world would be boring.     Magazines are also great because they help people start to read books and so on. Magazines are entataining to people. I say they are because they have pictures, glossip, and much more. Magazines are good to read it help alot of people to read better.     It's also bad because kids read it and start doing what they say in the magazine. Some books are good some are bad. I say that because some books get out of control with cursin and the cover of the books well pictures. Some arthurs write good things and some write bad things.     Hope you get something out of what i wrote. This is how i feel about books, magazines, music, and movies. I love to read and listen to all of them. I enjoy books alot.                             P.S  @ORGANIZATION1",4,3
4662,"When people think of a library they think of a quiet place to study and read. Teachers use the libraries for many different things. One thing they use it for is movies on certain topics. Another is for books on certain people or events. They even use it to get magazines for projects and to catch up on the world outside of school. So what is my opinion on offensive materials getting removed? I'll tell you what it is.     Kids watch movies in class all the time. Some are not appropriate at times, but some are very insiteful and helpful. I think if the teacher watches the movie first and thinks that it is too bad for children in say elementary it should be banned from that schools library, but for high schoolers chances are they have heard or seen worse. So with saying that movies should stay in the libraries of high schools but not all should stay in the elementary's.     Books are another good resource if used correctly. They help kids in history learn about old war hero's and past events. Some books should be kept behind the counter and only used for certain classes though. Like for instance books that tell specifics about drugs. They should be taken off the shelves , put behind the counter; and if someone really needs a book about them like for medicine purposes to become a doctor then all they have to do is ask.     Magazines are good for a couple of different nice things. One thing is projects. If you have to do a project over something like food and cant use a computer, magazines are a great way to get good pictures. Another thing its commonly used for is just flat out entertainment. Like when you get bored of reading a book that you just picked out because of looks or if a book is too hard to read you could get a magazine.     So in reality some things should be kept and others taken away. People spend lots of time in the library for many different things and that will never change. Movies are a good source of entertainment and that won't change either. So I guess i'm half and half on keeping or getting rid of offensive materials.",3,4
4628,"Should there be censorship in libraries? Many people will answer this question differently. I feel there should be absolutely no censorship in libraries.     Allowing censorship in libaries is an intrusion of our rights. It contradicts freedom of the press. If someone wants there opinion to be read they should have that right.     I also feel censorship in libraries goes against freedom of speach. What is writing, but written speach?  If someone wants to say something, they should be able to say it. If a mute person wants to get a point out, they should be able to do so by writing.     What some people @MONTH1 consider offensive, others @MONTH1 not. If someone finds it offensive, they should simply not read it",3,3
3339,"There are so many books and magazines, music, and movies to be discovered in this world. Some are funny, sad, wierd, scary, etc. And then there are some that are questionable to others on wheather it was even nessecary to even put the the material on the shelf of a library in the first place. I for one am not one of those people who would question a book, magazine, movie or music. I believe that everyone's voice needs to be heard somehow and if we all take a voice away that we do not like, then we will lose a lot of voices.     We are all entitled to our own opinion. When it comes to some things some are more opinionated than other, but in the end we all have something that we feel strongly about. There are some people who want to express their feelings with the whole world with people that understand and agree with what they feel. If we take that away from people, then how will we all connect? Some things @MONTH1 come across as offensive to others, but who has the right to say that something should not be shared with the rest of the world. I have observed that when people have the same interests in things like music, books, or movies then it gives people a way to come together and talk about something. I have witnessed at concerts everybody seems to connect because we are all there for the same reason, to see the band or person that we all like to listen to. Everybodys different and likes to have their own personal preference on something. Like Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I think she was trying to say that if we all take a book off the shelf that we do not think should be on there, then there is going to be nothing left for anybody to read. Then what will we do?      Theres such a variety of materials that are needed to be discovered wheather it is a book, music, or movie everyone has their own special type that they enjoy. I do not think that censorship is a good idea for any sort of material on a shelf. Theses materials are what keep people connected with each other. I think it is very important to not censor anything because it does not just give the writer a voice, it give a voice for the people that agree with the material of the book, movie, or music",4,4
4429,"Do you find books you read offensive?  How about music, or magazines?  I sure don't.  I can't think of why someone would be offended about a book they chose to read.  If you sit back and think about it, there should be a low amout of reasons that someone should be offended by a book that is written for the general public.       I believe that it is possible for there to be books that have offensive words or actions in them, but unless they are directed towards the reader, or intentionally being used to offend someone then it is just a book.  A lot of books, especially ones on history, use language and actions that were used during that time.  They use them to show you and inform you on how things used to be and what it was like during the time.  Not very often, or that I have ever seen, do the authors make a book to just to put someone down.  I tend to see books just explaining things and using offensive words just to show how things were and to set a tone of the book.     Music on the other hand could be thought of as different.  Many people could take music in the wrong way.  A majority of offensive problems spawning from music come from the genre of rap.  Rappers tend to express themselves throughly, and in doing that often times use very offensive language.  I personally don't get botherd by the music, because they are usually refering to their own life and how things went with them.  Music can also be on the good side too.  When you get the calm and collective music, it tends to help people and can be used to help people relax.  Therefore music can be either way, but it mostly goes about who the person is and how they react to what they listen to.     Then you have magazines.  Personally I think they are the worst of all.  Magazines tend to go one way or the other.  They either put a person down and be completely negative towards them, or they are positive and say nothing but good about them.  One big problem with magazines is that they write down what they hear and what they want to hear, not always knowing the full story.  In that case they have a very high chance of being very offensive towards the person or group they are talking about.  Magazines always have a positive, but where there is a positive they have a harsh negative thing to put in with it.       In these regaurds, I believe that there is nothing wrong with a library.  There are always going to be negatives and positives, but libraries tend to stick with the positive side.  Plus if a book looks like it might end up being offensive towards you, then there is no one that can tell you that you can't just put it down and stop reading it.  With music, only get stuff that you like and if you are easily offended don't listen to that music.  Libraries just give you the opportunity to possibly get something you could enjoy.  There is no reason someone would not be able to refrain from going in and getting an offensive book. In saying this, it can go either way.  I don't believe there is anything worng with libraries censorship as long as you can use your own good judgement.",4,4

For highschoolers of @NUM1 or older will be alright to read. Highschoolers understand and has heard these words more than once before. If a teacher gives this book to a @NUM2 grader they would not understand the full potential it hold for the learning of it. Childern in that age range will not understand that the man is handicaped, then the childern would not understand the killing the handicaped man had done or why his friend killed him after it.      Will a parent let a @NUM3 year old read a smut novel? This depend on the way the parent was raised and how the feel it will effect the childs development. An @PERSON1 book would not be approprent for a child of that age for the child does not, and will not understand the book it self. The book is more then just that one part of smut.

Everyone has heard this saying. This say is said but its not followed. Young adults play video games, read books in school related to @CAPS4. '@ORGANIZATION1's don't @CAPS5' is a book of a colored teenagers going to a white school. This is a book giving the kids to see how things were. A child in elematenry would think its funny if a cartoon is played for them and someone gets hit. The children will is it a game and do not have enough background or maturity to under stand what is really happening and that it is wrong to do that. For just watching a tv show with hit or punch the child will think it is ok to do it.     Over all there will be @CAPS4, cursing and smut novels out there. The thing it depends on the parents and maturity level of the person/child. There is a wrong and right way to do it but for @CAPS1 it not right to let some underage read a curse, voilents, or smut",3,4
4390,I believe that things shouldn't be taken off the shelfs because a few people are offended. There @MONTH1 be a few that don't like something but for every few that don't like it there are some who do. For example there might be a book that makes females look dumb but personally it doesn't affect me but there are some girls who get offended because thier superior knowledge.     I have a friend who gets offended by movies that the black guy always gets in trouble or dies first. So if we removed every movie that offended him what would be left. I feel offensive when a magazine shows girls are pretty because it makes people feel insecure about themselves. Even though I feel offended I'm not going to request them to remove it because there are some magazines that give tips and actually helps people feel better about themselves and if I took that away from them it could cause issues.     If there is something that is removed from shelves it should have a good reason. Like if there was a magazine that showed nudity I would understand them removing it so a kid doesn't see it.Some libraries remove things that could potentially cause a great issue. Maybe a newspaper talks about a great disaster and every one swarms the stand attacking each other. Something like that can cause people to be hospitalized and then the library will be sued.     Yes I agree that there are some people who would request the  stuff to be removed but you can't always get your way. I know people would say thats not fair but there is a saying that says 'life isn't fair' and thats true. So next time you hear some one wanting something removed tall them this or next time you want some thing removed you refer back to this.     So in conclusion things shouldn't be removed unless nessecary. So when someone is offended thats their problem. You can always walk away you dont have to look or listen.,4,4
3185,"Book Censorship?          Should books be censored? This a national problem about the contents of books. It is a big deal. What one parent feels is very offensive another @MONTH1 feel it has a necessary life lesson that their children need to learn.     If you ask me thaqt question I would say, '@CAPS1 I believe the books should ,but to a national scale and not a community one.'@CAPS2 this I mean a book with things like references to nudity or other things of volgur nature ,not just because it has a bad word in it that a parent feels to be inappropiate for their child. I believe there should be a national rating system for books like there is in the movie industry.      Also i believe that it is the parents' job to regulate what their children read. If they believe the book is vulgar or inappropiate but the system don't then you need to prevent their children from reading it without taking it off the shelf. It is the parents' job to regulate the reading of their children not the contents of the bookshelf.     Like in Katherine Paterson's @CAPS3 ' All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any children have taken off the shelf. But if I had the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 this I believe she means that if we all took a book of the shelves for our children there would be no books because what is not offensive to you @MONTH1 be very offensive to another parent. So the parents should leave it on the shelf and prevent their own kids from reading it and let the other parents worry about their own kids.     @CAPS1 I believe in a goverment censorship program but to an extent. It is the parents' job to regulate the readings of their children ,but they do not need to regulate the contents of the bookshelf",4,4
3856,"The library is a place for people to go and read whatever they want. Some people just enjoy reading and others go to find information. People are allowed to read and write whatever they want and sometimes it might offend others but there's nothing you can really do about it.      Sometimes there might be inapropriate books at the library or the super market but even if it doesnt apply to you it might to someome else, for instance say there's a book or magazine talking about being homosexual and you dont think it should be allowed but someone who is might find it interesting to see how other people deal with it.        Another topic most people argue about is books about sex or drugs. Adults who have children don't want them reading about those things and in some ways they might because in a book it might show the reader how there bad for you and that you shouldnt do them. I know I ike reading books like that because it just shows me how it messes peoples lives up and I dont want to live like that.     There are some things I dont think should be allowed like books, magizines, music, and movies about racialism. I don't think its right for people to talk about others just because there skin is a different color, they have just as much right to be here as we do. Another thing that bothers me are movies about people that have problems like adhd or down syndrome and other kids bullying them because its not there fault there like that and its just inapropriate.   Some people don't realize what they write might hurt others  and sometimes they write them for that purpose and even though we @MONTH1 complain about them no good ever comes out of it because everyone has a freedom of speech and we just have to deal with it and go on with our lives. And if there are inapropriate things at the library you dont like or don't want your children to see then don't let them go.",4,4
3156,"I am a citizen of the @LOCATION1 and I believe that the censorship on the material in libraries is not good but it could be better. It should be an age limit on certain books and magazines ect. in the library. Somethings younger children shouldn't be able to read because of the maturity level. I remember taking my little sister to the public library and she got a book and began to ask me some words that she shouldn't even be hearing about now.      On the other hand, those books @MONTH1 be needed. Some people need those types of books and magezines for research papers and things like that. Now I consider myself a young adult and I believe that other children my age could read about different things and know whats right from wrong. Its also up to the parent or gaurdian of the child , if you feel that you dont want your child to read anything thats not appropriate then go with them to the library. But then some children dont have a mature parent or gardian that would tell them what to read and what not so thats when the library should do something about the censorship on the books.     Well I jus wanted to write you this because like I stated before the censorship on the books, movies, music, magazines, ect. in the library is ok but it could be jus a little better. There should be a certain age when a child reads or see's certain things. But you can't just take all the books and things out the library that are not appropriate because some people actually need the books. Thats why I believe that it would help if the library had a age limit or made certain things for mature audiance only.",4,3
4333,"Do I believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think it should matter weather we have music, movies or magazines in the library. Some people like to come in the library to relax and look at a magazine or listen to some music.      I do not think it bothers anybody by what other people are doing there, if it is not bothering them it should not bother anybody else. I see people sometimes reading a book and listening to music. it does not bother me when they do this. It is a way for them to drown out the world and enjoy a good book.     There is only one reason why we should keep certain materials out of the library. It is that some people get very loud when there looking at magazines, or when there music is turned up way to loud. Other than that I do not think we should keep those types of materials in the librarys.      I am a reader my self and I like to read in peace. So I like to listen to my music while I am reading. I also like to read magazines every once and awhile. It is real relaxing to me.     Those are my reasons on why it should not matter weather we have those types of materials in the library",3,3
3546,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern;      As a student, I find myself reading frequently: at home, at school, in the library, in the car, basically any place I can get my hands on a novel. However, the novels that I have read are not always novels I have chosen for my personal gain. I must admit, I am not an avid reader on my own. I am the kind of student that enjoys reading a book that interests me. Many of the books I choose are relatable to reality, which often involves content that @MONTH1 be considered explicit. I believe books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be taken off shelves.      As @CAPS1 citizens, we have the right to free speech. This allows us the freedom to speak our mind and express our thoughts without restricting our personalities.This law allows authors and producers the right to base their work on what they want. Media that @MONTH1 be considered explicit is appealing to a variety of people, and to some it is considered disturbing. With the freedom we have as @CAPS2, we have the choice to see said movies, or read said books, but we also have the choice to avoid those situations. When producers produce movies containing sexual content, language, or violence, they aren't producing the movie, expecting every citizen to see it. They know some citizens are against that content. There is no law forcing us to see movies that we do not desire to see. We have the ability to choose what we want and do not want.      Explicit material is available everywhere you look. Walking in @LOCATION2 and @LOCATION3, we see books, music, and magazines lining the walls, most containing explicit material. Though many novels contain explicit material, there are still numerous amounts that do not. People complain about explicit content in novels when in actuality, there are many novels without explicit content. We are trained as humans to look for the bad in situations. We lead pessimistic lifestyles. Citizens need to learn to realize not everything is terrible. Look for the good in situations. There is an abundance of media that contains no explicit content or sexual material and we are given warnings as to what contains and does not contain this material. These warnings are required! Labels such as @CAPS3 or @CAPS4 are set to prove that the following is open for general audiences with and without parental supervision. Parents have the authority to monitor what their child involves himself or herself in. They can set rules for their children, saying they @MONTH1 only see @CAPS3 rated movies, or they have to have parental consent to read a magazine or novel. Parents are guardians for a reason; they need to monitor their child and care for him or her. If they do not like the music, novels, movies, etc. that their child watches, change it! They have the authority and right to do so. Instead of taking explicit material off the market to everyone, limit what you, personally, want to be off limits to your family on your own, and talk to them about it!     Katherine Paterson is completely correct when she says, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf. . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we were given the right to remove and books, movies, magazines, etc. that we do not believe should be on the market, it is likely that we would have no media anymore. With the billions of citizens we have in @LOCATION1 alone, each individual is bound to find some flaw in a certain book. With each flaw found, we would want to eliminate that book, movie, or magazine from society, thus leaving us with no variety of material to choose from. People who feel strongly about eliminating explicit material would act quickly upon this law, rather than people who are against it. This would create a corrupt society, with a lot of fighting. We, as humans, enjoy the freedoms we are given and the choices we are allowed to make. Taking the freedom of what we read or watch away from us would take away or personality and sense of expression. Books, movies, and magazines are meant to be read based on opinion, and it should remain that way.     Books, movies, and magazines should be allowed to stay on the market even when they include explicit material. The choice to read or watch this material is up to the person, and should have no influence on other humans opinions.",4,4
3050,"NO, I dont think music.movies.magazines, and etc., should be moved from libraries because whats a libaray with only books? In even though you have to read and be quity and be seated. You can have music while on the computer and you can watch and check out movies you @MONTH1 like. And the magazines to keep you updated with the newest fashion on new looks or something thats going on and our community.Music is what you wont to listen when you come to the libary. It smoothing up the vibe and if you @MONTH1 be and a bad mood that music you @MONTH1 like @MONTH1 claim you down in put you and a better one. It relax you. You can be on the computer and still listen to music. While reading a good book you can be listing to music.Movies is a good source when and the libary. You can watch movies while and the libary and check some out. In take home and watch. You can watch all types of movies. Movies you @MONTH1 like and it also can be movies you @MONTH1 need for a project or even educatoinal movies. If you wont to leran about nature, animals,or even a @CAPS1 person from the @DATE1. Its always good for a movie and the libary.Magazines and a libary is very helpful. Because while you @MONTH1 be waiten on something or it could be on the computer you can seat and grab a magazine. In the libary its a varity of magazines you can read like sports,fashion,nature,cartoon,animals and etc. So magazines is very helpful and a libary.Thats why i say no, because it shoudnt be removed from  libraries becouse you can do lots of great things and the labary besides just reading a book and getten on a computer. Movies magazines and music is helpful and a libary to. Who just wont to get on a computer and read a book. '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'.",2,3
4624,"Censorship in libraries is a very controversial topic that has conflicting views. One side, in favor of censorship, believes that some literary material contained within a library could be offensive to some, and that it should be removed or censored. The other side, in favor of free speech, believes that all literary material in a library should be kept, whether it is seen as offensive or not. Of these two sides of such a controversial issue, it is evident that censorship should not be instilled within libraries, because of the right to free speech, the true meanings and expressions must be upheld, and it would take the oppurtunity to read such a work truly from an interested reader.     The first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because of the right to free speech. This right belongs to all citizens of @LOCATION1, and shouldn't be taken away because one person @MONTH1 think something is offensive. I have observed that many people will often attempt to steal this right from people, and this instillation of censorship will do just that to the authors. This is the first reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because this censorship @MONTH1 dull down the true meanings and expressive themes that literary works are meant to express. An example of a story that would suffer from censorship is the famous 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1.' Such a novel, though containing offensive language at times, would not read the same if such language was omitted and removed. Instead, @PERSON1's expressions within the story would be dulled down immensely and be nearly silenced. This is the next reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     The last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor is because it removes the availability of the book from an interested reader. Many times I have seen people blatantly have a tantrum over an offensive literary work. I have been offended by things that I have read before, and instead of demanding its removal and crying for a less offensive substitute, I simply either stopped reading the work or read through it anyways. A person must know that the use of offensive language within literary works rarely is intended to attack the reader, but rather to strongly get a point across.  If a person finds the material too offensive to read, then they should simply stop and find a more suitable work. By remaining calm and passive about these things, it keeps the literary work on the shelves in its true form for other people who wish to read it.This is the last reason why the censorship of literary materials within a library is an unjust endeavor.     It is clearly evident that the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is a bad idea as a whole. The decision to censor literary works would be bad because it would strip the author's right to free speech, it would dull down the author's true meanings and expressions, and it would remove the oppurtunity to read such a work from an interested person. The removal or censorship of literary works would be a terrible decision that all would regret in the years to come. This is why the removal or censorship of literary works in a library is an unjust endeavor.",4,5
4260,"Let's say you walk into a public library and you look upon a book that is racist or is offensive to you.  You believe that the book shouldn't be on the shelf so you take it off.  I believe that you have the right to take that book off the shelf.  It isn't just books either; it can be music, movies, magazine, or many others.  The authors have the right of freedom of speech but it can go the other way around too.  There are many reasons why and I will explain this to you.     The first reason why is that the person might not come back to that place.  I mean if somebody walks into a library and trys to find a book to read, do you think they will ever come back if they are offended by one?  A little while back, I was in the library and I noticed a book that was offending.  It was talking jokes about black people.  I believe that isn't right because all people are equal no matter how they look or what they believe.       The next reason is that it could cause rate of the materials to go down.  If somebody gets offensive about a censored material, they are going to report it and cause the rate to drop low.  No library wants to hold books, music, movies, or magazines that have been reported by their community and nobody wants it.  How would the author feel about their material getting reported because of somebody getting offensive by it?  If the author wants to offend anybody, then they shouldn't even bother to publish it.     The last reason is to get rid of the materials.  Nobody wants to look at something that offends them.  How would you feel that you took a movie home to watch the family and it had bad stuff in it and you didnt like it.  You get offended and complain.  Complaining is bad for business especially if its a government building.  If we just get rid of the things that offend people, then we wouldn't have any problems.     I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf if sombody if offended by it.  There are really three main reasons.  One is the the person might never come back to that place. Next, is that it could cause rate success drop down low.  The last is to just get rid of the materials so they are no complains.  Now, what do you believe",3,3

3693,"I understand how some people @MONTH1 get offended by some things they @MONTH1 watch or they might read but that doesn't mean that other people shouldn't be able to know about it because one person doesn't like it. It's kind of a matter of opinion of whether it is offensive or not.      I myself have never really read or watched anything that was completely uncalled for. On just about every movie or music album that is produced they rate it so that you can know who should be watching this movie and who shouldn't. If the movie was made with somekind of offensive parts to it then they put with the rating that yes, their is some rude language and things like that. So just because somebody didn't read close enough to see that their might be something they don't like in the movie shouldn't cause everyone else to not be able to see that particular movie.     Personally I don't find books to be the greatest things but I am sure of that some books or magazines do tend to have something rude or crude in them but it's not always horrible. If someone thinks that the book @MONTH1 be inapproiate for some readers then they could tell a person in charge in the library that maybe they should only be letting certain people be reading that book because of the content. You shouldn't have to throw a book off a shelf because one or two people thought bad about it.     If it was me choosing whether or not to take movies, books, magazines, etc off of the shelfs I wouldn't. I say this because @PERCENT1 of the time things have been rated or in someway approved to be put on general store shelfs. People can simply read details on the back and see that it's not going to bother them in a way or that it could be offensive and they shouldn't be purchasing. If someone complained about a new cd or movie that I personally wanted to see or listen to and it was taken off shelfs I would be upset about it because it probley wouldn't even offened me at all. So no, i completely disagree with the idea of movies or books and music having to stop sales because two or three people were offended by it's content",3,4
3070,"Libraries are very educational. They provide books, movies, magazines, music, and computers for you to locate something you are looking for. I dont think that libraries include anything offensive. If anyone finds anything that a library has that is offensive to them, then they should talk to someone who works there and see if they can come to a solution. It shouldnt be removed because not everyone @MONTH1 find it offensive.          I've been to many libraries in my life and personally, it's amazing all the books, and things for you do there. I've actually gained alot of knowledge at the libraries i've been to because i found so many books that were just amazing. Never, have i ran into something that was offensive to me or anyone else. Everyone is different though, we have all have a different view on things and we all are unique. If a library does have something that's offensive to everyone then maybe it should be removed but like i said earlier if it's not offensive to everyone then it shouldnt be removed.           I personally, think libraries hold so many unique things that if somethings were offensive to people then i'd understand why everyone would want it to be removed. If someone came up to me and said 'hey, i find this music to be very inappropriate for young children to listen to' i would say, 'well, that @MONTH1 be true, but some children do listen to that music, it wouldnt be fair to remove it, just because one person doesn't like it. Now, from my experience theres alot of things that people find offensive but personally, i think it would be outside of a library",3,3
3615,"No because all people like to read different books. Some of the books that people want taken off bookshelves are considered to be part of history.Books help people advance in their reading skills and also help them find new things out. When I was in middle school I always liked to read @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 books. When I asked the librarian if they had any of their books they said no. They thought that kids in middle school shouldn't be reading books with cuss words in them and vilence. I don't think it should matter what kids read because you can't make a kid read something that he's not interested in because everybody is different all people like different types of books. Theres all kinds of books like for example theres mystery books, fiction books, non-fiction books, historical books, etc. The books you use in classrooms are considered books but there not books you read everyday. I think parents should take their kids to the public library to get a book.When I was in elementry and through junior high we had to take reading tests on the computer.In seventh and eighth grade we had to sit around the room and take a book and read it for part of the hour. We also a challenge in middle school to see which school could read the most. That was part of our grade in our english class. It was never a problem for me because i loved to read.Now there are some books that libraries should take off the shelves. For example any book that involves nudity or lots of vilance. Now thats just for kids that are under the age of thirteen. Now there isn't that many of books out there for little kids to read. Theres more adult books than little kids books.All I have to say is that watch what your kids read. Don't keep them from reading books because that will effect them later on in life. If they don't like to read persuade them to try it. I also think that more kids would read if they seen their relatives reading too. Just remember kids and adults of all ages reading is a good thing no matter what you decide to read.",4,4
4013,"I believe that there should be censorship in public libraries. Libraries have families and young children going to them that do not need to see, hear, and read certain things. If people would like to buy inapporpriate reading material, movies, or music they can do that elsewhere. Certain things are acceptable in public libraries and other things are not.     Certain material such at rated @CAPS1 movies and romance novels are not inappropriate or unacceptable. They are meant for adults but they are not showing extremely racy pictures on their covers. Other material, however, most people are not interested in having to see and our young children should not be subjected to that.     People that wish to view, listen to, or read inappropriate material that is not meant for all ages or covers shouldn't even be viewed by young children can and will purchase or find them elsewhere. People that wish to possess these items will find another place to get them besides a public place with families and children. I believe these people reserve the right to view and listen to what they would like but they should be censored in a public library.     Most people don't read inappropriate material in public and most extremely racy movies aren't even shown in theatres so why should you be able to check them out in a public place? Besides that many people do not even want other people to know that they are viewing these objects in the first place so many wouldn't even check them out at a public library.     I also believe that not only should children not be subjected to these things but parents should not be subjected to their children wanting to know what certain things are that they are far to young to know about.     The youth of @LOCATION1 is getting into new things younger and younger daily whether that be drugs or inappropriate magazines so I believe that we should not begin subjecting our children to that at an even younger age than they will already find out about it.",3,3
3410,"I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music,            magazines, ect should be removed from the shelves.              Libraries or any place else. I believe that if someone wanted to          know more information about something the library or the @CAPS2 should be able to provide it for them. Imagine if the           Libraries and the @CAPS1 started putting these materials away, many people wouldnt bother to go to either. The @CAPS2 in my      eyes is a place that shows me where we have been, what we have been threw, and things we have accomplished while we           have been there.In the @CAPS1 could you imagine walking around touring seeing nothing about you past?,'No, I couldn't.          Eventhough things @MONTH1 seem offensive in ones eyes, it could be the history of anothers. Many people now days relie on the           useage of the magazines, books,and music to get information from. I believe that everyone has a right to know what has                happened in their pass to have gotten to their future, so taking away information that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone           else isn't fair. I believe that we should keep all information in lilbraries, @CAPS1, art shows because everything has it's on history behind it, and if we just cover it up we will never know.

3941,"Most people do not think that kids should see certain things if they are found offensive. Like some books, music, movies, and magazines. I do not believe books or any other thing should be removed from libraries shelf.           It should be the parent choice to what their child can look at or listen to. But now days when a child parent or any other authority don't let them do, watch, or listen to something it make  kids want it more. Since they want it more they will find away to do, watch, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be. They will even go behind there parents back and probably won't care if they get in trouble.           With this new generation authority can only limit so much of what children see today. Children see a lot of things that they are interested in and can find it all different types of ways. Computers, televsion, and the radio are three differnt major ways of finding things that maybe offensive but kids are interested in all the time. Young parents i do believe is one of the reasons kids know about these movies, books, music, and magazines. They say things and do things that young people should not know at a young age. That what make kids think its alright when their parents do what ever it maybe. So let it be the parent choice of what there child can see. Cause either way they going to be able to find away to get it.",2,3
4022,"Everywhere I go, there always seems to be something, small or big, that can be considered offensive. Because of these offensive things, there is often censorship in public places. It is acceptable to view non-noncensored materials at your own disgression and privacy, but not very acceptable to do so in public. I believe that censorship is necessary in libraries because of the wide range of audiences, the public materials, and the opinions of certain people.      Libraries are considered public places and have a wide range of audiences. Whether it be children, teens, adults, or elders, some things are inappropriate and should not be accessible to certain people. This is directed mainly to children, however. Like the quote mentioned, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1 put these offensive books in libraries then? Censorship will block out inappropriate parts of books, movies, music, and magazines in order to make these materials more suitable for all age groups.      Because libraries are considered public places, their materials are considered public property. Everyone has the right to these materials. However, not every library will have the book, magazine, or movie you could be searching for due to the fact that it @MONTH1 contain profanity, or inappropriate content. Some people @MONTH1 be against censorship in libraries, but there often is not censorship in bookstores, movie stores, music libraries, etc. If you desire a certain non-censored material, then go purchase it. That way the material will no longer be public, but rather your own and you can do with it whatever you choose.      We now live in a world where everyone voices their opinion freely and you can not be punished for doing so. Libraries are targeted toward every age group and censorship just allows everything to be appropriate for everyone. Certain parents do not allow their children to read certain books, view certain movies, or listen to certain music and this is just because it is their opinion and their parenting. Some parents, on the other hand, do allow their children to partake in inappropriate materials, and that is perfectly fine, because it is their parenting and their children. However, libraries should not have the right to introduce inappropriate things into the lives of children; that should be the decision of the parents or gaurdians.      In conclusion, censorship should be allowed in libraries because of the wide-range audience, public materials, and the strong opinions of the people. Everyone deserves to read, watch, and listen to whatever they choose, but not everyone deserves to be around inappropriate things in public places. Not everyone can be happy, but everyone can be appropriate",4,4
3431,"Every book has a meaning or message that all should know about. Taking a book away from a library shelf can decrease of knowledge from someone that might need that information. Just because a book @MONTH1 have certain views that can be offensive does not mean it should not be allowed on a shelf. A book should not be discriminated by what the contets @MONTH1 have source of a reader. Positive and negative books should all be allowed on shelve for any whom that have an intrested.          As for music and movies that could be place in the same catogoery can be reasonable. Its really not that neccasary to be place in a library because its a place known for peace and quite and relaxation. If music or movies become a hazard then it should not be welcome in the library. Positive side music and movie has a way for some that comfort while having a good book at hand. It is understandable to have a little tone in the with some knowledge within the eyes in a book.      Magazine is another non neccasary object that is place in the library. A magazine can have a mixture of good and negative thing obtain in it. Not all magazine have something that can be use to educate. Most magazine are known for entertainment and update on well known people around the globe. Magazines should be removed from the library.                      The library should be an experience of a learning envirnment and only materials that will be a good help instead entertainment for pleasure. Remove a book from a shelf is like decrease from knowledge that could have been known. As to remove books should not be allowed no matter how or what the content of the book @MONTH1 be. As for music, movies, and magazines should be a limited for usuage in the library.",3,3
3054,"Do you believe libraries should remove items some people find offensive? Do you find some items offensive and want libraries to remove them? @CAPS2 is a major problem that many people don't think about often before acting. Here are some situations many people run into:     If one person finds a @CAPS1 offensive but no one else does, should @CAPS2 be removed? Many libraries contemplate whether or not they should remove an offensive item due to some peoples' opinions. This is because they know people like @CAPS2 and they know people don't; they wonder whether or not they should remove the item because a few people find @CAPS2 offensive, (this can range from books, music, movies, magazines, etc.). People often think they do what is best for everyone by asking the library staff to remove something they think is offensive. Honestly, they're only helping the people that want to have @CAPS2 removed and don't say anything, that is if the library removes the offensive item.     If the library removes the offensive item, they @MONTH1 lose a customer, if they don't remove the item they @MONTH1 lose a customer. So they are faced with a dillemma, 'remove the item or don't remove the item?' @CAPS2's a tough decision to make especially when they @MONTH1 lose more than a few customers based on either choice. So what do they do? They @MONTH1 poll the customers and see what they think, they @MONTH1 do nothing at all, or they @MONTH1 remove the item to keep the person happy. The problem is what happens if @CAPS2's a friend who liked the item and you don't want to hurt their feelings because the item has been there forever and they love @CAPS2 so much, but can't afford to buy @CAPS2 at a store. What do you do then? People often don't want to think of other people's' feelings and/or the decisions they would have to face over something as small as 'an offensive' item, and they say things that they wouldn't normally say just to get said item 'out of their sight.' @CAPS3 is they just don't want to agknowladge other people's' choices, feelingings, opinions, etc.     So what would you do if you found an offensive item at the library? Would you ask for @CAPS2 to be removed? Say nothing? @CAPS2 is your choice in the end, but not all people have the same tastes in books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that you do. So think about other people's' possible feelings, thoughts, opinions in mind before making a decision.",3,4
3129,"Just because I agree with something, do you have to agree too ? Your cousin believing in one thing,means you have to believe in it also? No,not in my opinion, and I hope not in yours either. If you were to see something you find offensive does that have to mean it offends another around you? The world contains things that children agree with and parents do not and this world consists of things that you like and others will not, but that does not make that item or that object invaluable or offending, and not the least bit inappropriate.      Objects containing so called offensive material are always going to exist in the world we live in and they have for a while. They are going to be everywhere;in stores , in schools, inside, outside , they are all around, and there is no reason for them to be a problem. They will not disappear and that is nothing we want to have to worry about,that could become a criminal offence of any sorts. So why fight it,well I say we don't.      Do you think that seeing an offensive item makes an area all the less attractive and good intended? What if something you liked ,was of an offence to another , does that make it all the more wrong for you to like it? Almost all the things and materials in this world are liked and disliked all based upon opinions. Nothing in this world exists without opinions. Life in itself can be an opinion.      I believe that if there is something in a library that is deemed offensive by one,it is not deemed offensive by all. Nothing should be removed from a shelf or a rack because another doesn't agree with it. Substitute other objects or ideas with this, if one person in the world was offended by another person would you just remove them from the human race? No, I sure hope you would not, but to some they @MONTH1 see that as their one resolution. Well me, I do not, and I'm a strong willed, strong opinionated person and to me that is all wrong.      Anything published or released to the world, to the public by someone means that is their way of expressing something, it is their way of living, and they have that right. That is who they are, and that is what they like,that is another person , anything we see or hear in this world is someone else because that has come from an individual who is equal to us,so why lessen there equivalence because its not the same way I feel? We @MONTH1 not all agree with their way of life, we @MONTH1 not agree with their choice of clothes, but how are we to know if we agree with their way of heart? No characteristic dictates the other characteristics of another,so why should an item?      A good thing to you could be a bad thing to another, and what if that disappeared? Taking a cd off a shelf will not vanish it from the world, it could be found somewhere else, but still that is like eliminating your hand because your fingers don't look like mine. Nothing can justify removing things from the stores and the world because one group of people don't understand it enough to feel the same and agree with it. Anything could be deemed inappropriate,but what if your vision of appropriate is anothers eye to inappropriate. Maybe there just is no line of the definition inappropriate,especially in the world we live in today.     If we start eliminating and removing everything we don't like, we would have nothing left, any and everything could be gone within a week or a month. People would take an inch to a mile , and erase everything, then we would start eliminating people we do not like , and it would all become a repeat. We learn about our history for a reason, does any of this resemble a situation or two the world has already been through? Erasing things from lives,have done no good before. If we start listening to the facts of people not agreeing with one thing, we will listen to the next, what happens when all the sudden the people come in again and say they do not like the women with blonde hair or the men with green eyes? The world will crash and burn before our eyes, and if I can identify these things at the age of fifteen, then some need to identify things at the age of fifty, accept that the world has its flaws too.      So just because I agree with everything I said , are you going to agree with it also? No I know you will not,but think about that when you expect others to agree with what you say or think. When I think of people reducing the things that they do not like, I can already see the world losing it's pathetic value it has earned, and we @MONTH1 not all be fond of this world but we cannot lose it. Eliminating the things you do not have a fatuation with will do no good, so maybe we should take into acceptance the different people we've been blessed with and love what we have. Accept the world as it is,because it is what you live in and it is what you have,because with out it nothing would be anything.Attempt to fix the broken things not eliminate the jagged things",4,4
2986,"The idea of the removal of 'offensive' material from libraries is understandable. Some believe that this material is not appropriate for anyone to view. However, because we all have different opinions on what is offensive, I believe that books found to be offensive should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      First, I believe that if this policy were to be in effect in libraries, there would not be many books left on the shelf. Offensive is a relative word. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another. Every has a different opinion on different matters based on their beliefs and life experiences. Many books have things people disagree with, but expressing this is a part of freedom of speech. Therefore, if everyone complained that they found a certain book or movie to be offensive, there would hardly be anything left, as Katherine Paterson said.      The purpose of a library is to provide the people who go to the library a resource. If the sources were censored in such a way, it would be hard to get information. Sometimes, it is beneficial, even, to read an opposing view or side to have more knowledge on a certain topic and see things from a different perspective.      However, some books @MONTH1 not be entirely appropriate to certain people. For example, some material in the library @MONTH1 not be best for small children to read or view. In this case, I do not necessarily feel that they should be removed from the shelves rather than placed in an area these children do not have access to.     Having books, music, movies, or magazines removed from the shelves if they are found to be offensive is in my opinion, a ridiculous notion. It hinders expression. People have different opinions about what is offensive to them and it would be very boring if everyone thought the same. If someone finds something particularly offensive, I believe they just should not view it",4,5
3530,"Have you ever wondered why a movie you rented from a library when you were younger, isn't there today? This is due to censorship. Libraries censor certain books if they believe them to be inappropriate for young children. Should censorship be allowed in libraries? Everyone has their own opinion, as do I, and I believe it should be allowed.     Censoring books allows libraries to withhold books, movies, magazines, music, and more from children who are not quite mature enough to handle the contents within the material, rather it be curse words in a movie, book, or music, nudity shown in magazines, or fighting shown in a video game. Young children look for role models, someone to follow, therefore, more than likely they are going to repeat what they hear or see. Some children are not quite mature enough to understand that it's not alway 'okay' to repeat what you hear, some words are inapporopriate for young children. Maybe they saw that on a movie, a man or woman solved a problem he or she had by fighting, the young child @MONTH1 take the message the wrong way, and try and solve one of his or her problem by fighting.      I believe that an age limit should be set for certain types of materials. Children that are under the age of @NUM1 should not be watching movies that are rated @CAPS1-@NUM1. There is a reason the rating is what it is. Just because your child is not allowed to rent/check out whatever the material @MONTH1 be, doesn't mean that you couldn't check it out, maybe go home and watch/listen/read/play it. If it doesn't seem to violent/graphic for your child then allow them to watch the movie, read the book, or play the game. That is your choice, but a library doesn't want to be blamed for your @NUM3 year old coming home cursing and fighting. My sister took my neice to the library once to rent a movie, it was a childrens movie, and my sister thought nothing harmful would come about it, but in one of the scenes, there was some arguing and fighting, and my neice began arguing with my sister, and hitting her, and my sister wasn't very pleased that they allowed that movie to be on the childrens floor of the library.          Censorship is a wonderful thing to have in libraries. Maturity level for some children is just not quite high enough for them to see/watch/listen/play certain materials. Not only should censorship be allowed, it should be enforced. I believe all libraries should have to have censorship in their library",4,4
3165,"Dear @CAPS1,      @CAPS2 name is @PERSON1. I am a student here at @LOCATION1, and it has come to @CAPS2 attention that the @ORGANIZATION1 is thinking about taking books they find offensive out of the library. I think this is wrong. If everybody at @LOCATION1 took the books we found offensive off the shelves and threw them away, we would be left with no books to read.      I also think that no one person should have the right to decide what books are too offensive for me to read. I am sixteen years old and responsible enough to make @CAPS2 own decisions about what is too offensive for me to be reading. If I feel I should read books that others @MONTH1 find offensive then, why does that concern you? Just because I want to read the book does not mean you have to.         Also, I think that having books that might be a little offensive makes that book more interesting. If you take every offensive word out of a book, chances are it is going to be hard to sit through it. If you take all offensive books from the library, kids will be even more discouraged about reading, and I know that is not what @LOCATION1 is looking to do.     If you think that books are that offensive, try walking down the hallways. this is a @ORGANIZATION1. Kids cuss all the time, and talk about dirtier stuff than in any book I've ever read. If your looking to make children more innocent, then taking all ofour books out of the library is not the way to go about it",4,4
3613,"Cennsorship in Libraries       To remove something a person dislikes off of a shelf, is assuming other peoples opinions don't count. It really has to depend on what the product is. Such as a book, magazine, music album, or a movie. Usually in any store i've walked into, there are certain departments for each product. In these seperate departments, the product is always catagorized. Not from what people like, but by genera or age differences. If a person was to linger away from their section in that department and go to another part, their taste in their product will seem too different to like.      A local library in a persons commuinty will have many books to read and to choose from. There are baby books, kids sections, teenage and adults sections as well. The teenage section is for me! Although I used to always be in the kids section not that long ago, those books should now be removed because I have no use for them or wouldn't be interested in picking another one up. Yet that is just me. However the generation under me will soon love them. Just because one person dislikes something, doesn't mean it should be thrown out for everyone else.     Music is a different story. Some people like country and some people like alternative. In libraries they have all types of music albums that a person can listen to, before they rent it out. When I listen to one album to see if I like it and find out that I don't, I simply put it back on the shelf and try another one. The librarian doesn't throw it away because of my opinion, because to someone else it would be the sweetest music to their ears.      Anyone can watch any type of movie in my opinion. Yet not all parents allow their twelve year old to watch a rated @CAPS1 movie. For them, it's only @NUM1 movies. This is how I grew up. Now that I am allowed to watch whatever my heart desires, i've noticed that movies are based on maturity levels. In libraries, some movies arn't allowed to be rented by a younger person. Yet it doesn't mean they should be tossed out. When they are older they might actually like them.     Overall a persons opinion will be the most important one to them. Other opinions wont matter. Products in a library are for anyone to view, not to judge. If absolutly everyone did judge the products, there wouldn't be any left",4,4
4316,"I do not think people should take books off the shelves because the town libraries have those types of books. People should enjoy reading all types of books. Some people only read different books. Little kids like fantasy and picture books, teenagers like romance, and others like nonfiction. It should not matter what other people think.     If people brought books off the shelves then what will the other people read. Before you bring books off the shelves, you should ask and write down what other people like instead of doing what you think is right. Think about what would happen if u brought down books off the shelves. What would happen? I will tell you, you would lose customers.     If you don't want children to read inappropriate books, then you should make a card saying that your parents give them permition to read those books. If that won't work, then make an age limit. Have the parents show you their berth certificate. Have a resticted section in the library. In order to get a book from the resticted section, then have a parent sign a note saying that their allowed.     Children the age of thirteen and under should not be given magazines. If their the age of fourteen and up, then they can get a magazine. Music should not matter to parents, so there should be no problem there. If the movies are bought by the parents, then there should be no problem there either. The other things you can figure it out on your own.     This is what I think should happen to books in a library. I told you how a library should work. I told you what I thought should go on in the library. I will give you some advise. Think before you do. That is all I am going to tell you.",3,3
4681,"I personally do not think that books or magazines and such with offensive things about them shouldn't be removed because they give people something to read. Most people don't want to read @CAPS1 or a novel. Some people want to read about crimes, mysterys, and action. There are alot of good movies out there but some of them I can agree with are too offensive to others. I gurantee that movies with comedy in them will be put down about what is being said. For example: @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to some people is very offensive. The only reason the person would think that the movie is offensive is because they are stubborn people that don't have a life.     I can believe that there are literature materials that are offensive to others, but the person that criticizes others doesn't think that they are offensive to the people that read the books that offened the person that is being offended. Books about war to some people are too graffic. But those books about war are probably books about history. I have only started noticing the people that are trying to get rid of those books that they don't like. But back in the @DATE1's people didn't care about what was in a library. They just want something to read. I say leave the librarys alone!",3,3
3089,"We've all heard the songs on the radio that are censored by constant beeps because of bad words, and we've all seen  @ORGANIZATION1 shows and movies that are the same way.  Books and magazines are censored the same way by either blocking out the offensive language or replacing the letters with astrics.  Numerous amounts of people see no harm in this and support it, while others think that it is no big deal because, eventually, people are going to end up seeing the bad things anyway.      If you were an author, musician, or director, wouldn't you want your work to be seen and published as you had originally written it?  Most of those people would, and get angry when their work is edited.  They want their work to be heard, and sometimes editing out the disrespectful things cause the message not to be understood as clear as it would be with those certain words.  This can also cause the original message to be completely missed, and the work could end up meaning something totally different then what it was originally supposed to mean.      However, another question arises: If you were a parent, would you want your kids to see those inappropriate scenes in movies, or hear harsh words in music?  Most would not want that at all and strongly encourage editing out things that their children are too young to hear and understand.  Eventually, though, kids are going to be faced with those things.      In conclusion, cenorship should just be ignored.  Children are going to end up hearing bad words, seeing inappropriate things, and reading offensive passages in books or magazines.  Censoring things can mess up the original message being brought to attention and anger many authors and musicians.  There are loads of harsh things in the world, its impossible to just edit them all out",3,3
4643,"I am sending this letter to you about my views on censorship in libraries. Some people think books, music, movies, magazines,etc., are offensive. Those things might be offensive to them, but not to other people. So you have to look at it in not only your point of view but other people point of view.          I think they should not remove these things from the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view like my mom for instence she likes vampire books and movies, but i like tragedy. See everyone likes something different. They also have to think to the books we have from @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM2, etc., are offensive to some people. Are we going to take those books out to.          I mean if we took books, music, movies, magazines, etc., out for being offensive then we would not have any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Everyone thinks something offensive, some might think the same thing is offensive some might thing something different is offenseive. We should not take books, music, movies, magazines, etc., off the shevles.     I understand that people do not want there kids to see them or hear them. It part of life though. You can not take everything out to please one person, because it could make another person mad",3,3
3140,"I think that removing books from a library that are offensive shouldn't be allowed, first off because people have different taste on the books they read. I also think that the books that the libary carries are educational, they might be offensive to people but sometimes they are good for learning new things about the world around us. Another thing is that a lot of books, movies, music, and magazines might be offensive to you, but if you dont want your child to read those then just keep them away from those types of books at the library, and the people that do want to look at that stuff can. So i think it just depends on what kind of stuff people like, everyone likes something different.      One reason why i think that libraries shouldn't be censored is because some people have different taste in the books they read. Some people like scary books, some people like romantic, so  everyone doesnt all like the same thing. Everyone might be offended of something but people should't let it bother them.      My second reason is because books that they carry at the library are usually educational. They have learner books for the little kids to help them learn how to read, they have magazines for the people that are interested in the drama around the world, then we have war books for the people that are interested in history, so i dont think that people should really be to offended by the books that people read.      Another reason is that if you dont want your child or a looking at the books or ect. That might look offensive to you then dont let them read them, everyone likes different things, and if you take away things that other people like then your just offendending them too. Thats why people that enjoy to go to the library should't take things so offensive, so we don't have to censor things at the library.     So thats why i think that libraries shouldn't have to be censored at all because people have different taste in the books that they read, that books that libraries carry are usually educational, and if you don't want your child looking at those kind of books then don't let them read them. People need to undrstand that some books aren't always trying to offend people, but the ones that are they are just trying to state there own optinon",4,4

3171,"Our founding fathers creating amendments for the people.  One of the greatest is the freedom of speech.  Censorship of offessive materials is unnecessary.  Books, music, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 have bad messages or nudity, but that does not give anyone the right to get rid of them.  Book burning happened because of the dislike of people's writing.  People have the right to say how they feel by any medium.  Censorship of anything makes a child more immature.     Book burning is a horrible action by any person.  People used to burn them because of all the sex, drugs, and violence, but doing this destroys people's dreams, theories, and ideas.  In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, firemen would burn any book seen within a home.  Almost ever single book in the world is not factual, unless it is nonfiction.  The firemen in the novel destroyed any bits of type because it was false and went against the government.  That basically means every kind of book out there.  The causation of such a tragedy was that every citizen befriended their television or video games.  Without books there would be no real sort of entertainment.  Also, the things we read everyday are what make us who we are so there, in fact, should not be less books but more.     Libraries have no right to censor books.  Freedom of speech has been around almost since the beginning of this nation.  Why should it change now?  Stopping obscene literature from being in the reach of the people is stopping writers from speaking out.  They @MONTH1 have already written their ideas, but if nobody reads their work then there is no way that they'll be heard.  Libraries are not there to stop things from reaching little kids' ears but to provide any knowledge a man needs.     Parents have always stopped their precious babies from watching certain shows and movies.  I once knew a woman who would never allow her son to watch the @PERSON1 series because of the use of sorcery.  She believed that he would try to learn witchcraft.  I found that quite ridiculous when I heard about it.  When a kid watches murder mysteries, fantasy shows, or dramas with bits of nudity, it is different to them and they are curious.  After watching these kind of scenes, a parent needs to sit down with their child and talk about what they jus saw.  The child needs to know that killing is wrong and justice is good and magic and dragons don't exist.  Nudity has always been considered a bad thing but penises and boobs are part of the human body.  Kids will be more mature about it the more they see it, but that doesn't the child should watch porn.     Censory has always been taken the wrong way.  People believe if that the offensive material is shown then the watcher or reader will have bad thoughts about what they learned about.  We should not get rid of the obscenity at all.  We should have an understanding of the bad things in life.  Burning books is a bad way to destroy the foundations of the human mind.  Freedom of speech is a law and should be followed.  Censorship is not always a good thing for children or anyone for that matter",5,4
3340,"There are many books, movies, and music in the libraries. These things can come in so many varities. Have you ever been to a library and not found something you liked? Well most people find a  lot of things that intrest them in many ways. Many people come to a library a day to check out something they will enjoy and have a good time listing, reading, or watching. So many people are diferent and each person likes something diferent from one another. So the question is, 'Should we remove some books, music, and movies off the shelfs because they're offensive?'     From experince, yes there are things at a library that children or younger teenagers should not read, hear, or see. Though that most libraries split a lot of there sections up by ages. Depending on your age you should go to the sections that mostly provides the thing you want. Do not go to a place that provides something that is not your age group, instead go to the place that looks like you belong.  I personally have seen younger teens or children get a book or magaizine that was not there age group, but @CAPS1 that children wanted to look up on that thing. You have to understand that most younger teens and children are curious about many things before they even get to that age.     As a  parent or legal gardian, most children look up to you. @CAPS1 you read, listin, or watch something that is not to there age level, but the child wants to be just like you. Children look up to there parents or legal gardian. They want to @CAPS1 do the same thing you do, so they copy you. They will find soemthing that is similar to what you doing. They might go find a book, movie, or cd that is not there age group. They will do this all because @CAPS1 they want to be just like there parents or gardian. So as a parent or gardian you have to watch what you do also and try to set good examples to you children so they do not find offensive books or ect..           There are so many reason why people might think some things are offensive. Even though we are the reason why books and other things are brought into libraries today. Children today are growing up a lot faster then we want them to, but sometimes we can not stop that. Just set good examples to children or any person not to get a book, movie, or music that is not there age group. Libraries can be a fun and learning enviroment for everyone. Just sometimes we all do not think a like or like the same stuff.     There are just to many people in this world and I have read articles about libraries. I have read why libraries might not be a family place anymore all because of the varities they carry. Have you ever thought though, '@CAPS1 its use humans that makes the libraries carry these varities?' I think so, because we are what makes up a library. We the people are the ones that want these books, movies, magazines, and music. So think about it next time you walk into a library and you see something that you @CAPS1 not think is right. Think about how @CAPS1 someone @CAPS1 really likes that. We all need to except things if we like it or not at times. Just set good examples to help people not get those things that could be offensive",4,3
4410,"I belive that all literature of any kind is useful even though it could be offensive.  If society plans on taking something off the shelf because it offends a race or gender, than many life-lesson books, movies, magazines, music, etc., would be removed from the shelves.  Things such as books or movies are there to take people to different worlds, to help them learn knowledge, to teach them lessons that the real world @MONTH1 not teach them.  If materials are taken off the shelf in fear of offending someone, then not very many things will be left just like Katherine Paterson says in her quote.  If certian literature were not around anymore then it definitly would not be the same as it is now.  Literature are there for us, they teach us, and if if one @CAPS1 was taken away, it would start a riot.     Books are always there for us, when we are bored, lonely, or just want to escape reality.  Imagine if you we not able to read your favorite book because it was no longer considered appropriate for society.  If all books had to be appropriate for every age, it would take all the interesting out of everything.  Whether it is a novel or a regular encyclopedia, all books would be dulled down to exceed the needs of our 'non offending' society.  Lots of music would lose it's luster and magazines would not be able to gossip about the 'hottest new things.'  Movies would get too boring to watch and many things in society would fall apart.     Books, documentaries, magazines, are there to help people learn, either if its a lesson about what not to do while your young, such as smoking, if books about smoking were taken away because it offended the part of society that chose to smoke then how would any of the teens today know not to start smoking?  Novels are usually fiction, but the characters come to life to readers.  They have problems just life people of the real world even though they @MONTH1 not be real themsleves, so if one reads that book, the way that character handles the situation could help a real life person decide on what they should do about there problem.  Important history books of movies could be taken away becaus it 'offends' @CAPS2 @CAPS3 to have students learn about slaves.     If one @CAPS1 was taken from the shelf because of offending someone then more and more materials would be taken away form society.  What good does that do anyone?  It leaves many students uneducated about many things that they need to be educated about.  It would disrupt the order in libraries if books were being removed because of aproppriateness.  If books were being judged on appropriateness then many authors would not be able to write the novels and literature that they do now.  No good would come of removing anything from the shelves of libraries.     Books, movies, magazines, music, it is all too important to society, it keep us company, it teaches us, is makes life easier at times when the world wants to kick you while you are down.  If one person decided that a book was not appropriate then they can chose not to read it, but they should not decide to help remove that book from the shelves of libraries.  They would start a landslide of trouble that would effect everyone in the @LOCATION1 and maybe even across the globe.  Information of any kind is a good @CAPS1 no matter the content of it.  So removing any sort of material from our libraries is a horrible idea.",4,4
2995,"Do you think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines shout be removed from shelves because someone finds them offensive? Such as magazines, books, movies, and even music. I simply do not find any of it right that few peoples opinion's should matter depending on what they find offensive for two reasons. Those reasons being that you picked it out yourself and that you have traveled to the library looking for something you will enjoy.     The first reason I think that certain books, music, movies and magazines should not be removed form the shelves are because people have picked them out there selves. Noone is ever going to pick up a book or magazine or even watch movies and listen to music that looks, seems, or even sounds offensive. Mainly because alot of people don't take being ofeneded to kindly. For example, why would a person buy an object that does not seem appealing to them?     The second reason that I think that certain books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves are because if your going to the library your looking for an interesting book, type of music, a movie, or a magazine. Most likely you're going to end up getting one that looks intersting to you and something that you feel fits your taste. So if there is a book, some sort of music, a movie, or a magazine and it looks offensive then don't get it because if somethings going to offend you its going to be pretty obvious due to what it looks like, seems like, or even sounds like.     In my opinion I think that if certain books, music, movies, and magazines are offensive to some people that they should not be taken off the shelf. If you picked something out at the library or went to the library looking for something that you would enjoy, you will obviously end up knowing if something looks, seems, or even sounds offensive",3,3
3680,"I will be talking about, do think books, music, or even magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive. In my opinion I don't think books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive too some people. Because not all people have the same interests.     First of all I think things shouldn't be removed from library shelves because people don't like the items because they get offended. But the people who like the item say like an explicit @CAPS1 they would probably buy it. But also the people who don't the explicit @CAPS2 would get offended and would want it off the shelves.     Another example can be a book. what if a person didn't like what he/she read and gets offended. They would return the book and would not want to sell anymore and wouldn't mention it to a friend. But another person comes along and picks the same book and did like what he/she did read and that person would probably recommend it to a friend.     The same way goes for a magazine also. What if a person gets offended at an advertizement. A person likes it and returns it, then comes along another person who gets offended at it and doesn't like it it shouldn't stop selling for that particcular person.     In conclusion I think things in the library shouldn't stop selling because one person gets offended at it. they shouldn've look at the item in first place.",3,3
3954,"I don't think censorship should be practiced in libraries, @CAPS7 it's not fair to everybody. If censorship was practiced everywhere, there probably would not be any movies or anything entertaining out, due to a large amount of people complaining. I have a few reasons also @CAPS6 I think there should not be censorship in libraries.     @CAPS5 first reason is freedom of the press. In our @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right of writing what we want, and if censorship continues, we will lose one of our rights. I don't think that's fair to control what we want to write or read.     Another reason I have would be freedom of speech. Also written in our @ORGANIZATION1 of @ORGANIZATION1, we are given the right to say what we want, and nobody can control that. If we keep using censorship, then this right will also be taken away from us. We're slowly losing our @CAPS1 given rights, @CAPS7 people are offended by books and things of that nature.     A personal experience I have was one day @CAPS5 friend and I were going to go to the library to get a book for our history report. The report had to be over the @DATE1's and slavery. Unfortunately, @CAPS5 friend was @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and he had a hard time not being offended by the assignment. When we got to the library, things got worse. All of the books we found were over how bad the slaves were treated back then.     @CAPS5 friend was getting very upset at this point. Finally, he saw another book making fun of the slaves, then he went up to the librarian asking, '@CAPS4 you take those books off the shelf and put them somewhere else?' The librarian just looked at him with a straight face and said, 'No. What makes you think you should get any special treatment?' @CAPS5 friend was dumbfounded. He couldn't believe what he had just heard.     After he had came back over to where I was sitting, I had told him that she was right. '@CAPS6's that?', he said. I said, '@CAPS7 if she would've taken all those books down, she would've had to take about every other book down too, @CAPS7 somebody would find something hurtful.' 'You know, your probably right,' he said.     Censorship isn't fair, @CAPS7 it limits us to our abilities and what we enjoy. It's not fair to punish other people based on what they read, write, or say. We all have our own preferences; how would you like it if yours got taken away?",4,4
3369,"All kid's have their own style of books, @CAPS1 people like scary, funny, or romance books, but can we really take that to an offense? We should think of how taking @CAPS1 books off the shelf would affect more then one person, @CAPS1 people @MONTH1 be mature enough to read the more 'grown up' books or magazines, libraries have all types of syles for different people, you just might have to look a little harder to find the right book for you.         I do not agree that @CAPS1 books and or magazines can be taken offensive. All libraries are different  types of books,for example  an elemantry school library they will not have grown up or teenager books, and a middle school will not have little kid books. We also have to think does peer presure effect what books or magaiznes kids read? , for example when I was in middle school my friends were all reading romance books, and I was still reading @ORGANIZATION1, and I had to change my reading style to fit in, so that's exactly what I did.      Books that have offensive content shouldn't be taken off the shelf, I believe that if there is 'offensive' books in your library, just ignore them you @CAPS2't have to get that book, we cant just take the more grown up books out because @CAPS1 kids @CAPS2't know what their suppose to be reading. Libraries have all different style of books to fit everyone's taste, so just look for that right book that suites you, and @CAPS2't take all the books that have an offensive style of the shelf, @CAPS2't judge a book by it's cover",3,3
3972,"Libraries are full of all different sorts of books, movies and magazines.  These books, movies, and magazines @MONTH1 come across as offensive to some people. Parents might not want their children to see certain books or movies. Does this mean we should take thoughs offensive books off the shelf?      If everyone decided to take one book or movie they think was inappropriate off the shelf, there would be nothing left in the library. Books contain adventures and life lessons that kids and adults need. Young Children need books to help their imagination grow.  If there was not anymore books in the library, children would not be able to learn or grow. Movies are just like books but for young children it is easier to visualize a movie rather then a book. If the book or movie is found offensive to you, pick another, but it should not be removed from the shelf.  One book or movie @MONTH1 seem offensive to you, but @MONTH1 not to another person.     A world without books. No imagination. No adventures. It would be a boring world.  I would rather have a few offensive books then none at all. That way I can learn and see character's adventures through my own eyes",4,4
3465,"In my own personal opinion this letter to the newspaper with my views on censorship in libraries is that I think music, books, magizines, and etc should be stayed on the shelves. If they can get illistrated they should be able to be read or listened to.      The things in this paragraph will be about the content of music,books, magizines, and etc. The music industry too many people think some songs are innapropriate but really that ruins the whole point of the whole entire song. Maybe it could be age adviced but thats all they should do they should not cut down the content. The magizines should be read or looked at by anyone because they are illistrated books. They should be aloud anywere if they got illistrated. Movies should be put in the library with age advice because someone had to allow that movie to go out in theatres, @CAPS1, or on the @CAPS2.      From my experience I have seen people complain about these things. I really do not get why you should complain about these things. Now you decide what your views are on censorship in libraries",3,3

If this is a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 library no, but if it is a @ORGANIZATION1 library, yes. I am going to tell you what I think about the books, movies and magazines.          First I'm going to tell you about the books. I think the books in a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 should not be censored because parts of history get kind of gross and nasty. Then also sex ed books need to be in the library so people can read about it and not just go with what other people say. I don't think they should matter if its a nasty love book or a @CAPS2 @PERSON2 book, all that matter is that they are reading. War books should not be censored because they need to let the reader know how war really is and its not a great place to be. Now in a @ORGANIZATION1 library yes because no parent would want their eight year old daughter reading about how to make drugs. I think they could put stuff in there about drug or alcohol perhaps but not go in depth, but keep it at a bare minimum.           Next  I'll talk about the movies they should have avalible in the library. I don't think anything over @NUM3 at a @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level. Exept like sex ed tapes and history movies, no free days in class, its got to be @NUM3. In @ORGANIZATION1 I it should be @CAPS3-@CAPS4 movies. In those grade they really dont watch educational films it's all for fun films, so theres no reson for there to be anything worse than @CAPS3-@CAPS4.          Last I'm going to tell you about magazines. In @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 I don't think the magazines are a big issue. Just as long as theres not @CAPS7 and stuff like that. At the @ORGANIZATION1 leave again I think they should be, kids that age shouldn't be reading @ORGANIZATION2. They just need to have learning and for fun magazines.          Should there be censorship in libraries? No at the @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 level and yes at the @ORGANIZATION1 level. @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 leave the book shouldn't @ORGANIZATION1 they should, should in both @ORGANIZATION1 movies, and magazines shouldn't in @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 and should in @ORGANIZATION1.",3,3

There are certaint things for people for certaint ages to look at, there kids sections there is a teen section and there is an adult section. there could be some stuff that people will think is offensive. but that doesnt mean they would have to take @CAPS4 off the shelf they @CAPS1 @CAPS2 have to grab @CAPS4. simple as that.     and thats all there is to @CAPS4..and thats what i think about library products like that. and what people should do to not getting stuff that is offensive to them...'@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4'!",2,2

3487,"Everything is offensive to someone. There is no way to make sure nobody is offended unless you have nothing to offend anybody at all. If there is something on the shelf, someone can find something offensive in it. here is a good senario; there is a childrens book. It is one of the gratest books ever written, but it was written before the civil war and there is a racist comment in it. @CAPS1 good bye to that book. Some people would probably think '@CAPS1 its only a childrens book. I'm sure we will survive.' @CAPS1 lets move on to a bigger idea. What happens when someone says the bible is offensive. @CAPS1 thats gone, but now its supports are saying the other people's entire religion is offensive. Thats a couple more books. Now we have violence.      Moderate censorship is acceptable for the young, but there is a line, even though it is hard to find sometimes. Obsence images that are illegal to view by a minor are acceptable but those that are legal should be seen without censorship. Censorship for those who understand is unacceptable, although select items should be viewed under supervision. To strip the rights of a person is not acceptable.      The @LOCATION1 government has given people freedoms. One of those freedoms is the freedom of speech. This basically means i can say what ever i want and support whatever i want. A book is a form of speech. Although some speech is looked down upon, it should not be censored. Censorship is just basically saying; 'you can not say this.' That moves on to; 'you can not say.' then; 'you have no say.'     In developing countries, such as congo, if you go to the goverment and say what they are doing wrong and that you are agianst them, take a guess at what happens. They shoot you. A better word for that would be they censor you. If you write a book saying how obama could be a better president, but someone finds it offensive, what happens. They censor you. Now you get no say in the matter because the supporters of obama dont want you to. Do you see much difference?     Supervisation is a powerful thing. Guess what it can do better then censorship. With a supervison, children can still learn about topics but are not simply thrown into the obscene areas of it. A person is a human being. That includes children. The have a right to learn without the influence of others, but censorship denies them of that right.      Censorship should not be used in libraries. It takes away freedoms and oppertunities for children. It causes violence among people. It scars culture, and ignores religion. Although censorship has the ability to do more damage then any single person, it is not 'bad'. Censorship was created to protect people from things that they feel to be wrong. But good intentions do not keep wrong consequenses at bay.",4,4
3977,"I do not believe there should be censorship in our libraries. By censoring our libraries, they're censoring us. This is supposed to be a democracy, not a dictatorship.     A good example of censorship that has recently happened is rewriting all the @PERSON1 books just because they use the 'n word' and some people find this offensive. The thing is, this is how they talked back then, this is just the way things were. People can't just rewrite books because they don't like the history behind them. They can change all they want, but in the end it still happened. We recite history so we don't make the same mistakes again, and this is a good example of it.     Music shouldn't be censored. Music is a form of expression, and by censoring the music, you're censoring the artist. They say the things they do for a reason and they work hard to create the things they do. We're supposed to have freedom of speech, so now why are we getting these freedoms taken away from us just because a select few deem it inappropriate. We don't make anyone listen to anything they don't want to. Each generation has it's own style and music, has it's own problems and ways to deal with them; our generation is music, so let us express ourselves.     Movies are censored due to language and content, which I get, but actually removing them from our libraries should not happen. If the audience is mature enough to handle it, they should be able to watch it. We don't need to take out curse words or remove inappropriate scenes just so childern can watch them. If they are really that bad, they don't need to watch them period until they are mature enough to handle it.     Magazines should be censored in the same way as movies, by maturity level and age. I agree there are some movies that are inappropriate, but taking out articles just because someone in charge doesn't like what's being said is wrong. We can't just block out all the bad things that are happening in the world and just pretend nothing's wrong because the stories aren't being told. People deserve to know what's going on. People deserve to read, watch, or listen to anything that they want. By censoring things, they're only going to make us search to find them, therefor making it kind of like a reward to get to see the things others find so inappropriate that they're willing to go out of their way to get rid of them.     You can't please everyone, so just elt us make our own decisions. Censoring our libraries is like censoring us. We have our constitution, we know our rights, now why are people nowadays thinking they can change them? They can't keep us dumb by hiding things. We're still going to find them, they're just going to make it like a game of tag; so let the game begin",4,4
4771,"We all hope that one day our children will not pick up a book or a magazine their not suppose to read. Children don't know any better. But why should we have to have movies, books and etc censored, cause their little children every where. If i had the right to keep the books and etc on the shelf i would.      I think that we should be able to have books that are uncensored on the shelfs. If everything was censored we would really have nothing to read or to watch. Having everything censored thats just not fair to the world. Everyone should be able to watch what ever they want with out it having to be censored. If people favorite movies or music was censored it probably wouldnt be that funny to them anymore, they'll most likely just stop watching it.     I don't believe that they should have a censorship in libraries. Certain materials in like cd's songs do come off little offensive sometimes, but that's just life. If you think it's offensive then just don't listen to it. That doesnt mean that they have to take it off the shelf. Maybe other people like that kind of music or etc. That doesnt mean they have a right just to take it off cause of that. If they did that's just really unfair.     Children now days see more and know more what they are not suppose to know, for an example cursing. If a child happen to see cursing in a magazine at the library and their parents got mad that was in the magazine. The parent shouldnt really be mad and take that offensive, and think that not suppose to be in their. The library shouldn't have to censor thing's cause of that incident. The children will hear it or see it again soon or later.      I would keep the right for the libraires to have things uncensored, if i had the decision. Those are some ideas why i think they shouldnt have to censor movies, music etc in the library.",4,4
3543,"In Katherine Paterson's writing she tells us that she does not want her child to pick up a book off the shelf that could be found offensive. But I think that there should be sections of the library that are cut off away from the public eye, but are still there for those certin people.     If my child were to pick up a book that was not for his/or her age group I would not get made, because I know that some of the book groups are close to others them some, but they are for everyone to see, which could be offensive to some. I would tell my son/ or daughter that that book is not for you, and we would go and pick out a new book to read.     Over all I think that there should be sections of the library that are made for a certin age group, and should not be seen by kids. Because once I was that little kid, and went wondering through the miles of shelfs to find a really wonderful book to read, but long behold that didn't happen, I had wondered along to find a book that was not in my age group.     So I think that there needs to be more careful eyes in the library staff to make sure that those kind of things will never happen again.",3,3
4324,"I think that any book or movie should have some warning sighns apon it, to insure that all peaople know what they are going to experience before reading or seeing anything. sSome movies or books read or watched, should have an age limit too.

It would b hard taken stuff out of movies and music like that because it might take alot of what the people want to see.     In magazines alot of people including i like hearing the trooth about celebrities and interesting facts about people and movies, that alot of people @MONTH1 not know.

4632,"@CAPS1 happened to using books and films as simple entertainment? Why are we now cautious of @CAPS1 our children pick off the shelf? Society today has changed the way we once viewed our sources of entertainment. Books are now viewed with skepticism and once harmless movies and magazines are full of material no one should be reading or watching. Music used to be a beautiful form of art, but now when you turn on your radio, @CAPS1 do you hear? Mindless spewing of words linked together with curses and other garbage. Should libraries use caution when renting something to someone who shouldn't be using that material for harmless entertainment.     There once was a young girl, fourteen or fifteen, who loved to read and listen to music. She was bright but shy, and used books as her friends. Each day she walked to the library for a new story to dive in. One day she came across a book on the top shelf of the fiction section. The book looked used, for its spine was badly split and several of the pages were nearly detached. She reached for the book, intrigued, and flipped through the pages. Her innocent and naive mind caught a hold of a world she didn't know. After reading the book, she was filled with guilt. It wasn't a good book, but a book that was laced with a harmful message. This young girl, once pure and simple, now knew things no one at that age should know. So, why wasn't there a warning of some sort?     The difference between writing something offensive and being offensive is that the writer usually doesn't intend to be hurtful or rude. The author most likely intended for the peice of literature to be enjoyed with a clear and playful attitude. However the comparison between writing something offensive and being offensive is far different. When you read something in a book or magazine that disturbs you, put it down, or throw it away. No one is forcing you to read the material. Yet, the real question is; @CAPS1 about our children? How do we keep them safe from offensive literature? And @CAPS1 about music? Or movies?     Remember the old black and white films? How, no matter @CAPS1 the plot or storyline is, the two leading roles somehow fall in love in the end? The ending title fills the screen just before the two actors share a kiss and then the screen goes black. Mind, there are still movies with happy endings and a positive message. @CAPS1 about the other films? Some of the biggest blockbusters are those which have either violence, some form or racism, and/or sexual content. Personally going to the movies to see a new action movie that looks thrilling and entertaining should be fun, but where does the fun stop? After the guy in the first scene has just been brutally murdered? Or after the two lovers share a special bond that should be kept private? And @CAPS1 happens when this movie is released and checked out from the library by a young boy who just wants a fun sleepover with his friends? How do we keep these sorts of material away from them?     Libraries should use major caution when priting labels to place on their books, movies, magazines, etc. Librarians should make sure that the book a child hands to them is safe to read for that age level. Also, they should check the ratings on movies or make them not available to certain age group. Parents should also use caution when letting your child go to the movies with friends. Make sure they see something fun, but with a positive message.     Should libraries take certain material off their shelves? I don't think so. However, be careful @CAPS1 you read or watch, for it might not please you. Use the internet as a source to find reviews on books and magazines, so see how well it was rated and then decide whether it is an intriguing read or an amazing film. Have fun, but be careful",6,6
4437,"Libraries should censor some of the materials that they have available to the public. This is important because a child could easily gain access to the offensive material. Censorship is very important for libraries because we do not want our children getting influenced by offensive materials found in their libraries.           The libraries would not even have to get rid of the offensive materials that they took from the shelves. A good idea for them to do is to move all of them to an section for adults so the children will not be able to see them. The libraries would not be losing any money and they would be keeping the youth away from things that are not appropriate for them. Their is no reason to give people access to material that could be offensive to other people.           There are only a few reasons why I think that people should have access to offensive materials. Someone could need to use a book that has something offensive in it, but they would all be taken away to somewhere else. I think that it depends how offensive the materials are, as to whether or not they should be removed from the shelves.      Although I am sort of split on this issue, there are some very good reasons why to move the offensive materials away from the shelves. Those materials are not appropriate for the youth of our country, and they should not have access to them. We should censor the libraries so that nobody gets hurt",3,3
4185,"We live in a world @DATE1 inundated and persuaded by media.  Ever since we were little, our young minds have been filled with opinions of others from history and from the present.  Whether we are reading a book, watching a motion picture, or even listening to a new music artist, our lives are being affected by such media.     The art world is considered to be one of the most controversal businesses to work in.  Each piece of literature or movie is shared by a vast community of critics.  We all are given the right to our opinion on such  pieces.  Every piece of art is judged and then criticized.  However, many find certain pieces to be offending in some way, shape, or form.  It is quite impossible to produce such a piece that will fit everybody's satisfaction.  For an example, religious pieces are often scorned for their nonfactual information or for the director's or author's opinion over the matter.  Since we live in such a diverse community of religions, these pieces will never satisfy the audience.  Movies have been criticized for decades because they represent some sort of life lesson or truth that is not appealing to the audience.  Why not learn from them and reflect?     No piece of media can possibly be directed to satisfy the opinions of all the world.  As a personal example, I can see that novels and books over war are heavily criticized.  The men and women who fought for our country @MONTH1 enjoy to see such pieces written about them, but war protesters and peace keepers @MONTH1 see this as an insult to their cause.       @PERSON1 wrote a book by the name @CAPS1 @NUM1.  This book was heavily criticized over the topic of censorship.  The world in which they lived in had dramatically been affected by the impact of peoples opinions.  If a book or movie was offensive to a group of people, then they burned the books.  History books about slavery and war were burned because others found the topics offending.  Non-religious groups thought that religion was offensive, so they burned the @CAPS2 and other works of religion.  Their government wanted a world of peace and a community where every man was equal and diversity was no longer existent.      @PERSON1 denies the book was written over censorship but his book gives our generation a great lesson.  For generations, we have grown up in a world of diversity.  Every mind is special and different and will never share identical thoughts as his neighbor.  Therefore, we must recognize that we have to survive and live together.  We can not escape the diversity in which we live in.  The books we see on shelves, the movies we see on the big screen, and music we listen through our earphones all make up our generations history and the next.  We need to accept our neighbor and his opinions because we are all born equal.  If we throw away our history and our accomplishments, man is left nothing to improve on, nothing to leave his or her marking on history.  We have to accept others ideas and build on them to improve our life and other's.  As we stand @DATE1 in a world filled with diversity, we must move on and reflect.  It is not a time to offend and be offended but a time to learn and move on",4,4
3336,Their are some books that should not be removed from libraries do to censorship. From past exsperian with censorship I found out it can towne down a book. In the book @CAPS1 @NUM1 for exsample the books are being burnt and it is causing socity to fall apart. Censorship is from people with a more ethnich back ground that dont want the kids to grow up and see unappopreat langue.      The most recent book that I have heard of geting censored is @CAPS2 @CAPS3. The main word they are removing from this book is nigar because some people fined this word very ofinceve to their race. The comittys are trying to remove the books from school shelfs.     I think we should not have censorship just because parents do not want their kids to hear the words in school or read them when eventualy the kids will learn the words on their own or hear the words some were eles. The kids can even learn the word from their own parrent or from t.v. I personaly think that comittys should stop trying to censor every thing because they wont be able to sencer how adults talk when they are around chindren and younger adults,3,2
4533,"I believe that certain materials,such as books,movies,magazines,etc, should not be removed if they are offensive to others because censorship and libraries has their own rights to have what they want on their shilves.Yes you @MONTH1 say that some things are unapropriate for children to see but there is an children side of every libraryso that children would not have to see unapropriate things.I feel as thought that no one has the right to tell another store where to locate their things.       Also i can understand where the author is coming from but you would have to understand there is people oput there in the @LOCATION1 that would like to read or listen to unapropiate things that parent would not allow there children to see or listen to.I would also consider that @CAPS2, @CAPS1 dont let your child or children attend that library or that certain place where you know there is despictable materials there.Everyone has their own personal right to place there things where they want them to be.     There are many other options,@CAPS2 can order their books online or go to the library with their child.When I was a young girl my mom never let mee go anywhere along so i never had to worry about seeing anything unapropriate or affensive.Now a days in @DATE1 children know right from wrong.Children know what they suppose to read and does not.       I do also agree if a librarian or an adult see or hear children looking or listening to something i they know they should not be,They should stop the child or converscate them from the premises.         So No i do not agree with you.I still think that people should have the right to place there things where they want because it is their stuff and their property.",3,3
3278,"Everyone is different and unique in the world and they have their own unique opinions. Which brings us to the arguement of censorship on anything, because what some people find offensive others @MONTH1 not. The censorship that I am discussing  is specifically about censorship in libraries. There are three main reasons why libraries should not be censored. The first reason is the books were written so they could be viewed by the public. The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. The final reason is parents can limit what their own children read. The censorship of libraries is an absurd idea, because a few people shouldn't make the choice for everyone.     The first reason that libraries shouldn't be censored is the books were written so they would be read by the public. A library is a public place where people are supposed to get whatever books they choose. If a few people start censoring books then it will set off a chain reaction. After so many different books are censored there will be less books for peole to enjoy. All of the books that were censored were meant to be enjoyed. If books are censored some people @MONTH1 never even get a chance to see those books and they wont be able to learn from them. Books deserve the chance to be enjoyed like they were meant to be enjoyed and if they are censored that chance is gone.     The next reason is people have the right to make their own decisions. If someone doesn't like a book then they don't have to read it. They don't have the right to go censor that book, because they don't like it. Another person @MONTH1 enjoy that book and many others @MONTH1 like it as well. People should be able to choose what books they want and they shouldn't be told by others what they can and can't read. They need to let others make the decision when it comes to getting their books. People can't go around preventing other people from reading a book that they enjoyed. They need to let others think for themselves and let them read what they want to.     The last reason is parents can limit what their children read.If the parents don't want their children reading something then they can tell their children that they aren't allowed to read it. Other people shouldn't be able to censor a book, because it is innapropiate for children. The child's parents can protect them if they find the book offensive for their children. Everyone needs to worry about what they like and let the other people enjoy what they want to. Let the parents set the limit for their children and it makes life simpler. Also it allows everyone else to enjoy the books if they aren't censored just for children. Parents will worry about their children and adults can worry about themselves.     The censorship of libraries is absolutely wrong and it is also unjust. Somone shouldn't be able to say, 'I don't like this book so censor it.' I will remind you of the three reason why this is true. First the books were written so they would be enjoyed by the public.  Also people people have the right to choose what they want. Finally parents can set limits on what their own children read. Books should be left uncensored so they can be enjoyed by whoever wants to read them. Everyone needs to let books be enjoyed by all and they shouldn't take away a books cahnce to be loved by censoring it.",4,5
3352,"Yes because children should not be reading anything thats is like that. Children snhould be reading a book that haves good information in there and information the children should be learning while they are in class. Well if the books, music and other stuff to read and look have bad stuff in it should be removed from the shelf because children should not be looking at it. Some music has bad language in it and children should not be listening to music like that. Also movies that have inapproriate scenes in it should be watched by children becaus eits not good for the children to see all that and parents should do something about if their children is watching movies with inapprroiate scenes in it and magazines that have inapproiate pictures because children are too young to see that.",2,2
3692,"Have you ever seen a crazy person walking around saying odd or unique theories? Everybody is different and have their own opinion about what they think is right. It is alright to have different beleifs but that shouldnt mean people shouldnt seek to understand others. I beleive that the censorship in libraries is very important but that people need to seek to understand each other more, not be so stubborn, and look at different perspectives so that people can get along easier.     Many different materials are found in libraries and some of them are more censored than others. Many times the reason that the books or magazines are censored is because they portray strong ideas and theories. People have the right to speech so they should be able to show others what they beleive, but they need to make sure that showing what they know is not hurting anyone else. Explicit movies and music are very bad with seeking to understand. They are good because of the rating systems but still are very ignorant to others.     Many people just simply take the ideas of others the wrong way. People have trouble looking at things in different perspectives and because of it they can cause trouble. If people would seek to understand more, then the conflicts of different beleifs would not be as common. When people have different perspectives, they can be more knowledgable of various opionions.     Some people are just stubborn. They choose to only beleive their ideas and refuse to listen to anyone else's. Being stubborn is the opposite of seeking to understand. If people were less stubborn, they could see more perspectives and become more aware of how others felt. When people are stubborn, it can be very hard for others to deal with or for them to get along well with others.     In conlusion I do think censorship is important but I think that the reasons why we censor things are equally important as well. If people were more understanding of others, then we could have more censorship for the things that agrivate other people. We would also have less censorship for people who only try to spread there ideas. If people sought to understand, ;ooked for different perspectives, and were not so stubborn, then they would get along much better",4,4
3746,"In the current life we are all living we find a need to make things more an more private. If this something is said and we don't like it we find the urge to rid the @CAPS2 of to '@CAPS1' other people from it. In modern writing @DATE1 and all throughout history there have been certain books that we don't like because they go against what we find moraly right. But just because a group of people say it's wrong is there a need to completely abolish from the @LOCATION1?     No. When something is written it is written for a purpose. If there was no purpose then we wouldn't have anything to read at all in the first place. Yes, there are some books and magazine's that can be very vivid and unsutable for younger minds to experience. But that it is why these books are created for older people to read.      I am a large fan of books over the two @CAPS2 @CAPS3 that took place. I find them very fascinating and I love to see what my life could be like @DATE1 if the outcomes of those @CAPS3 would have been different. I will admit many of these books contain things that are very real in a sense that some adults even can't handle, but this would be no reason to get rid of them all together. These books signify a great part of human history that many people need to know. Without these books these @CAPS3 can become something in the past and nothing more.     There are also many books out there that have a large deal to do with very mature themes. These bookos can include very detailed areas about a sex scene. Yes indeed these books can definently be very unsutable for younger kids. But that is where the idea that these books were not created for them. They were created for older more mature readers. Also if we are so concerned as to what our children are seeing then that is where the parent would have to step in. The parent can control the limit in the intensity or maturity of the books their child is reading.     Looking out for what are children see is a large matter, the other side though is the thought of people getting ideas from reading more intense books. For instance when people find something that they truly believe in they can become very motivated to expand peoples knoledge of that matter. If one person reads a book about poloitics and see a side that they have never seen before they could become driven to form a group to drive that thought or matter into all of the minds of the human race. This could greatly affect us by having a large amount of people come to an uproar at a group even as large as our current governament. But even though this could happen what type of free, run by the people for the people, group are we now.     Overall putting restrictions on the things we read or see, to our country, would have to be moraly wrong. Limiting what are nation can see would lead to most likely more of an uproar than just having to deal with different thoughts or outlooks of a group of people. This could happen because people would see it as the government maybe making more socialist acts by trying to control our knoledge.",4,4
3000,"Hello, my name is @CAPS1, I feel that there should be any genre of media in libraries.  If they call it a 'media center,' then why censor any media.  People know to read the back of a book to see if they want it, so if they see something they don't like they are able to put it back on the shelf.  People say The @CAPS2 and the @CAPS3 inspired @CAPS4 @PERSON2 to kill @PERSON1, that is completly speculated it's all a matter of 'he said she said.'  I feel there should be sections for different sections for different age groups, but to censor literature is just un-@CAPS5.     There should be a parent supervising children @NUM1 and younger, because where it really comes to are the children and them not being exposed to something there not ready for.  There are some magazines and movies I feel shouldn't be in librarys, and those are as follows: pornography, non-educational movies, @CAPS6 @CAPS7, and social networks.     I'm not saying to let kids listen to murderous music and jump off of the terrace but, shouldn't some leeway on books.  This is an approved message thank you for your time, goodbye.",3,3
3980,People out there have the right to descide weather or not there childs books have censorship in it. Some parents dont want there child to read books like that till they get older. Kids in grade school dont know the book they are getting has profanity in it.           I think that in all grade schools and middle schools should have no books that have censorship in them. Yea some parents dont care what their child reads. Think about the ones that do. Not every one has the guts to say something to the school. If you ask me i would not but books with censorship in them in my childs school.     Then again the high school students are old enough to look threw the books and descide if they want to get that book or not. Yea some parents still care about their child when they get into high school but high school students are old enough to make their own descions. Some students @MONTH1 not relize what book they grabed untill they start reading but thats when they turn around and exchange it. I think high school students are smart enough to choose their own books.     This is why I think bout the books and magazines etc. with censorship should be removed from the grade schools and middle schools and not high schools. If you agree YOU can do something about it. Talk to your childs school,3,3
4617,"Everyone has found something offensive throughout their life. However, many people find different things offensive than others. There are many different topics that people are offended of whether it is race, religion,gender,etc.       If there is a book that you find offensive in a public library I do not think it should be removed. It is like removing something just because one person does not like it. That would not be fair to everyone else that goes to that library. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you but to another person it @MONTH1 not be. There are many reasons that book could be in the library. It could help someone write a paper, to learn about a subject, or do some research on a topic. If all the books, music, magazines,movies or any other item in a library was to be removed if one person found it offensive then there would hardly be any books at all left in the library.      I think all books should be kept in the library even if one person finds its offensive. It could be offensive to them but not to someone else. If one person finds a book offensive and another person doesn't then it is not fair to the one that isn't offened to not be able to check it out.      If the concern is if children check it out what they might be learning from it then that would be the parents fault for not supervising what their children are checking out. The child @MONTH1 learn something new from the book.      Even if it is offensive you could still learn something from the book, movie,magazine, music, etc. If you still read the book it could help you change your mind on the topic. It @MONTH1 help other people change their mind by bringing new opinions about the topic to their mind that they have never thought of.      One condition on why a book,movie,magazine,music,etc would be removed would be if everyone agreed on it. If everyone that came to that library was offended by it then it @MONTH1 be in the library's best interest to get rid of that book.      The main idea here is that all books that are in the library should stay in the library. The author wrote it for a reason and it should be open to those who want to read it. If one person does not like it then they should simply not check the item out. If that was what happened everytime someone found something offensive in a library there would be hardly anything to check out. Even if it is offensive to you it could come in handy for another person",4,4
3917,"You go to a library to read books, music, and magazines, but soon you find out that there are very offensive books. I strongly say yes, I agree that we should remove the books, magazines, and music from shelfs if they are offensive to people. We are suppost to feel safe reading books, listening to music, and reading magazines. When I was younger I went to the library all the time. I would get books to read and look at, and for a while I was excited to go to the library, but all the excitment went away after a few bad exsperiecnes. Remembering the names of the books are not going to come to me, but I know I was so upset by how the book was. It had words that I never heard before, and I got confused. This could happen to many little kids that come across a bad book, but really librarys should only have good books not bad.After that bad experience happened to me I ignored it like it will go away or something. Bad books, offensive books, should be taken off shelfs for good and never to return. I feel very strongly about this subject, because I am a book warm, I love to read books and being able to go to a library and find a good book thats not offinsive is all that I ask for in a library. Offensive books, music, and magazines should not be aloud to be in librarys at all. When kids read books or listen to music they want to be able to disappear in them, but if there are offensive stuff out there, how will they be able to do that. There are things that should be left out of libraries and that is offensive books, music, and magazines.In closing to my essay I still have full curage in my answer, I still say yes, they should remove the offensive books, music, and magazines. If it was your sister, your daughter, or your neciece that went into a library and found an offensive book, what would you say? I ask you this, how would you feel?",3,3
4752,"Censorship in libraries is when a librarian has the right to remove certain materials, such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., from the shelves of a library, if the item is inapropiate.  I believe that libraries should not have censorship.      I personally, think that it should be up to the library if they could have that power. If it is a library were there's always smaller children their, then I think they could have the power of censorship. In conclusion, it should be the parents of the smaller children's responsibility to make sure their child's book is appropiate for there son or daughter.     Now, say if it was just a normal library with both a mixture of both grown-ups and children, then I would say there still is no need at all for a censorship. First in for most, because its your choice of the item, if you think it is offensive then simply do not read it, watch it or listen to it.     Second of all, it wouldn't be fair to the people in the library who liked a certain item, but could no longer use that item just because one person thought it was offensive. Also people would just start saying they thought that item was not suited for the library just because they did not like it period.      Last of all, members of the library would have the same right as the librarians. So many of all the members have such different feelings on items, that so many different items would be taken off the shelf, that by the end there would be no books left.     In conclusion, personally I do not think censorship is necessary in libraries. It would not be needed because smaller children's parents should be responsible enough check the child's items, and also because there would be so much conflict with what items were taken of the shelf and how many items were taken off the shelf. There for, I believe cencorship is not need in libraries.",4,4
3616,"In this persuasive essay i'm going to write about why or why not offensive material should be banned from library shelfs, and there are a couple reasons that are going to help me do that. I think that we should'nt take anything off the shelfs in libraries.      My first main point why we should not take any material off the shelfs in libraries is that there are some material that people might find offensive that others do not and are getting affected by those who do want these material off the shelfs. I think that some of the movies and books that is taken off the shelfs should be material that some kids should experience that @MONTH1 help them in the future.     My second main point is that if we do take all of the offensive material off the shelfs there would only be movies and books like bambi and scooby-doo, because all the material that are in libraries are offensive to people in some ways different than others. I have not found a movie or book in any library yet that I have found offensive.      Also if we do, we might as well not even have a library, because there would only be about @NUM1 movies and books in the whole building, because of all of the offensive material that people could find in cd's, books, and movies.     People hear cuss words probably everyday, whether its at school or home. So all of the words and actions in movies are not as bad as people in real life saying them. I just think of every movie and book as just a movie and book. Scary movies are not real and some books too. There is sex and other inapropriate things in movies, but thats also why you have to be a certain age to even get the movies.      To summarize up what I was just talking about in the last couple paragraphs, I think that we should not take any thing off the shelfs in libraries, beacuse it will hurt others, and theres just no need in it",4,4
4382,"I am not in agreement because young children should not be exposed to certain offensive books.  However, I believe that books should not be removed or censored in the libraries. because they will separate be washig some bad things and they will be a bad idea",2,2
3325,"I think that a cencorship in libraries isn't needed. The grounds that are basing the cencorship are very opinionated and biased ones. Two readers of one book could view the material compleately differently.      The reader has chosen to read that book, and thus more than likely know what the general plot is before they read the first page because of the summary on the back. People can make their own decisions, and can therefor choose wether or not to read the book to begin with. The books that would be found innapropriate or offensive would most likely be in teen novels or adult literature. If this is the case, they should be mature enough to handle stumbling across the material, and or making the decision to put the book back and to not continue reading.      Saying that the material is unsuitable for a younger age group is correct, but at that age the children should be with @CAPS1 adult when checking out books anyway. The material that people find unacceptable would almost certainly be in a novel that is intended for a mature audience, so if it is being read by a younger age group that would be the problem in and of it's self. The teens and or adults whom would be reading such material is surely old enough to handle reading a few foul words and scattered inuendos thoughout the plot.      The material that @MONTH1 be found innapropriate or offensive @MONTH1 be viewed differently given two different audiences. A teen in high school has probably heard worse in the halls durring passing; @CAPS1 adult that is worring about what their children read has certainly been exposed to enough thoughout their lifetime to either look past the text or to put it away. The material being called offensive just because of one person's views in not rite. The tough situations and our surroundings are what prepair us for our futures. A person seeing the bad in life would be more likely to do all in their power to make good of their futures and be more willing to help make shure it could be prevented.      Should the foul things in life be ignored? Should the child that is being beaten at home have to suffer in silence because it seems too graphic to tell? The man who became homeless, only to turn his life around because he learned from his past, should that story not be told only because the troubles he had to face seem too disturbing?      I believe that these are the stories that need told the most, in @CAPS1 attempt to teach those around us how to prevent, and how to move past the troubles in life. There will always be things that we wish not to see in life. But is it not our actions that follow seeing such misfortunes that determine who we are. The libraries should not be put on a cencorship, but open to the public that wish to dive in to these stories. Books are written for a purpose, and that purpose @MONTH1 just be to let people know that these things are happening, and if one thinks  they are alone in these strifes that they are not",4,4
4037,"Offensive much? Thats what multiple people feel towards curtain books. For instence if @CAPS5 was the bible and you were an athiest, or a person who doesn't believe in god, then the bible @MONTH1 be offensive and hurtfull to you. I feel as a student that there are so many people in the world that by the time everyone inserts their own feelings by taking away books then we would have nothing left to read. You see, everyone is different in their own way, so books, magazines and music wouldn't be around because everyone feels differently about different subjects. I feel that they are a resourse that is very helpfull, and multiple times knowledgeable on many grasping subjects.      First, besides books, we have magazines. If we would get rid of all of the magazines in the world then there would be a cut down on all those horrible advertisements that men long for. Second there would be less gossip. Most magazines are about @PERCENT1 gossip about the recent break-ups, and make-ups, of todays modern celebritys. I feel that the magazines are a waste of time because they hurt peoples feelings, also its offensive the way that some famous people act. I strongly believe we should take magazines off the shelves.     Lastly there is music. Some of the greatest inspiration comes from music. Don't you remember the song, 'We @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3?' @CAPS4 if you don't then i'll tell you a little about @CAPS5. @CAPS5's about america, things that have happened in the past and were a big deal. In the chorus @CAPS5 says, '-we @CAPS1't @CAPS2 the @CAPS3,- but we tried to fight @CAPS5. @CAPS5's always been burning since the worlds been turning.' @CAPS5's a song that is about americans saying that they @CAPS1't cause panic and such things, but that since the begining of time @CAPS5 already was. The song inspired many of the famous singers you @CAPS4 know. Elvis @CAPS6 is one of the many that you should know. We should keep music out so people, like me, who have been inspired, can inspire others. Music helps the blind, heals those who are sick, and give hope to americans. Without mucis there would be chaos.     Last and furthermore is movies, where would we be without movies? We need movies, not just for our intertainment, but some of the best movies are historical events. Events that help us get a better grasp and keen look at what has happened in the past. For instince the movie @CAPS7, and @LOCATION1, even the movie The @CAPS8 @CAPS9, they all help us picture events that have happened and are very enjoyable but also very educational. We should keep movies, there is no doubt in my mind.     In conclusion I hope I have created a clear message that you will take into consideration highly. We need books and music to inspire and electrify the world, and magazines we need not. We all need a little inspiration in our down spiraling lives, and we need education. Not the kind that we wish to see but the kind we need to see. I hope I have made a positive inpact on your thoughts, and feelings.",3,3
3581,"Hi im henry and I agree that if there are books in a school libray or a public libray that are offensive they should be removed. im a type of person who belives that offensive books shouldnt be in librays because i ahte seeing people upset or mad  because they read a book that effened them. That inclues magazines and movies and even music.       myself henry has read a few books that has effened my self or has made fun of black people and i have black friends. if I could have it my way i would have all books like that out of school librays and public librays. And i say that because little kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff and neither do we. thats just like music now days you turn on a radio station and people are cussing and making fun of other colored people. Also you cant understand what there saying half the time. They need to put on music that u can understand that doesnt have cussing in it and that you can understand because some kids like to listen to music.     magazines, I look at alot of magazines my self but there all like coonhunting magazines or four-wheeler ones lookin for tires or somthing like that. but yes also the bad magazines need t go to that way little kids arent looking at them. also it mite help some crime to stop to. I say that because people look at magazines that have shooting in then and that have crime in them to. So people see that and there like i wanna try this somtime. so then they call there buddies and say lets try this and most of them do then there in trouble. so i think that it would be helpful to get all the bad magazines that were made and throw them away and things mite change. make some that have like cartoons in them and comics for the little kids. you could even try and make some good health ones that advertise good health for people and teens. To me things would possibly change if we get all the  naughty things out of book,magazines,music.     Movies, this is a big one just about all the movies are bad. There are some good ones out there if u look. but i dont know how we could change the movies by anycahnce at all.     That was my opion on things. i hope it all makes sense about how i feel and how i think about things.",3,3
3396,"First of all, Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazined, etc, should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive, thats question should not be ask ever in life.      Why beacuse there are many people out there that read read stuff and listen to stuff that you might not like at all. when i first saw this question i answer to my self that, ''That if all people think the same way this world would be boring, and i answer the question by saying that there should not be any books remove or music remove, from any shelves' why beacause we all don tlike the same thing or do the same thing.     In first place, I know that there are many different kind of thing that people beacause they love doing it and some dont do those kind of things beacause they really dont like or dont care about it. This is answering the question about removing books, music, or magazines from shelves even if the article the book, music, etc, say's or if its offensive to other people, that is not a reason to remove stuff. There are thing that you enjoy doing and things that you emjoy reading, listening, and looking, etc that other people dont like or hate about it.     In second place, not only beacause you dont like something people should stop doing those things or stop buying those thing, NO!!, that is not the case here @CAPS1. or @CAPS2. you should not care just for you or do what ever is right for you. If you are a good person that wants to be someone in the future dont just care about you care about the other too, beacause you'll need those person or those book in the future when ever your falling down.     In my conclusion, about this article. I think that people should not remove any thing from any library even if its found offensive to other people, those thing help other in life to do what they really want to do, while other are getting hurt for those offensive this that are writting on a little peace of paper. Hope this latter help you all think about and change your decision about this case, hope you all make the right decision that would not affect anyone in general.     Thank you for taking your time to ready what I really think about removing articles from libraries",3,4
3939,"There are many inapropriate types of intertainment in the world but does that mean we should take them all away? I believe that censoring things such as books, movies and music in a library is not a good idea. We would not have any diversity in the world or any type of intertainment because everyone has a different view on what they think is offensive or inapropriate.     With censoring materials in a library it will extremly limit on what we can learn. For example if someone thought that a book about how an animal catches it pray was offensive then if a person was interested in learnig about that topic they would not able to. Many peoples only way of reserch is at a library, so if they had on assignment for work and they could only get informatoin on it there they would not be able to finish their job if only one person thought a book about that topic was offincive. Also people in the medical feild have to watch many movies deminstrating sertain proseedures. What would they do if one person thought that a movie on what they were doing was offensive? They might not be able to save a persons life.     With censoring there would be no diverstiy. Censoring would cause us to have a very small choise in what we could read for intertainment. It might even cause us to not have any books to read for intertainment because it one person does not like a sertain book it can be gotten rid of. So if not all the books are gone there is still going to be a few books to chose from. It would cause all to read the same books therefor making the diverstiy very small.     I see only a few good points in censoring. Yes, it would prevent children from learning or hearing about inapropriate or offensive things but, that is what is in our world and i believe that we just have to accept it. Our society today is filled with crime, haterid, sexually things, and profanity but there is no changing that. Censoring @MONTH1 hide that for a small amount of time but its not going to keep it away forever. Censoring is not going to change our society.     I do not think that we should censor thing in our libaries. It can only lead to a downfall in our communitys. It is a great idea but i do not believe that it can help us more than it would hurt us. Censoring will cuz a lack in diversity education and a realization of our society",4,3
3216,"Libraries are a place that provides people of all ages the oppurtunity to read any book, watch any movie, or listen to any music all for free and for a certain period of time.  When people grow up, they tend to start reading, watching, and listening to material that they would never let their children listen to.  Since books are read privately and movies and music are played publicly, books should not be taken from the shelves and only very bad movies and music should leave the library.     Books have always been a way for people to get away from their life and into their own story world.  Normally when people read a book, they don't read it in a group unless they are in a reading group discussing certain books.  If someone wanted to read a book that was innappropriate for their children, let them do it; it's not hurting the children that they have been reading innappropriate topics, it will only hurt them if that child finds the book that should have been hidden in a better place.  For example, @PERSON1 read the book 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', which had some innappropriate content for a child in there, but not so bad that it would be heinous.  @PERSON1 will read the book in her own mind while finding it in the adult section of the library far from children; this scenario is how it should be.  Although, if a library is putting adult books near children's books, they need to redesign to keep kids from accidentally walking into the adult section.  Books can be kept from kids if hidden well enough, but movies and music can not be hidden in the same manner.     Movies and music are a great way to kick back and relax after a long day, unless your kids are around.  Keeping kids out of the room is a near impossible task, whether it is actually watching the movie or hearing the movie through his bedroom wall.  Music can of course be listened to through headphones, but what happens when you leave a @CAPS3 is left in the car and a child is sent in that car to wait for his parents to get in?  The parents might tell their child to start the car for them and the music will be playing away.  The movies and music were from the library, a place where the child thinks that there would never be something such disgraceful material as what their parents are watching and listening to, ruining their good thoughts of the library.  Libraries need to either get rid of all nasty content pertaining to movies and music or if their main business is that and can't seem to give it up, just put the content as far away as possible from the children.     As said above, libraries need to remove all content that has potential to be exposed to children and destroy their innocent minds.  Libraries are a place where kids can have fun picking out whatever book they wish to read, not a place where parents can pick up items that might spoil that child's brain",4,3
4739,"I believe that censorship in libraries can be a good thing, but can go too far. Removing movies and magazines that contain pointless offensive material from the shelves could be a good thing. If those are removed I do not think that people would care that much. Removing those small things, however, could grow into a bigger problem. It has to be decided how far is too far when removing objects from the shelves.     It all starts with a bad magazine that has a bad picture of a movie star doing something offensive with text surrounding it being pointlessly judgemental. A parent sees his or her kid reading this at the library and they do not believe it is appropriate so they complain and the magazine is taken off the shelf. Then a movie arises that is offensive and it is taken off the shelf. Pretty soon everyone is comming in with minor complaints about many different things and almost everything has someone who wants it banned.     Even if there was a set limit on what qualifies as able to be banned people would still complain until what they want happens. If the government has all these complaints they might just shut down the libraries to avoid looking over every 'offensive' piece of literature, film, or artwork. The original purpose being to block out offensive meterial ends with the realization that everything is offensive to somebody. Even what might be considered a great piece of work by most could be considered an abomination by some.     In the end a library should not be given the right to censor anything. The things that should be censored are a very small percentage and it is not worth the risk. Books that are offensive to some serve as inspiration to others. Libraries were made to give people the chance to be inspired. The library should not have the right to take inspiration away from the reader's hand.",3,4
3114,"Many people go to libraries; such as children, parents, and grandparents. I have come to realize that their purpose for going to this community loving place is to find peace and quiet. Some don't even go there for the books. They will engage in music, magazine, enjoy a cup of coffee, or simply get on the internet. Now some people argue that some of the books, music, and movies in libraries are inappropriate or offensive, but does that mean the libraries should have to get rid of them?     These materials people find offensive have no reason to be banned. First of all, the libraries will lose customers. There is a majority of people in the world who really like listening to rap or @CAPS1&@CAPS2. It's hard to find that kind of music without cuss words or sexual inuendo. Even I will listen to that type of stuff occasionally just so that I can have a cool beat stuck in my head for a while. Plus, when you are in a library and listening to music you will have head phones on, which isn't disruptive to other in or around the library.     Secondly, customers who don't like the context of these materials don't have to get them. If there is a book that has a sex scene or talks about drugs then don't read it. You have a choice to what book you would like to read and if that isn't your style then there are plenty of other aisles and children books you can look through. Those who are interested in those topics still deserve to be able to choose those books. I have been to my public library many atimes and all the times I have been there I have not once even seen a book, music, or a movie that looks displeasing to the eyes. So if you're a person who wants an offensive book, then it takes A @CAPS3 of looking, not just a quick little scan.     Finally, freedom. Isn't that was @CAPS4 is all about? The freedom of speech, and religion, and even what type of movies you want to watch. I know this might come as a shocker, but there are labels on the back of movies that tell whether it is @CAPS5, @LOCATION1, @LOCATION1@NUM1, or @CAPS1. It also includes the not-so-nice content that will be present in the movie. So you have total freedom to purchase(check out) any of those rated movies. Like I explained clearly earlier, you aren't forced to watch any of the naughtier movies, so just pick what you want and be happy.      As you can see, there is absolutely no reason to remove offensive books, music, or movies. There are many different types and styles of these categories and it isn't disturbing anyone. Libraries will lose customers, people dont have to choose the less appropriate things, and us @CAPS7 have freedom to do what we please, especially with what we would like to read, listen to, or watch. So save youself some time and just keep the few so called 'offensive' materials.",4,4
4347,"When i go to the library, most of the time, I'm doing research on a specific topic. The information I want, is the facts that really happened, or took place. This would not be possible if they censored all the material the offended somebody.     Leaving libraries uncensored gives us the full effect of what we're reading, or researching. It is important for readers and researches, to connect and take in all the information they read. That is what keeps us interested in what we are doing.     Authors write the things they write, for a reason. Taking there hard work off the shelves, because some little thing offends someone, is not fair to them. Besides, either way, someone is getting offended, because the auther is goin to get offended, for taking his hard work off the shelves.     As you @MONTH1 tell, i am against censoring our libraries. The way i see it, is that if something offends you, then dont look at it",3,3
4745,"'Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?' @CAPS1 these items should be taken off the shelves if found offensive.  First off, they should be removed because some people @MONTH1 be offended by them. Some @MONTH1 talk about race, religion or gender. Nobody wants to be criticized in a book or such. For example: rap music, all that is, is just people taking about what color they are or how big or small they are. Some people @MONTH1 be offended, and im sure no parent wants their child to be listening to that nonsense. So take them off the radio. Second off, if a child gets ahold of a criticizing book or movie or such that item can have a bad affect in the later future. They could start criticizing people for being different. Some books talk about religion, some people just cannot help their religion, they were born that way so they are familiar with it and do not want to change. No one should be judged for their religion, so take them off the shelves. Thirdly, my friend was watching a movie and it was about a female that liked the same sex, and in that movie they were making fun of her. No one should be judged by which sex they like. She was very offended. So take them off the shelves. Second to last, magazine authors take pictures of celebrities and down size them about three sizes smaller than what they really are and put them on the cover of fashion magazines or such. Why not just put that celebrity on there as the size they really are? Some @MONTH1 take offense to that. So just take pictures of celebrity and put them on the magazine as their real size or take them off the shelves. In conclusion,  in some of my observations and reading some people get offended quite often for being a different race, gender, or  religion. So I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be taken off the shelves if they are found offensive",3,3
3506,"I personally think that certain materials that are found offensive should not be removed from shelves. I think this because it's parent's responsibilities to keep track of what their children read, watch, or listen to. You can't get away from things that are offensive to some and everybody has a right to do what they want.     The first reason why I don't think offensive material should be removed from shelves is because it is the parents duty to watch what their kids are doing. If parents don't want their children to observe this stuff, then they should keep it off limits. I have heard some parents claim that they didn't know what the material was like, but that is why they made warnings. That is no excuse.      The second reason for not removing offensive material is that there is no way to get away from it. Now a days, material that is offensive to some is all around. Shows, movies,and music, they all have something not suitable for all audiences. Plus children will learn about this offensive material sometime in their life anyway. If they do not hear about it in movies or magazines, they are probably hearing about it at school. These days children learn about things sooner and sooner.        The third reason offensive material should not be removed from shelves is that everyone has a right to read or listen to whatever they want. It is up to them as to what they want to watch, not everybody else. They should be able to go in a place and buy something that they want to watch and not get questioned about it.     That is why I don't think offensive material should be removed. It is the parent's responsibilities, you can't get away from it, and everybody has a right to do what they want. A way to help with this problem is to move offensive material to a higher shelf. This would make parents of younger children happy, but also the people wanting to view this material happy. This way you are not completely removing it, but making it harder for younger audiences to get to it",4,4
3372,"Yes, I think they should be removed from the shevles. Some books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are overated and young children go to visit the library. They should have a shelve for kids, tennagers and grown-ups. Everybody should have they own section for their age group.          Young kids are already doing things that they shouldn't be doing, like hanging out in the street, hang with older kids. They watch inappropriate movies, when they should be watching something educational. The music they have out now days, children shouldn't listen to it. It's to much cursing and violent. More parents need to spend more time with their kids and talk to them about these things.          There are certain things tennagers should watch and read too. I don't think they should read about killing or sex. I rather their parents talk to them about that and stop hiding things from them. Parents will eventually find out what you doing behind close doors, they been through everything you doing or trying to do now. So just talk to them and be real about things.          I think they should be certain magazines in the library. Young children beat theyselves up, because they don't look like the young actors and actress in the magazines. They try to rush their life and be somebody they not meant to be. Young ladies want to have big boobs and butt. Then, young men want to have big mucles and be buff.          In conclusion, I don't think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be removed from the shelves. There should be a shelve for young kids, tennages and adults. The music that is played on the radio now days, shouldn't be on there. Magazines shouldn't out on shelves for children to reach. There are certain things tennagers should watch and read.",3,3
3567,"There are many types of reading materials for people to read in a library. You can find things on cars, trucks, sports, and made up stories for fun. There are some materials in a library though that could be offensive. But should those materials be removed from the library? Some think that they should and others think that they shouldn't be.     In my opinion I don't think that things should be removed from a library. Certain people @MONTH1 find things offensive and others @MONTH1 think it is perfectly fine to have in a library. I think there should be certain areas and age limits for certain materials a person could find in  library.     I think that there should be age limits for certain types of reading material. People don't want a little child to read something that is meant to be for an adult. That would teach kids bad things that they don't need to be reading about. I think that there should be an area set for kids that are in elementary to high school and there should be a section that is for adults. That way kids aren't reading things that are meant for adults.     I also think that are there should be more signs that show more about what some books are about. Like if there are books on slavery they should have an area for books that are about that that way people who are offended be it know to stay away from it. The same with magazines. i don't think they should be removed from a library if they are found offensive to some people because other people @MONTH1 enjoy reading them.     Some reading material @MONTH1 be found offensive to certain people but to othersit @MONTH1 not be. I think things shouldn't be removed from libraries. There are some things that people @MONTH1 need have in a library if they are doing a project that way they have the resources to do it.     I do think that certain movies and music should be removed from shelves if little kids are aloud in the store. kids don't nedd to be watching adult movies while they are in elementary school. That just isn't right. Espaecially if the movie is promoting sex, violence, and other things that young kids should not be doing.     So in my opinion there are some things that should and should not be removed from a library. Music and movies that promote things that young children should not be doing. Magazines and other things should be kept away to where only adults could get to them",4,4
4237,"Many things such as books, music, magazines, ect., causes problem acts for children to act different, but i say that everything should stay in the library because there more things that causes acts than the things that are listed. Many children get their acts from books, movies, and magazines but most get their acts from something different.   Children gets most of their acts from the television that their viewing at home wich causes them to think if their parents doesn't care about what their watching than it's okay to view what ever.So the most that is causing acts is what is being viewed at homes or in the movies. So I really say that it's okay for children to read or watch what evers legal on television.   But to me in the the libraries it's up to whoms ever controling it should decide by ages. just like legal things only legal for adults. I say that it's only for adults because childern starts argument from what ever they see expecially when their around their friends. When children is around their friends they feel that it's cool to do what ever. And it's all coming from thing based on violence in the books that children reads more often. So to me I will say that it shouldnt be okay for what is being viewed.",3,3
4560,I do not really read books. I think that offensive things sould be tooken off shelves because there could be a sene if they are'nt. There are many people who will fight if they are truely offended and it is not a pretty sight.,2,2
3541,"Do you think that books that have vulgar things in them should be on libaries shelfs?  We all know that there are books out there are parents hope we never get a hold of.  In this time try and find a good action movie without cuss words in it.  It is nearly immposible to do that.  Just because books have vulgar language, blood and gour, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled off the shelf.     Have you seen the banned book list lately?  I have and some of those books on there are ridciolus.  Here are a few @PERSON2, @PERSON1, @CAPS1 @CAPS2, and @CAPS3 @PERSON2's @CAPS4.  I could go on and on, the list is a mile long.  Some of these books have historical meanings behind them.  There is also morals behind them. I think that books should not be pulled from the self because they have a few bad words in them.  It's not liuke we have never heard them words.     In @CAPS3 @PERSON2's @CAPS4 they have banned it from schyools because of the use of the word 'nigger'.  This is not a nice word in our day and time. Back when we had slaves that is what they were called.  It is points and views from an anti-slavery author.  In @CAPS7 @CAPS8 it is banned because of animals talking.  Come on really they have animals in movies that talk all the time.  I belive that if kids don't no that animals cant really talk we might have problems.     Do you find the show @PERSON3 the @CAPS9 offensive?  Well it has been banned because @CAPS10 is racit against @CAPS11.  I would like to no how some of these people come up with this at.  Whoever picks up this offensive matrial has a choice wheater or not they read it.  It should be on the shelf even if it is offensive.  I belive that it is totally up to you, if you read it.  Just like if you go to a mvie store they have the movies rated.  You dont want to watch rated @CAPS12 movies then dont rent it.  They could use the same method with books.     Do you still think offensive books should be pulled from shelfs?  If you say yes, I would like to no why.  It is your choice to read it. There are already all these other banned books out there why ban any more.  Just because books have vulgar lanuage, blood and gour, and sexual things, doesn't mean they should be pulled from shelfs.",4,4
4750,There should not be sensorship on the books in the library just think of how many great pieces of literature out there that no one would be able to get there hands because they didn't reach your standards. People wouldn't be able to reads some of their favor right books. Would you really want to take that from the people? If my arguement did' change your mind you copuld atleast put the sensored books behind the counter.,2,2
4535,"The books, magazines, music, and movies shouldn't be removed from the shelves.  They still have good information that someone other than you @MONTH1 want to know.  If you take them off of the shelves the people that want to use them don't have the opportunity.   If you remove books then if someone needs one for a reseach paper that they have to do they will not have the nessisary resouces to do the paper, and at the same time the person with the paper @MONTH1 feel that the non-educational books need to come off the shelves and then that person wont have the books that they want.     If they want the book taken off of the shelf, because of inopropriate language or nudity then the libraries can make a spot that you have to be a certain age to access them. I wasw at the library and there was a woman getting upset, because her son had a movie and book that she didn't think was good for him to have.  The, book and the movie, that he had were in a different area so that minors weren't suposed to get them.  So the woman would be the one that would probibly want to take them off of the shelves, but it wasn't the libraries fualt that he wasn't where he was supposed to be.      The products should stay on the shelves, because someone needs it for something or it wouldn't have been there in the first place.  If they take the products down that certain people don't like then the people that do like it will not have it.  If there are resons that people must have the product off of a shelf then the product should go somewhere else that can be accessed by the people that do want to you the products.  The products should stay on the shelves  so that the people who need, or just want to use the products can use the products.",2,3
3158,"I feel that they shouldnt be removed due to the fact that somebody else @MONTH1 like that movie, book, music, or magazine. Just becuase we might not like it doesnt mean theirs somebodyout there that do. Everything shuld be in the library becuase their are different people and not everybody like the same things.      The library suppose to have everything so if we declared to take something off the shelf becuase due to the fact one or a couple more people dont like something or whats being displayed out to people it wouldnt be right. I have been to the library and looking for an movie or a book that i like or want to see and it have not been there i have got mad for that. So ifeel as if it's not right nor fair. Everybody should have their right to what ever it is that they read or like to watch.

4091,"Removing certain books,music,movies,magazines,and so on is a serious question to ask.Well,some believe its a good idea,on the other hand other people dont. If you ask my opinion I would have to side with not removing certain books,movies,music,etc.     One of the many reasons why I believe we should not remove them is because everyone is entitled their own opinion.Some @MONTH1 find a book offensive,well on the other hand some @MONTH1 find it riviting and not offensive at all. If the person thinks the book is offensive they should simpily not read it.They should not have to band books,music,movies,etc. just because some find it offensive .Well others @MONTH1 find things offensive that the other person does not .We all have are own beliefes and we should be free to express them,as long as it doesnt involve breaking any laws.     Another reason why I agree with not removing certain books,movies,and so on is because we might not have any left.Like i said before we all have our own opinions.Not every single person is going to say a book,etc. doesnt offend them.We should not have to take away certain items.But on the other hand i believe we should restrict certain books,moves,music,etc. If a book,movie,etc.,seems to complicated for a child to comprehend,then they should not be able to read,watch,etc.,the item.We should classify things based on knowledge,understanding,and maturity.     Also I believe we all have a right to believe what we want to believe. Just as we all have choices.I can agree with some of the arguments other people have for removing certain books,and movies,etc.,but the main idea is to do what is best for everyone.I just dont see that removing every book,movie,music,etc.,will solve any problems .In fact I truly believe it would make matters worse.Their would be arguments of what to remove and what not to.     In conclusion I belive we should keep libraires the way they are.It would keep things less complicated. Also it would be the best choice. i\",3,4
3580,"I dont think books that would affend people should be on the shelf. some of the books that maybe on the shelf @MONTH1 hurt some ones feelings. But i also think people should beable to read what they want to read. many people wouldnt read a book that they think would affend them.      There are many kinds of books not all book will be bad or affend people. but books that are not apropriot for young kids or teens shouldnt even be in school librarys. In public librarys i think it should be ok to have every type of book. and have different books in different place's. like haveing the young adalt section and the adalt and children section.     I think screton books should be sold in book stores like i dont think they should have inapropeiout books in children book store's. They should have a different store for certain books. And parents should monitor what there children are reading and take part in the book by helping them understand what the book is saying.      There are lots of parents that dont really care about what there kids read, and to me that's there busness but my apenioun is that they shouldn't let there kids read what they want. Parents should be with the child when he/she is picking out a book. But if it is a teen @DATE1 and older, i think they would be old enough to choise what they want to read. by the time they are that age they have matured enough to read and understand things much easer",3,3

I feel if there are books ,movies,or music that are saying or showing a form of insluts then it depends on who is being offended.      If you have a racist book against all races like blacks,asian,or mexican etc... other minorities @MONTH1 find out about those forms of insults and they raise an issue about it, then yes take it off the shelves.      If you have a confrontation about it then it could get violent . Also, if you dont then they could sue you for racism or make it public to everyone that you are a racist library and you would loose business.      So to avoid all of the fighting and  lawsuits and other humiliation against you and the other minorites. If they bring up a situation then just take it off the shelves so you can stay safe and them as well.           Plus , they only come here for an oppurtunity to start a new life cause usually they're coming from poverty srticken towns, homes countries. I myself, am not a racist person I think that we are equal just unique individuals we're all unique in our own ways  that is what makes us who we are today.",3,2
3500,"I don't think they should take down any book because they were donated to us in the first place.Also,I dont think they should take them down because it helps us learn about what other people went through in there lifetime.Look at it and try to live life as you would in another persons shoes.Try to see where they come from and there life style.Im not as big reader or anything but wants I get that one book that just catches my eye and sounds good to read I look at it and if it is good I would take it and read for a long time because I want to know what happens next in the book.So I keep reading and reading and like in the middle of the story my teacher makes me stop reading.I would read as long as it takes but it just has to be the right book for me.I like all kinds of books from sports to sad emotional books.I like reading out loud to myself it helps me understand a little bit better.",2,2
4522,"Im alot of things but i am surley not a reader.But i do believe that you should be able to publish anything that you want over any topic. weather that be a grafic novle or a didry maggazine. nothing should be taken off the shelf for being offencive if it offends you dont pick it up or much less read it.      Say i wanted to write a book but people say it was too disgusting, i would still be able to write it and sell it. anything that anyone has a problem with they try to band or get rid of it. instead why dont they just get over it? we have rights every individual person from me to you we all have them, and should be able to use them to the full exstent of what they can be used for.     Call me old fashoned but, I beleive in freedom of speach and the freedoms that we have lost solders over and the freedoms we have every single day we live. I think drinking every @DATE1 of the week is wrong but, you dont see me on the news yelling about it no i deal with it just like people should deal with the things they dont like.      so i hope in this essay ive made good points in making sacrifices and dealing with things and not act on something you shouldent be able to change, thank you for taking the time to read this.",3,3
3646,"In @DATE1's world there are so many things around our children that if we tried to take materials away, we would be take most of what is made for entertainment. Many adults say that our world has changed so much from the time when they were younger. Well, why don't we do something about it? People need to stop complaining about everything and just do something. Adults can eliminate the amount of materials the children take home with them.      If you were to walk into any store these days you would find something that you would not want your children to watch, see, or listen to. I believe people are doing the best they can to seperate these materials from the family oriented materials. Sometimes it is just not enough, children are still getting addicted to some materials at a very early age. These children share what they have with their friends, and these other children start doing the same things.        Many materials such as movies and music have negative ideas that teach children things they do not need to know or learn. The material that talks about drugs, parties, and drinking does not even need to be on a radio station or a television channel that a young child would listen to. Our adults need to also learn that it is not good for the children to learn and listen to these things, and to keep their children away from it as much as possible.     Like the author said if everyone was able to take something off of the shelves there would not be anything left. We are always going to have these things that we do not want children to see, but we can start to eliminate some of them. The others we can not eliminate we can continue to keep on the shelves and other places, but just kept where children don't go.     I believe that our towns and cities can do a better job of keeping our children away from @CAPS1 rated movies, negative songs, and different books that talk about 'adult things.' The children are the future of the world. If that's all they are watching and thinking about then it does not look good for the future. There are many things we can do to stop our children from watching, listening, and learning about these negative things in life. Keep the children away from these materials, it will be a better world if we do.",4,4
4442,"A few months ago I was at the local library searching for the perfect book. After an hour of searching I decided on one. I was happy with my choice as I checked it out. As I anxiously started reading my book, I found language, drug abuse, and sexual content. As a teenager, I do not want or need to be exposed to any innapropriate material. No one should be exposed to that, and because of that experiance, I believe that censorship in libraries is a must.     Due to sexual content, drug abuse, and vulgar language, one must be seventeen to purchase a ticket for a rated-@CAPS1 movie. I believe that since that is true for movies, it should also be true for books, magazines, and music. @CAPS2 literature is not necessary and innapropriate for any age. The world exposes certain literature to children, and then is shocked when they see children in jails, gangs, and other horrible situations.     The world has set their standards too low, and the children of todays society are following after our footsteps. Author, Katherine Paterson once said,     '...if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right so does everyone else.' @CAPS2 quote shows the impact that people have on generations to come.     Everyone has their own opinion and @CAPS2 is mine. As a daily newspaper reader, I could not quiet my voice any longer. I had to step-up and say something. I am apart of a generation that is being affected greatly by the world in a negative way. The first step to changing that is to set the standards high. Protect the future generations and censor what children are allowed to be exposed to. Situations will become better when libraries choose to censor and remove offensive materials from shelves. If libraries censor materials, then next time I wnat to find the perfect book, I will.",4,3
3276,"That saying Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I disagree with that statement. I think it is the goverment's choice if these items should be taken out of libraries or not. So we will need ligitement reason's to take some books off the shelf.     Some people think we should take books off the shelf that teach the kid's our history. People don't have that right to take away from children. In the statement Katherine made, she is supporting that very idea; taking away our kids right to learn US history. The kids have that right to learn our very own history and some people want to take that away. Then what will our future generation be like. Some kid's might not even know who @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is or how we got here to this very continent.     Parents also don't want us to read anything in books that have foul language or anything to do with nudity. I see what theese parents are trying to do. They are trying to protect their children, but the fact is people are going to have to go through this in life and if they arn't introduced at a younger age what will they do when they are older. Some kids that have that right taken away from will have no idea what to do when they get older and the foul language in the texts of theese books put voice into the books. We don't want the up coming generations to be blind to all of this because it is the real world.     When I was was in fifth grade I liked to read alot. I really liked the adventure books such a the boxcar children and books like that. One time I went into the library and I picked out a book about a haunted house. The librarian would not let me check the book out because there were some texts in the book not apropriate for me. That sort of crushed my reading spirit and I really never wanted to go and check out a book by myself any more. So adults that want to take theese books of the shelves you might be stopping our generation from learning and if we don't learn then our next generation isn't going to want to read anything or learn.     Theese are just a couple of reason we should not take books, magazines, movies, and music away from us. There are more people out there that have reasons to, so if you want to take this right away from us then be prepared for an argument because will fight for this right. So you adults who want to take that book off the shelf, you better have real good ligitement reason to take it off.",3,4
4032,"I think people read more books that are banned from schools and libraries, they listen to 'rebel' music, or they just watch controvesial movies, so is censoring really effective? I do not think censoring  is really necessary. If you think a subject might be offensive for you, you should not read it. instead of censoring the products in a library we should censor the readers, I believe people are mature enough to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen. Media is just another way to gain knowledge that's why they are used at school.       I would like to go to my school library and find books like, 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2', I know this book is considered as one of @LOCATION1's most famous literature work, but it was once banned from some schools around the nation. The reason of the banning was that they believed that the book contained pornography, and it wasn't school appropiate. My english teacher used this method, by telling us this, to encourage us to read it. My classmates who hadn't read the book wanted to find the pornography in it, if you were to ask me... I did not find it. Another literary work which was banned once is 'The @CAPS3 of @ORGANIZATION1', this book was banned because @PERSON1, a black character in the book, was called a @CAPS4,and thought to be stupid sometimes during the book. Even though @PERSON1 is the most noble and innocent character in the book, some people found this offensive and not appropiate. Movies with strong language are rated for it's public so I don't think this should be a problem. Music in the other hand, depends on the singer's music style and that should be monitored by parents.     I trully believe that we should not censor any material in libraries, but if it's necessary, they could stablish an age limit to check-out any controversial material. As I said before, media is just another way to gain knowledge",3,3
3797,"Censorship has become a major part of the media now-a-days. It is everywhere: books, movies, songs, and television shows. The government is trying to make the children of @DATE1 less corrupt, but they will end up learning everything that is censored for their friends and peers anyways. I feel censorship is a waste of time for the government. Children learn mature information sooner than they should in @DATE1's society.     Censorship should be more for the media children and young teens pay attention to. It should not be put into more mature movies and music, such as movies with adult content and rap. Those are more of items for grown up and teenagers than for children. If parents allow their children to listen to and watch that certain media, then they must feel their children are mature enough and know enough to not be majorly effected by it. Censorship also ruins the quality of books, music, and movies.     Certain words help to better express people and their views. If they can not use the specific word they feel describes them the best, it tends to ruin the quality of their character. People cannot be themselves when they have to watch what they say and are looked down upon because of their choice of language. I, myself, am very free with my language and the inappropriate and vulgar things I say. They are just a part of my nature and help me to be more expressive of myself. There are probably better, more appropriate words to use when I am in public, but then I would not feel like I am being quite myself. I think censorship is corrupting our society.     The government is trying to control us with censorship. I am not one of those paranoid people that thinks the government is out to get them. This just happens to be one of my opinions of censorship. We should get rid of it. It is changing the way people are and the way they feel they can act around others. People have to be careful of what they say, and I feel that makes speaking and attempting to express yourself so much more challenging. Censorship should be stopped before it ruins the quality of all the media.",3,3
3358,"People see libraries as a good place for knowlodge and just an information place, many people like them and some dread of the fact of hearing the word, '@CAPS1'. To be honust I only know a handful of people who use libraries in my life as a source for information now days but; Can some information from libraries be offencive to others? The answer is based by your own opinion to be quite honust, but yes I think some iformation that can be picked up from your local @CAPS1 can be rather, disturbing 'per say'.  Theres books and information that you wish you would have never picked up in your whole life, then again thats everywhere.     Now music and movies etc. is sort of the same way, some @MONTH1 not agree with what he/she picks out and you know they might be interested in. Can it be offencive to people? The answer is of coarse it can, but because people will be people. You @MONTH1 not agree on something, but your friend might think entirely different from what you are thinking, everyone is titled to their opinion on anything, well normally. Now if they have graphic movies or explicit music on the shelf where your little son/daughter can just grab, I could see that as a major issue.     Some parents do not want their children listening to that music at such a young age, even though the way things are in america your child will hear or see those things, it's life. If that is the case where a five year old can pull a graphic movie or a cd that a parent doesn't want them to see or hear, then I do'nt nessasarily think it should be banned from the @CAPS1. I believe it should be handled well mannered and it should be moved, to a not so easy reach to a five year old. These are common arguements people have, about many places and about simular disagreements.      Yes, I agree some things found in a @CAPS1 can be found offencive to some but my answer stays as, 'No' it shouldn't be removed unless it really is that offencive. If there is something that offencive in the @CAPS1 and mutiple people find it offencive in the community, I would take it to the people in charge of the local @CAPS1",3,3
3835,"I believe that everyone should be free to read, listen or watch what they choose to. Anything publically exposed is goin to be seen anyhow. I think it shall be up to that person if they want to read something to mature or @ORGANIZATION1 for themself. If it is a child i think the parent shall be in charge of that decision not the libarian.     Books, movies, and music are forms of entertainment. People read @ORGANIZATION1 material to entertain themselves, and there is nothing wrong with entertainment. Everyone loves entertainment but to put a limit on it is unfair. If it is public that mean it should be released under certin circomstances or age, and maturity. Regaurdless of in a book or magazine everything that you dont want people to see will always show up somewere else, such as the tv or the internet.     The public library is were people go to get books to larn more about something so if u yake that book off the shelve someone might miss out on on  education about somthing. I wouldn't take any book off the shelf because it was put there to read, and it might be a good thing that child gets that book so that they have knowledge about somethings that are out there. If its there to read then let it be read instead of hiding it from them it only makes children more anxious to read or see it.        If its in a public library let it be read people and children shall be free to anything in the library unless other wise consented by a parent. anything publically exposed in a book, magazine or movie will be shown on the internet or tv so children will see what they want  rather elders' agree to it or not. Nudity, perfanity, violence, and provocative materialare in everything now days even cartoons so there is no way of kepping it from children or people its apart of everyday livng.",4,3
3373,"I honestly think that anything should be allowed in libraries. If you think about it, there is a law called freedom of speech. This law should be all the reason for someone not to ban something for what it says. Also, in my opinion, if you find it offensive, you dont have to look at it or read it or listen to it.     I remember walking threw the library in town and seeing a large quantity of books. None of these books really seemed offensive. Then again, this library had an upstairs that the more 'colorful' books were at. For example, some adult books etc. These books were offensive. They should not be banned though, they should only be moved.      On a different akasion, i remember walking threw the library trying to find a book to help me with an assignment at skool and i seen several young kids looking at some adult books and magazines. I belive that these were put here for advertisements, however, they should be advertised in different areas out of site of kids and teenagers.      Although it would be nice to see some books and magazines banned, it would be quite difficult to accomplish. I don't think that anything should ever be banned for what it says or shows or sounds like. Instead, moved from one area to a different area. For example, instead of showing certain things at low levels where younger people can get there hands on, they should be at a higher level or behind the desk.",3,3
3466,"What is censorship? Cenorship can be described as limitations or restrictions, and it can aslo be called common courtsy. The real question is what are we limiting?   Censorship is not something to support. Censorship to a book is like chocolate cake without the chocolate, its taking away the value and fun out of education. Though many @MONTH1 disapprove, libraries shouldn't censor their books, movies, or music because of that.      Some @MONTH1 find that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 of @PERSON1' are offensive books because of their repeated use of the '@CAPS4' word. There is also some arguement to that, there are several @CAPS5 @CAPS6 that I know that find the '@CAPS4' word offensive, but not in this case. They say that it brings more educational value to the book, because in the day of @PERSON1 the '@CAPS4' word was an excepted word. Thats just how it was back then.     Back then and now censorship is hiding reality. People who write, sing, and direct things that are considerd 'inapropriate' are the ones who are trying to set the truth free. The 'inapropriate' language, or experiences are the ones that really happen and are the words that are really said. By using censorship you are sheltering the world.      Cesorship is tool we use to block ourselves from reality. Is that the right choice? Is it right sending sheltered teens out in the world unable to fend for themselves? Or should we let them understand how it really works",3,3
4467,"I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 belive that any kind of material such as books, movies, magazines, ect., should be censored ecept for mature content such as pornography, violent and horrid movies and video games. But thats why we have @ORGANIZATION1's made. So when asked, we can show our age. Some age groups react diffrently to mature contents. Usually @NUM1 and up is a tollerable level for maturity to set in.     Maturity is maintained at diffrent paces in all age groups. For example, perhaps a @NUM2 year old is more mature than an @NUM3 year old. It is when you as a individual can act like a human being. Instead of like a pack of rabid wolves. Just because you do not act mature dosen'@CAPS2 mean you dont know how to be civilized.     The best way to prevent a child from discover something inapropriate or vulgure is to, seperate the books by an age grouping system. Keep adult videos out of site and reach of children. Also put saftey locks on your @CAPS2.V. to prevent kids from sneaking behind your back",3,3
3529,"There are millions of books and other media in libraries all across the world. Millions of people read and listen to those materials every day. Some people @MONTH1 like certain books or media and dislike others. Many people dislike certain materials because of their content. Everyone has the right to read and watch what they want and not everyone will read or watch the same materials. Although some materials @MONTH1 be offensive, they should not be removed from the libraries.     Books and other media should not be removed from library shelves because what some people find offensive does not offend other people. Everyone has a right to their own beliefs and opinions. If someone wants to read a book or watch a video, they should be able to. What is offensive and what is not is a personal choice and it all depends on that person's point of view. If someone thinks the content in a book, song, or movie is offensive, then they should not read or listen to it.     Materials should not be removed from libraries because they can be used to learn history and other things that people should know about. Take, for example, the @CAPS1. There are thousands of books on the @CAPS1 and many movies as well. These materials should not be removed from library shelves because even though some people find them offensive, they can be used to teach people how horrible it was so that it does not happen again. People should inform themselves about something before they view it so that they are not offended by the content inside. Some content in history is very mature and should only be viewed by mature audiences.     The offensive content should not be removed from libraries because it is usually in a mature section and it has a right to be there. Most content that some people find offensive is for adult audiences. There are not children's books that talk about things that parents would find offensive to their children. The content has a right to be there. If the author or publisher took the the time to create the work, then they should recieve credit for making it. In the @LOCATION1, there is freedom of speech and people should be able to say what they want to say. If the content is too offensive then it should be removed but only under special circumstances.     The content in libraries, offensive or not, should not be removed. People can read or watch whatever they want. Many people have many different opinions on what should and should not be in libraries. The libraries are public and they are shared. No one person has the right to dictate what should and should not be in libraries. If it was not for libraries, the people in society would not be as smart as they are",4,4
4183,"Should offensive material be censored?     Removing things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., that are found offensive could be both good and bad. It could be good because younger children wouldn't be exposed to things that are considered offensive. Although, it could be bad because it takes away from freedom of choice. Most young children don't know good from bad, so censoring these things for them could be good. Though, you shouldn't want to shelter your children from the real world. Protecting your children from things that offend you, @MONTH1 stop them from growing up badly. Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there.     Censoring or removing things that you find offensive @MONTH1 be a good idea. There are plenty of reasons someone @MONTH1 want to do this. A parent @MONTH1 not want their child to read, hear, or see something simply because it offends them. Another reason parents @MONTH1 want to censor these things is just because they don't want their child exposed to it. Parents know that most young children don't know right from wrong, so they'd like to make that choice for them. By doing this, a parent knows what their child is reading, hearing, or seeing. Some parents @MONTH1 feel that they need to protect their children from these things because it could be harmful to them. They also @MONTH1 feel this should be done so their child doesn't grow up badly.     Removing offensive material from shelves would take away from a person's freemdom of choice. Who wants to be told what they can and cannot read? If a parent does this to their child, it just sheltering them from the world around them. A child should be able to know the life around them before they grow up and are completely lost. Parents @MONTH1 think that this is good idea because it protects their children from things that @MONTH1 be considered bad. When really, protecting them could be harmful. Censoring books, movies, music, ect., won't stop what is already bought and out in our world. Offensive music, movies, books, ect., have already been bought and sold for years.     I feel that censoring or removing books, music, movies, magazines, ect., should not be done. It doesn't give people a choice. Some people @MONTH1 like reading graphic novels or things like that. Music is made for the enjoyment of the people. Some people like their music to talk about drugs or curse, why take that away from them? It just wouldn't be fair to take a choice away from someone. A movie is just a movie, it's not real. Just because something is done in a movie doesn't mean that a person will go off and do it. I think people should be able to have a choice.     Censoring such stuff now doesn't really change what is already out there. If people stopped to think about it, they would realize that offensive material has already been bought by others. Plenty of people have illegaly downloaded, or bought music that uses inapropriate language. This music is already in their iPods, @NUM1's, and burned onto @CAPS1, there's no removing it. Books that some @MONTH1 find offensive have already been printed and sold to others. One person @MONTH1 lend that book to another, therefore the offensive book is being spread around. Plenty of movies that involve adult content, violence, and drugs have been released into the media. Lots of people own these kinds of movies. So, why censor things now, when there's already unremovable offensive material out?",4,4
4043,"One book or movie doesn't make a difference in the huge library full of books and movies. Thats why the books, magazines, or movies shouldn't be removed from the book shelf of the library.     They shouldnt be removed because some parents of the children don't care what their kids listen to or read. Only if they are doing what the parent says. Also the parents might think to much of their kid and think that their kid knows what books you want them to get or don't get.     Although, if your one of those parents that not only care about what your children read or listen, and you realize that every kid doesnt know what their parent wants, then you should talk to the school's principle and see if there is a way that you could come up with an area of the library that is just for the books that have the wrong type of language or sex appeal that you don't want your children to have, or ever read, or you could ask them about a permission slip for the students to ask their parent if they care about these types of books.    Then there are some kids who like to read those types of books and would be very dissappointed if their favorite books got taken off the shelf, and they didn't have anything else to read, but everybody else in the school got to have their favorite books in school.     If someone where to tell me that the book is changing their lives into something that is unbearable. I would say to them that, its not the book. The kids chose to read the book in the first place, so it would be their own doing if their life changed.     Finally, thats the reason why books shouldnt be taken off the book shelf because some people like them, and if you are some of the kids or parents who dont like them or don't want their kids reading them, then have the librarian make a note to say they aren't aloud to check them out",3,3
4517,"The @CAPS1 on Books     In the world today, everything is showed every place you look. Libraries are used by many people, people go there to research, study, and even just to find an interesting book to read. One of the problems that some poeple are having is the exposing of personal things. I believe that libraries should have a censorship. Why should libraries have one? Here are my reasons why.     One reason why censorships in libraries are a smart idea is younger children search for books there. Any parent would tell you that they would strongly dislike the idea of their child reading something very detailed and adult like. A library should be a place where children, young adults and senior citizens can go to escape from reality not somewhere were they are worried about what book they might pull out from the shelf.      If libraries still want to keep certain books in stock, they should start an age limit on those books. Limiting the age on books will stop younger audiences from viewing them. Another thing they could do with the age limiting is parents could set the age limit with the library on when their child should be allowed to view certain books.     Also, another way that would help stop offensive viewing is parents looking at what their children are reading, watching and listening to. Parents could help by keeping an eye on what their child is doing.      Cenorships are a wonderful way of stopping the viewing of adult like issues. More public places should start a system of them. The world needs to understand that some audiences aren't ready for reality just yet",3,4
3252,"The contents of the books in libraries vary in many way. Some are children's books, some are adult books, and some are in between. Libraries have books that spark interest in a reader. Not all books are made for a particular age group or gender. Which that should not mean that a library should be picked apart because of the contents of the novel,magazines,music,or movies. A library is suppose to be for anyone that enjoys to read a variety of materials, not just a select few because some people don't like the text or the meanings behind that book , song, or movie.     In the library, in our little town, splits up the variations of the reading materials,music,and movies. There is a children's section, that has all the books we all grew up with, in half the building. Also an audult section for larger novels topics that teens and younger children would have no interest in or their parents would want them reading. Another great thing is that they have books for people in between, like myself, with teen books that spark our interest.      With the ideas that people are writing about today we can not possible control what comes to their mind. Some of the greatest books that are out are probably have the deepest meanings that some audiences don't prefere to listen to. But that is what is so great is that people have the liberty to go and find a book, or a magazine, or even @CAPS1 that they like.When freedom of what you read is taken away reader will stop reading. Doesn't the admisistrations of schools want kids to read to get their test scores up? If you take away what they like to read doesn't that mean they will stop reading? Also doesn't that mean the test scores will go down?     In my experience of topics that I have read about have been more grown up than my mother would like,but the fact of it is, is that people will read what they want. People don't like to be told no in my personal experience. Taking away topics that are well liked even with words or contents of what they are reading is not fair to the readers. I believe that they should not censor books, music, movies, magazines, etc. because that would mean the libraries would be gone",4,4
4076,"I don't think that censoring books and movies is needed in my opinion. Very many people are just too protective. They just need to calm themselves down and just face the facts. Eventually everybody will come in contact with almost everything that is mentioned in books at some point in there life. Life is unpredictable and anything can happen at any moment. You will probably end up reading the books that you are not supposed to anyway when you get older.      The people that think there should be censorship on library books will most likely get there way at least in their community. I think that libraries should be organized in a way that when you walk in you know the section you want to be in. They should have the books for adults in one section, books for teenagers in a different section, and books for kids in another section of the library too. This would help the parents that go with their kids keep them in the right spot. This would also help in a way to find your book if you know what type of book it is.      Another good thing that would help in a library are signs that catergorize the books. So if you walk in the teenager section and you are looking for a good mystery book. You just look at the top of the book case or at the ceiling where the signs are. This would help majorly for people that have never been in a library or don't know how to search for their book in a library.      The next thing would be to have all the movies, magazines, and music in the categories of adult, kids, and teenagers too. They would be in the sections of the books but at the same time be seperated to where the signs in the section say movie and music. This way kids don't have to roam around to find a certain movie that they want and have to roam around in the adult section to find it. The movies and magazines don't have to be exactly in the categories of mystery and things like that because normally movies are more well known than books in our time period.     A good thing that would keep little kids in the right section would be to color it with a lot of bright colors that will attract their attention. If a little kid goes into a section that is dull and boring they @MONTH1 just wander in the adult section and stumble across something that their parents don't want them to. The kids section could be lots of colors, the teenager section could be maybe one color, and the adult section could be the most dull of all of the colors.     All of my ideas would work and keep all of the kids entertained. They also will take more of an interest in reading if they are interested by walking in a library. These are the only ideas that I have that would work well. There could be more things that would keep kids interested but only for a little bit",3,4
3808,"I do not believe that books that are considered offensive should be removed from public libraries. I could understand if it was school libraries that were in question, because of the fact that some of the materials that these extremely explicit books contain is not for a child to be reading. I feel as if these certain materials can be helpful to seeeing other peoples point of views on certain subjects. Though books this material can be called offensive, to certain people this is there culture and how they live.    What would happen if every book that was considered offinsive was actually removed for book shelves? Some of the most interesting books that I have ever picked up have been controversial. The eye-opening world of these books is amazing. The fact that I can read about other peoples life, and their everyday struggle is astounding to me. If we all made a huge decision based off of one persons opinion, then our world would be a mess.     Therefore, if all of these 'offensive' books were to be removed, then what is left to read. I want to read something that is going to grab my attention, and make me want to keep reading. I do not think that i would have that type of experience if these books were removed.",3,3
3261,"The world today in the @LOCATION1 is hardly free. Everything that we see, hear, and read is censored. Is this good or bad? For the most part, it is good. Adults, teenagers, and young children all should only be allowed access to certain types of movies, music, books, magazines, radio stations, and so on.     I don't believe they should be removed, but I do believe these materials should have limited access. Some materials are kind of hard to keep from children and teenagers, but I believe what is kept from children is up to children's parents to say whether or not the children can watch, look at, or listen to what ever it @MONTH1 be that is concidered offensive to some people. Some materials are and should continue to be censored, but to an extent. If a person were to watch an @CAPS1-@CAPS2 movie or even unrated at a movie theater, that person would have to be @NUM1 years of age or older. That is the law, and I believe this is a good thing.      Parents should, also, definitely be the one's to censor what children watch, see, hear, or read. Children for the most part don't know any better. Children are curious little beings. If there is something that a parent has laying around the house that the child has never seen before that child will immediately wonder what this material is. If it were a magazine, they might look at it. I believe that there is a certain age to be allowed to look at these things, because there are a lot of materials in this world that are meant for adults only.    These materials have to be kept open to the public or else all the people who don't find these materials bad would be broke because people fight for what they believe in and that costs money, especially if the people want to take their opinion as to why they should be able to see or hear whatever they want to because they are an adult and they are mature enough to participate in these activities. The people who fight for what they believe in would need a lawyer. Lawyers have to be paid or else they will not work for you.     There are a lot of people around the world who know what they believe is good and bad. It's all in how these people being are raised, and were raised as a child themselves. If people believe something is bad, then they don't have to read, listen to, look at, or watch any of the things they find offensive. These activities are only for the people who do not have a problem with seeing or hearing these materials, therefore these materials should be censored, but only to a certain extent.     If everything in this world that even one person found offensive were removed, then, what about all of the other people who do not find those materials offensive? What about the adults who find no harm in seeing or hearing these things? Not every person in this world has the same opinion.     In conclusion, not everything should be censored. The materials children see and hear is up to parents. People will fight for their freedom to see and hear what they want because people know what they want and will get it any way they have to. This is @LOCATION2, let's not be overly strict about things.",4,4
3689,"NO, I do not think that books, music, magizines and etc. should be removed from the shelves if found offensive. Books help people in many ways. Music helps people find their activity in many ways. Also magizines helps people do things thats meant to be done.      The reason I said books help people is because it furthers one knowledge to understand things better. It also hepls one vocabulary more stronger than it once was. Last but not least it helps people become more focused and when saying that I mean that it makes you understand how to be focused on the main idea and the whole concept of the book. When people read and they don't understand what they are reading, they look further to try and understand the words they misunderstood which is good because you will learn alot more then you thought you did.      Music is also a very good thing to use because it make people calm when they have had an long stressful day at work, school, doctor, or etc. Music also helps you look into your creativity which means you want to do more things such as dance, sing, or some even start to paint. When im tired and I have had a long day , I like to go home and lay down and listen to music and that is because I feel relaxed and more calmer.      Last but not least, magizines. Magizines gives you alot of information that one @MONTH1 be seeking for. Just say that you were looking for a recipe and you don't have an computer and you have magizines, you can look and a magizine and see when was this recipe effective and by whom it was wrote. Also if you were to want to order some things such as shoes, clothes, perfume fragrances, lotions and some even order house hold things if needed. When I look in a magizine,I like to order shoes or even just compare the prices of something store bought or the magizine price. There are many different things you can look foward to when looking in a magizine. So take my advive and try it because sometimes what your'e looking for can be right in your library.      With all that being sad books, music, and magizines can be very helpful to you and any body else. Books are very helpful when it comes to essays or etc. Music is very useful when youv'e had a long day at your place of buisness or etc. Magizines are very self explanatory when it comes to food, clothing, shoes, topics , essays ,cars ,houses or etc. When you have a question or a concern or maybe even a doubt you can go to your nearest own personal library and borrow or read a book, magizine or listen to a little music. All  these things can be helpful and all you have to do is take in it and take advantage of free information that is given to you. All of these things can help you in a way",4,4
4709,"In my opinion everyone should have a right to go to the library and get whatever book, magazine, movie, and music they what. People go to the library for a lot of reason computers, books, etc. Also having a public library comes handy for people that don't have a computer at home. It's a public library you should be able to go there an find about anything you need book or movie wise.     Everyone has differnt likes an interests about their books or movies, and i'm sure people go to the library an expect them to have what they are looking for. Some people do go to the library an not find what there looking for. Then people get mad an upset cause they figured the library would have it an they don't. But yes I think that there should be any kind of magazine, movie, or book at the library that you need. I mean it's a library they should have it all.     Also people have the right to go get whatever book, or movie they want. It's called freedom everyone is diffrent and everyone likes diffrent things. There has been a few times I have went to our library to find books or movies an they didn't have them. You would think that a library would have a book or movie over trying to potty train a toddler, but they didn't.     I think that they should have any an every kind of book, magazine, an movie you want at the library. Yeah some people @MONTH1 take offense to it but who cares obviously they don't want it so leave it an go get what you want. Just cause you don't like it don't mean other people don't. So no I don't think just cause some people don't like them they should be removed from the shelves.     So no i absolutely do not think that any books, movies, magazines should be removed from the shevles. You are who  you are an you like what you like it shoudn't matter what other people think about it as long as it's what you like. So in my opinion the library should be a good use to everyone, and leave the books, magazines, etc. on the shevles for the people who do like to read or watch them",3,3
4425,"Katherine Paterson made a valid point in stating that some books are to offensive for some people to read, but that does not mean they they should not be read. Time and time throughout someone's life we hear things that we do not like nor want to be bothered with, but it is good that we do. Libraries should have to right to open all types of books to their shelves and not have them be censored by the public, this is why.      We, as people of the @CAPS1 have battled through hard times. @CAPS2, racistism, and extreme poverty or depression are just a few to recall. Having delt with those issues we alwaying tend to repeat them out of lack of knowledge. Slavery and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 were some of the @CAPS1's lowest moments and they were also very gruesome. Recalling those memeries is difficult but something that needs to be done; if books were to be cencored then many young adults would not be educated and could repeat such horrible actions.      Pertaning to movies, music and magzines the same laws applies. Though not in the same way, many times these publications are written about current news or social aspects of life. Music is a form a expression and everyone has their own taste. Not having to opition to chose froma variety of styles is wrong and unfair.  Music can not only be an expression feeling about love or angry but it can also teach life lesson's. Some artist like to sing or rap on their life journey. This can educate others in to knowing that if you do this then this is the result, good or bad. In a magzine they tend to lean towards more current topics such a politics, jobs, or young adults lifestyles. Movies apply to the same rights and topics. Each on is egualily as important and if a group of citizens feel that it is not then who are they to make that call.      What gives a group of people the right to say this is inapporicate and that you should not read it? They do not have it. In the constitution is states that you have freedom of speech and that means you can express it anyway you choose. By censoring what people read that is in a way taking away that author right to speak. Now, that is unfair.      Though Katherine Paterson made a vaild point in saying that some books are to offensive to read, she just simiply is not right. A library is supposed to be a place where people can find a book, music, movie, magazine of any genre  and read it. If matericals were cencored then that is unfair to someone else who does want to read it. Bottom line is that you have free will and you have to power to choose weather or not you want to read something",4,4
3128,"Books can be good things, but are they always good? They teach us things, entertain us, and are sometimes good pillows, but they can also be bad things. When a book is inappropriate for the reader, then it should not be on the shelves of the library. Music is the same way.     The library should absolutely take the book off the shelf if it is found offensive by someone. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive in religious ways. A person @MONTH1 believe in something very strongly, and then a book goes and makes fun of it or trashes it in some way. Some @MONTH1 say that the person just shouldn't read the book, but if it were me, I would want the book gone so it didn't remind me of what it had said everytime I walked by it.      Books @MONTH1 even be inappropriate for little kids. It @MONTH1 have language in it that the parents don't like. People have said that they should just make a section for those books to where little kids can't get to them, but you don't know what the childs parents are like. they could think a word is bad when you think it's fine. Everyone is different. Furthermore, a book @MONTH1 contain images not suitable for children. It comes back to what I was saying before, you can't just make a section for these books and say the heck with it. Libraries could even consider censoring some of their books.     Some religions believe that some types of music is the devils music. I know from experience that my mother thinks that scream-o is the devils music. She says that it is not right for them to sing like that and that @CAPS1 wouldn't like it. Other peoples parents @MONTH1 feel the same way.     Magazines @MONTH1 also have words or images in them that someone could take the wrong way. Although I don't believe libraries should remove them, but they should still watch who reads them. They could even put a little label on the front cover of the magazine that says it @MONTH1 not be suitable for everyone.     Books are usually good things, although they can be very bad. In the end, libraries should consider censoring their books, or if the book is bad enough and gets enough complaints, take it off the shelves completely",4,4
4540,"Throughout the history of literature, many books have been banned from public libraries and shelves. They are all somehow offensive to certain people, but not to all. Even some books that include magic and fiction have been expelled from some societies, simply because of certain religions and cultural backgrounds. I believe that there should never be a piece of literature completely banned from public eye.     When a book is banned, a piece of history is removed from others' sight. A book that @MONTH1 have been banned in the @DATE1 could not have been read by my mother or father. My future children and I could also never be able to read it. Materials that are removed from the public are generally removed because of one specific group which complains about its content.     When I was about eight years old, I remember seeing on the news that people in @LOCATION1 and other @CAPS1 @CAPS2 countries were burning books from the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series, only because it contained magic and ridiculous fiction. Maybe they were being burned because the @CAPS5 looked down upon its story and its fictional stories, but that does not mean it should be banned from the libraries. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series is one of the most popular pieces of literature of my generation, and generations after mine should be able to enjoy it as much as we did.     Before the beginning of @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10, the @CAPS11 were starting to be discriminated against. They were treated as sub-humans, like in this example. There was a night in @DATE2 called @CAPS12, when radical @CAPS13 and @CAPS14 supporters burned @CAPS11' houses, stores, and even books. Some of those books could have been the only copies, yet the @ORGANIZATION1 let their hate overcome them and destroyed the pieces of @CAPS16 literature. Because the @ORGANIZATION1 found the @CAPS16 work offensive, the generations after @CAPS8 @CAPS9 @CAPS10 can never read the books burned during @CAPS12.     In Katherine Paterson's quote, she says, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe she is correct in this quote. If literature keeps being censored, there will be none left for future generations to enjoy. No literature should be censored, not even the most radical, magical, or fictional. If censorship continues, the future of literature is doomed.",5,6
4555,"Books, music, movies, and magazines are all things people use for entertainment and study, something that everyone should have access too.      If someone is offended by one of these things i do not think that they should be removed off shelves or advertisements. Many people will still find these books or other recources interesting. If the source is something more adult then it should be placed in a section that is labeled or supported by information that says so.          Radio stations play songs that talk about sex, drugs and violence but i believe that kids need to be associated with these things. Parents can't keep their children from it all of there life, and most of the bad things said are cut out.     Everyone has a different interest in the things that he or she likes. So why should you pull something off the shelf in stores or libraries just because its offensive to one person",3,3
4357,"I don't think that certain materials in books, music, movies, and  magazines should be removed from shelves because I think that everyone has the right to say what they want to say, but I do think some things in books, movies, and music that might be appropriate for a high school student aren't appropriate for an elementary school student. Some things can be really offensive to elementary school students but not so much to high school students, it would just depend on what they are reading, watching, and hearing.      I've never experienced anything offensive in what i've read in any book before but I have experienced some in music i've heard. I didn't say really anything about it I just thought someone shouldn't have written this certain song that I was listening to and I didn't think it would really be that bad. It's mostly in rap music that i've heard that's really offensive and I think shouldn't have been even written. But I still think everyone has a right to say what it is that they are wanting to say",3,2
4392,"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? No. I strongly disagree. D     @CAPS1 you know that there is more than @CAPS5 radio station? Well, @CAPS3 you do. Not just @CAPS5 person should be able to talk for everyone. I enjoy every genre of music and books.  @CAPS4's pretty much my life. All I know is that when I get offended by a song, I change @CAPS4. When I'm reading a book I don't like, I put @CAPS4 down. @CAPS4's not your job to make my decisions. I live my own life and personally think you should live yours as well.     Books, movies, plays, games, magazines, all things of that sort are for our entertainment. If they began taking them off shelves because of vulgar things and things that offend people, then why do we have freedom of speech? Those people that are offended need to put whatever @CAPS4 is down and move on.  Just because a handful of people are offended by the everyday things that people use to stay amused, doesn't mean they need to be taken away.      Authors and directors spend months, even years making movies and writing books just to entertain us and feel accomplished. If they started taking them off our shelves and off the big screens, people would lose jobs. For example look at the @PERSON2 @ORGANIZATION1. That can easily offend a person, but those are brilliant pieces of work.      I am personally the kind of person that reads books that are suspenseful, books that keep me on the edge of my seat. People enjoy books that they can relate to, and some people can relate to those books that are 'offensive.' I, myself, have read a book that cinsisted of drugs and viloence that I related to and @CAPS4 helped me out, @CAPS4 made me realize its not always the right thing to do.      I think people need to realize that all those books, movies, magazines, and all the aboe that 'offend' them, are reality. No matter where you go, what you do, what you throw out, or what you keep in the house, your kids, parenst, friends, everyone will see @CAPS4 sometime in theirlives.      Viloence and drugs are seen everyday. Many more things that offend people are always going to be there. If all of those things are offensive to some people, then they need a reality check.  Books like that can influence kids to wanna go the rightdirection. They read a book or see a movie with a drug addict in prison and theyll think, '@CAPS2, I'm never going there.' @CAPS3, I can't say that goes for all kids in this world, but you get the jist of what I'm trying to say.     If @CAPS4's the parents that are worried about their kids getting into that kind of stuff, be my guest to remove @CAPS4 from your household, but not from everyone, not from the people who enjoy @CAPS4. I'm a strong believer that people know right from wrong, so why not just grow up a little bit and do what's right? Those books, movies, and magazines that are offensive, are enjoyable to me.      This makes me think of drama. People say they hate @CAPS4, but no matter what, @CAPS4's everywhere, and @CAPS4 will always be everywhere. If you can't get through life being offended every @CAPS3 and then, then how do you think you'll survuve. What do you think is in store for the next years to come?  You must learn to deal with @CAPS4.     Taking away all of these things, I think, is a mistake. If people are against @CAPS4, they need to worry about themselves and just leave @CAPS4 alone. They can make their own decisions, they don't have to pick up and @PERSON1 book when there is a @ORGANIZATION1 in their reach. That is what literature is about, writing. Do you honeslty think the author was worried about offending anyone? No, because the author or director whom wrote the book or made the movie, they knew what is was about and they know that not all of the world will see @CAPS4. Not all of the world will care to see @CAPS4. They know that people are smart enough to read the summary before they get'offended.'      @CAPS4 irritates me when people think they need to live for everyone. @CAPS4's like the saying, '@CAPS5 man's trash is another man's treasure.' You might not like @CAPS4, you might even hate @CAPS4. But once @CAPS4's out of your hands, the next person might come back and drastically fall in love with @CAPS4.     I think that just because someone picks up a book and @CAPS4 offends them, @CAPS4 doesn't mean they needed to whiped off the shelves. Grow up, put whatever @CAPS4 is that offends you down, and walk away.",5,4
3131,"Libraries are sometimes connotated as very boring. Walking up and down isles looking at all of the books, and wishing that they were all more interesting. Minutes after searching through the one shelf you have been rummaging through for what seems like hours, you get a glimpse of a very interesting title. Inside of this book could be countless inappropriate pictures and profanity on every page. Who is to blame for opening the book and reading it?     Profanity, nudity, and crude humor, as well as many other things, are all over the media, including books. Some parents try very hard to keep their children out of the way of those things by telling the child that they just simply cannot watch, listen to, or read certain things. The parents typically do not say why they are not letting their child see, hear, or read these things, other than, 'it is bad, and I said no.' If parents were to tell their child specifically why they were not supposed to be exposed to certain things, the child might not be so inclined to get involved in those things.     Not only should the parents teach their child why they should not be exposed to those things, but maybe they should be around when their kids have an opportunity to see things they shouldn't. And if a child is too young to see, hear, or read certain things, than they are far too young to be browsing a library or any other place where they are not properly guided by a parent.      Censorship, in my opinion, should not be done by libaries, movie producers, television programs, and record companies, it should be done by the parents of a child.",4,4
3019,"From many thoughts and arguments people disagree with the school libraries. The main reason is because of the books, magazines, ariticles, and internet that contains content very disturbing for children. Such content requires material as violence, drugs, and nudity. In this argument, parents do not like the fact that their kids have resources to uncensored content. Or perhaps the parents do not care about what their children have access to.        Today libraries are not focused on the materials that they have on their shelves. That is how children could get the idea in being a 'bad kid' in school. They think it is cool seeing someone else doing drugs, violence, or nudity. But if the libraries have censored content in the library, then kids would not enjoy it if they would have uncensored content. In the parents thoughts, uncensored content should be kept away from children.      The libraries should be more responsible with the content that they have on their shelves. They either do or do not know that they have offensive content in their library. They need to remove all offensive and uncensored content from their shelves for the children. It is not right for the kids to see any offensive or uncensored material.           Their are parents who have kids in school, who do not care about what they learn or what they do. Parents should be more concerned about what their kids are learning everyday. Then they can at least teach their childern about uncensored content.      Parents and libraries should be more responsible about the offensive content that the children could possibly have access to. Children should not see any of the content because it is not right for a child. The falt goes to the parents and the libraries. They should be aware of the material that the children are looking at",4,4
3826,"Knowledge @CAPS1     @CAPS2 you ever remove something that be misconstrued as offensive to someone, although you don't believe it is? Neither @CAPS2 I, and I dont believe libraries should either. Removing books, movies, magazines, and music from libraries is unconstitutional, and it seems to lean toward controling how people think, known as communism. Also anything can be found offensive by one party of people, and so everything @CAPS2 be offensive, and removed. Then libraries @CAPS2 cease to exist. What about in the court room? If one side of the story is not told, how will the jury be able to tell if the accused is guilty or innocent? Taking out certain 'offensive' learning materials @CAPS2 leave people in a bored mindless state of mind.     Do you want the government controling what you think? I didn't think so. In the @LOCATION1, modern day @LOCATION2, @PERSON1 did just that. He decided exactaly what went in and out of peoples minds. He did this by desiding what they could read, write, and listen to. That sounds like things you can get at the library, right? We can't have the government controling what we think, and mostly all libraries are government run. If we let them deside what we read and listen to, thats the first step in losing our freedom, and nobody wants to lose their freedom.     Lets say a white man goes into a library and looks at a book about racism, and how it has helped the nation. Then, at the same time, an @CAPS3 @CAPS4 women goes into the same library and gets a book on why women are better than men. Then they see each other, and the woman wants the mans book banned, and the man wants the womans book banned, and both the books are removed. Then neither party is happy, because both of their books are gone. The point is, anything can be found offensive, if you just glance at it, or look at it to much. Plus if everything can be found offensive, and all of the offencive materials get removed, then all the books and learning materials are gone. Noone is left happy.     If you are being tried for murdering someone, and the lawyer of the defendent gets to say their piece to makes it look like you are a murderer, and you don't get to defend yourself, what are you going to do? Your going to go to jail, most likly an innocent person, and your marked as a murderer the rest of your life, all because your side of the story wasn't heard. That is unjust, unfair, and unconstitutional. If we let this happen to our libraries, half the books will be sentinced to 'death,' without a 'fair trial.'     So, if you want to have an un-@CAPS4, communist, and unfair library system, that is your choice, but I believe that the way we do things now is just fine. No book should be banned because of its material, because noone, except the writer knows exactally what it means. People get to read what they want to read, and don't have to read what they don't want to read. Thats what the freedom we have is, you have a right to read, watch, and listen to whatever you want, and nobody can stop you. Do you want that to change? I know your awnser; it's a no",4,4
3694,"I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies etc. should not be removed if they are found offensive. The library has different sections for different groups like the yound @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 section, easy children or picture and @CAPS1.      Young @CAPS1 or the @CAPS2 section is for mainly the teens. They have books that a teen who normally read. The @CAPS2 section has music which teens listen to. For @CAPS4 they have the twlight soundtrack. This section does not have any explicit language.The teens who go into the library actually enjoy the select of books offered to them.It has everything most teens like to read about. There is nothing offensive in this section and it should not be removed.     There is also a childrens section called the easy or picture book section. This section are for the younger children. Children that are not in school or in the early stages of school. The books, music an movies in this section are cartoons an animals. Things that children would like to read, listen or watch about. For @CAPS4 this section has movies like strawberry shortcake, athur, even lilo and stitch. eveything in this section is made for children there is not one thing in this section where the child or parent who think is offensive.     The library has a section for adults. The @CAPS1 section is there to catch adults eye. It a separate fom the @CAPS2 and Children sections. It is located at the other end of the library. If there is an @CAPS1 who thinks that something is offensive they have the right to talk to someone who works at the library. Most adults do not have a problem with the items in thier section. The library keeps the adults section with things that adults would want to look for. It would not have something little children would want.      The entire library is split up into different sections. It is easy for the children to look at books for them and for adults to do the same. There are only a few that I named but every age group has a specific spot at the library. If there is something found offensive to the people I dont think it should be removed because it might just be in the wrong section. The library takes great precaution to the censorship of their books, movies music etc",3,4
3184,"Censorship should only be used for areas in which young children are exposed to, suchs as schools and tv shows intended for young children. Things that aren't intendend for young children should not be censored. If you were to censore everything because some people find it offensive then we would never be able to find new ideas to improve our community.     Censoring books, moives, magazines, and music that aren't intended for young people is a wast of time. If you were to take a book off a shelf that explaind the @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 because a person found it offensive then we would never make advansis in technology. Cenosoring items like books is just plane idiotic and ignorant. Studing matireal is our only way to advance in seiance, and if we can't get the right books to studie because they were taken off the shelf due to it being offensive then we will never make brakethoughs in technology.      Parents that feel that books, movies, and magazines should be censored really arent good parents. If they really were consurend with thouse topics then they shouldn't buy them the moives or the books that they find offensive. It seems that parents want to proclaim they want to censore that items because they find it offensive. But not all parents feel the same way, some parents are open with their children about these topics and feel that their chilren are mature enough to handle things like these.     As a child I wasn't shielded from these kinds of situations. I grew up with out censoreship. I wacthed movies and read book that were never censored, and I was mature enough to know what it all ment. I see why parents want to censore that kids from topics like thouse, but they never take the time to talk to their children about these topic and see if that are mature enough to hanld it.     Censoreship is great for childrens tv shows. But when you start to censore someones ideas because you find them offensive and wrong then you are being ignorant. People here have freedom of speech and desirve the right to not have there work censored because a small group finds it offensive. Censoreship is a great tool, if used right",3,3

But then some books are not offensive too everybody, so it would be unfair if all books were removed from libraries. I can relate too @CAPS2 discovering books that's not educational for them. It's up too the parents too show their @CAPS2 what too read and what not too read. This can also happen with movies, certain movies that @CAPS2 can and can't watch. The reason I say this is because if it was up too @CAPS2 on their own too decide what they would want too do, it would usually be negative results. Thats what parents are for.      I was young myself and I had experienced this too at one point. The type of movies I watched, I thought they were pretty cool, but I was too young too realize what I was watching and what I was trying too do from a movie. I had too learn from my parents that the things I were doing was not rational. Then I realize that I was making mistakes. It was nothing cool about it. friends had told me that as well. So i figured out the hard way. I don't want any @CAPS2 to experience that.      Not all parents can stop all @CAPS2 from discovering some disburbing things from books, music, magazines and all. What I'm trying too say that it can be reduced. Some parents can prevent it from happening. somethings can get in sink too a @CAPS2 brain and it could never be helped or solved. These things are serious and some people don't take it likely. And thats where it takes effect. Its up tookids parents or role models to show that some things are'nt meant for them too see until the right time.          I'm not telling parents to trap their @CAPS2 from the world. What I'm saying is that parents should let them know that their going to witness some things. They just have to be prepared too see them and hopefully it does'nt take a negative impact on them. Hopefully they would be smart enough too tell what's right from wrong. Its up too the parents to assist their @CAPS2. Its up too the @CAPS2 too know whats good for them.     I do believe that some @CAPS2 are capable of growing out of some events they learned from movies, too know that they were young, because I grew out of that myself. And if I can do it, so can they. Its not impossible. One good thing is that some @CAPS2 grow up in a positive community to know not read disturbing books/magazines, or watch disturbing movies.",3,3
4637,"censorship     No,i dont think they should take certin book off the shelves, there are alot of thing out there that can be found offensive; gangs, politics, race, even school that small children go to.      I can understand wanting to shelter your children, but you cant keep them from every thing. Inner cities have gangs that right awfal words on trains, building, and about anything they possible can. an you cant just take that off the shelf.     Politics can be the worst, during presidentual elections they are always bring up there color of skin, and about everything they can find out about the other person. All of your kids watch this on tv.     Race wars can get bad, people all around the world are fighting just because the color of there skin. You cant him them from it either, its an on going battle that will never be one and it will keep getting worse.     I cant speak for other schools but mine has a lot of little problems; little kids cussing, the older kids fighting, then there are the people that try to do good in school and get picked on for it.      You cant hide you kids for ever, sooner or later they will find out about these problems. If you want to help your kids keep them off the streets because reading it in a book is alot better than them seeing it in the real world. You have to prepare them for the problems ahead, and if you dont then they might  get hurt alot worse than the little words in a book or a magazines or movies.",3,3
3302,"I believe as a citizen of this city and as a avid library goer, that censorship in libraries is neccessary. Some of the material in the libraries @DATE1 are very graphic and sometimes quite a bit offensive. Do we really want our children looking at half-nude people or the murder of innocent people just because of their skin color?     In @DATE1's libraries there are many books and movies that represent racism. Take for instance the movie '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1.' In the movie the white children get yelled at because they are playing with the @CAPS3-@CAPS4 children. This is a wonderful example of why censorship is neccessary. Just think, if your child were to watch this and then go and say something rude to one of their friends, who is @CAPS3-@CAPS4, it would be very offensive to them. Although this movie is about historical events, it still needs to be taken off the shelves, in @CAPS1 opinion.     In @DATE1's society, nudity is becoming a big issue in movies and also in books. You @MONTH1 think that it is okay to let  your child watch a movie rated @NUM1, but little did you know, there is nudity in it. Depending on how old your child is, and if you let them on the computer or not, they might think it is okay to go and look up nude pictures on the internet.      Also, in books this is becoming an issue. It was just the other day I sat down to read a book about a musical that I wish to see, and there were nude pictures in it. Once I found this out, I asked @CAPS1 mother to please take it back. These are the sort of things that need to be taken off the shelves of our libraries.     Language usage in music is also a big deal. Many rap artists think it is okay to use offensive and explicit language in their music. I do not think they take into consideration that young children will be listening to their music. This genre of music needs to be taken off the shelves. You @MONTH1 think it is okay for your young child to listen to it now, but just wait until those words make it into their vocabulary.     I think that library censorship is a big deal that needs to be taken into deep consideration. It @MONTH1 be different at first, especially when you go in to get your favorite rap tape, or your favorite @NUM1 movie, but trust me in the long run, you will thank the library for taking it off the shelves. Especially when you get older and have children. You will not want them listening, reading, or watching the things you watched as a child",4,4
4096,"What is @CAPS1, @CAPS1 is whay made this country the who we are today! There are manny ways people can exspress them self in todays world, and it just so happens the art of writing acting and art are a huge part to the way people exspress them self. Because all of us are different and have our different veiws on the subjuct. Im not going to preach to you about what is right and what is wrong. im just going to share a few prior exspereances. Now all of theas were from being in a libraries. Some of them in smaller towns, others in the hart of a larger city. There is evean a story of a man and wife, in the suburbs of a larger city. It is also amazing to see what is exsepted in differeant parts of our country.      Well it all started when I was sitting at a small table in the back of the @LOCATION1 librarie. It was a small groupe of friends and we were all working on our reaserch papers. But we then saw a man and a woman, what I proseaved as husband and wife. They were looking at the magazines on the shelf directly infront of us. As he picked up a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazin she looked over to him and proclamed, that is so derogitory against woman. So he put it down and walked out. Wandering what was so bad about this magazin I walked over to the rack to see a woman standing in her underware with a classic car. About a mounth later I was walking in my local librare droping off some books for my mom. Instantly when opening the door I hear to people having a heated conversation about the painting they had hanging on the back wall, in the adult section. Wich was of a woman with her chest exsposed, now mind you this was not a modern painting it was rather old, with the paint slowly  pealing off. Now that painting was there for manny years with out any one saying any thing and that was the argument made by the head librarean. There were manny people standing in the area that this was taking place, and manny of them were not evean willing to hear what the woman had to say, because the painting turned out to be very famous and has been there since before some of the middle aged people in there could reamber.      As you can see there are manny differant veiws on what is exsepted in the modern time. Advertizement is all over and manny magazines use peoples bodys to draw people to their add, so they can try to sell their product. I belive there should be a line drawn when it comes to that kind of addvertzing. They @MONTH1 have to come to a agreement that each magazine should say if it contains the kind of adult content like that. if they were to make this a law they should have to put it right in the front cover so you know if you pic that magazine up, you are at risk of seeing things like that. altho when it comes to a painting of times before the @DATE1 and people had grown up in that same area for years and have been seeing this painting since they were yong too, I do not think that painting should have been taken off the wall. There is a fine line when it comes to the information being exseptible or not that is why I do belive there should be some kind of rating system whith the book and etc",3,3
4000,"Libraries have so many books, and books that talk about everything so what would be the point of having a book taken off the shelves. If people want to read something that is to bad I say let thim what is so rong with reading everyone needs to read maybe thats the only books some people like to read. So by taking thim books off isn't helpping anything. I think some of the bad books taken off the shelves are good just have bad things in thim, any book is a good book. If something is so bad it needs off the shelves there has to be a reason for it, the way I see it is that there as to be a really good part in that book that just loves to make people mad and you know what that is funny. People get mad at books that they dont want there kids to read, or there mad because that didnt come up with that idea. If you dont want ur kids to read it tell thim not to let the older people that dont care have a good time reading. Most people like to read about mested up things.           Music and Movies are a different story. Bad movies shouldent be put out for everyone to see movies arnt the same as books because a kid could get a bad book and not now have of the bad stuff means. But movies show you how bad things are shown. Music can also teach you how to do bad things by doing the same thing they did to make thim look cool. But I still think you should be able to have what you want to pick and if you have kids you are a boss to thim you can tell thim not to get anything bad",2,3
3109,"Katherine Paterson stated this quote, ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf,' @CAPS1 I agree . I feel that some of the books we have in our @ORGANIZATION1 libraries today just shouldn't be there. Offensive books, music, movies, and magazines can give  students and young children the wrong impact on life or their envoirment around them.     Now days, what children see is sometime what they do, so if books, music, movies, and magazines give them the idea that what they say or do is cool, then kids will most likely do it. @CAPS2 observation when i look at kids  in @CAPS2 community playing  is that they follow one another . When their playing tag and hide an go seek , So movies, books , music, and magazines play a big part on the way they behave.     @CAPS2 own experience with offensive books would be, there are books that are made by @PERSON3. In these books they use curel language, use wonmen bodyparts as symbols and many more rude things. @CAPS2 little sister came across one of these books, when she ask me about it was hard for me to explain to her that this was no book for a child her age to be reading, So the best way for me to put it was that it was an adult book. For her to get any images out of her head that I felt she shound't have.     Another experience I've saw was with @CAPS2 little cousin @PERSON2. He was looking at a magazine out of @ORGANIZATION1 library. The magazine was offensive to wonmen. It was a play boy bunny magazine. Now I don't know if you ever heard of these magazine , but I think it is very wrong that they use wonmen bodys for men to view . I also feel that  those type of magazines should not be in a @ORGANIZATION1 library. I believe it gives children, mainly  young men the wrong thoughts about wonmen.     @CAPS2 overall thoughts on censorship in libraries, is that not eveyone is going to feel the same way I do . There are parents that allow their children to read, listen , and watch whatever they want. I'm here to say i don't feel that is the way to go about things , because it can influence your children to do inappropriate things . I hope you take with you, @CAPS2 personal experience with you and help you children read , listen , and watch age appropriate books , music , moives , and magazines",3,3
4331,"I have seen some turely a offensive books on the sheilf of libraries. Book that make you worry about what would happen if a child @NUM1, @NUM2, or @NUM3 looked at thes books since that is where their mind absorbs the most knowledge but what if this knowledge was offensive to a race of people or a persons religion. This childern are the furter of are species. This should be censored in libraries.     Tried to a imagine if they had looked at books writen @CAPS1 and other nazi members during nazi @CAPS2 rule. Mabey they looked at a book by @PERSON1 or other famours killers. If they saw photo book about the massive jew death camps in europe. Movies that show war torn battle such as @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2, world war @NUM4, or world war @NUM5. The famours movie 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4' a movie based on the crulty of the @ORGANIZATION1 and the @CAPS5.     This is my view on censorship to protect childern from the a offensive things in or on books, music, movies, magasines. Their should be censored in all things childern can get in to. Imagine the world where the was no corntal media what they could put on",3,2
3934,"'@CAPS1 Books, Movies, Music, and Magazines?'          @CAPS2 do people take @CAPS1 books? Some people believe books, movies, music, and magazines should be sensored or 'band'. Why do people believe this should happen? Well there will be three topics that will be talked about in this eassy. The three topics are children, @CAPS4, and religion.          First, '@CAPS3'. Many parents themselves don't want there child to be exposed to viloence, volgure language, or even possible drugs. Viloence is one of the main problems to do with all four of these types of entertainment. Influencing there child could cause a loss by doing things as far known as stupidty. Another is volgure language, to adults for a generation above us, they take it as being disrespectful. News wide to this very day deals with drugs and teens getting more into them, causing an overdose that could lead to death.          Second, '@CAPS4'. Many people going from black to whites to eveyone around the world with different colored skin or more different type of features as one another. Here starts racsism, meaning against ones color or there ethics. Now to this day it has been calmed down but there was a time that certain words labeled certian people showing that they were less than others. Leading this to riots and gang viloents to earning respect. They want to be treated as an equal not less than others that which our ancentors did them in the past.          Third, '@CAPS5'. Religion is pretty big in the world and shows alot about the past and what certain people believe in. Religion is shown in these four types of form in these objects. Everyone believes theres is the right way and someone elses is the wrong. They cause conflicts in between one an another. So trying to keep them from bein banned isn't going to help for religion matters, because people do talk and some people out there want to change certain people to believe what they think is right.          So back to @CAPS2 would everyone or some take to @CAPS1 books, movies, music, magazines? Well it's going to be exposed sooner or later. Options are let it happen now or let it happen later. The sooner could be better or for the worst. Either matters just let happen what happens, someone will learn from there experience so why banned now?",4,4
3280,"Today I am going to talk about certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines. Should they be removed from the shelf if they are found offensive? In todays world it is hard to please every living soul. Every one is going to disagree about something in there life time.      Life as we know it, everybody lives it a different way, and in a different place, but everybody has read a book, listened to music, and even read a magazine a time or to. People @MONTH1 interpride it different than others. Therefore I personally dont think they should take articules out of the library that you can learn something from, unless it's something like pornograh then they should deffently take it out.     My conclusion is that you cant please everybody. I think that you shouln't take things out of the library that can help a student learn.",3,3
4073,"I do not believe that people should be given the right to do that.  Just like Katherine Paterson had said, if people did away with everything that offended them, there would not be any books left for any of us.  Everyone has the choice whether they either want to read the book, or they do not.  If they do not want to, then they do not have to.  Just because one person does not like something does not mean that everybody else cannot either.       Honestly, there are some people who take offense to everything, and if they do not like the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be, they do not have to read it.  I find a lot of people to say things that offend me, but that does not mean that I have the right to make them stop talking.     However, I do agree that there should be certain standards set for some of the books out there.  Some books are too graphic for young children to read, and I think that one should have to be a certain age to be able to read them.  But, I do not think that just because they are graphic that they should be taken off the shelves.       Maybe the book gets a very delicate point across, like the book '@CAPS1', for example.  In this book, a young girl is raped very harshly.  But, the author did not write the book to tell everyone about her experience.  She wrote the book to explain that no matter what happens, there is always something that can help.  This book was a success story, and the graphic detail is there to show the agony the girl had went through.  Some might find this offensive, but most think that it is uplifting to know that they are not the only ones who have had it happen to them.     Books are not the only things that might offend some people.  In certain department stores, there @MONTH1 be a movie that has a line in it that I take offensively.  Does that give me the right to take it off of the shelf and demand that it be banned?  No, and why might that be?  Because I have a choice if I want to watch it or not.     Another place is the @CAPS2.  If you ask me, there are a lot more offensive things on the @CAPS2 then there are in books.  Kids can get on the @CAPS2 and stumble across things that they definitely should not see, so does that mean we should ban the @CAPS2?  No, because the @CAPS2 helps in a lot of ways too.  If I wanted to, I could find offense in everything that is in a library.  Books based on religion, or maybe a website based on a musician that had references to drugs in their lyrics.  I would be mad if I came to the library to listen to music and someone had removed them from the computer.  Maybe I do not like what they're listening to, but that does not mean I can do anything about it.         So, my opinion is that books, or anything else for that matter, should not be banned because someone didn't like what it contained.  Not everyone is going to like the same book, and that's why there is such a variety to choose from.  Libraries should not be told which books they can and cannot lend out.  After all, we are not forced to do anything.  All of us are different and we like different things, but we should accept the tastes of others as well as our own",4,4
3405,"We see them. We read them. We gossip about them. Books that are found with inapropriate language, pages with the word 'sex' on them, disturbing thoughts and ideas, cuss words, its all there, but yet they are still in our libraries. My views on censorship is that, yes, our libraries should be more modest and not have books on the shelves with these things in them. The  books in libraries across the @LOCATION1 that have found and profane ideas in them, is one of the direct faults in our teenagers today.     In my personal experience with this, i have come across books that have had inapropriate language in them. I have also read books assigned to me at school that have had descriptions of sex and bad language in them as a third grader. As a young boy, I would go home to my parents and show them the content of the book and how despiteful it was. I've always been raised in a @CAPS1 home and seeing these things not only in schools, but on the bookshelves in libraries I believe is un-called for. I know that there are so many things that could offend people. Rascism, sex, cussing, rules, religion, but you need to eliminate the main things. It is impossible to please everyone. These ideas in magazines, books, in movies, and even in music has changed the world upside down. Even when I was young, we were taught no cussing aloud, and yet you see this all the time in books.     In @LOCATION2, of course we have the freedom to do what we want. Authors have the right to put profane language in their books, and even dirty ideas. However, libraries are not forced to keep this content in their libraries across the globe. I believe that we should keep the future of @LOCATION2 in the back of our minds, that if we teach them this material, they are going to grow up in the world with no morals at all, and the world will become worse than it already is.      In the quote by Katherine Paterson, I believe that she has made a strong point. If we take the books off of shelves, then our students, children, grandchildren won't be taught properly, and then there would be no education at all. However, I believe that from this quote even she agrees we in @LOCATION2 fear what our children read. So yet, why do we keep these books in our libraries? I believe that if we take these certain books, magazines, movies, songs, and internet sites off the computers, and out of libraries and schools, teenagers wouldn't be traveling down the road they are.     Today, the world has turned to a disaster. The kids we saw @NUM1 years ago were on the right path. Now those same kids are smoking pot, having sex, getting girls pregnant, abortions, miscarriages, things that are not appropriate. And I truly believe that this content students read in schools and libraries across @LOCATION2 has something to do with it all. It is now in the hands of the @LOCATION3, whether our kids grow up to be the future of @LOCATION2, or the joke of @LOCATION2. We need this fixed",3,3
3207,"Should certain books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are found to be offensive. Books, movies, magazines, music are made to relay a message, express a point of veiw, or to perhaps state an oppionion, of which everyone has a different point of veiw.     No, books, movies, magazines, music, etc., should not be simply taken off of the shelves or out of stores. All of the previously listed things are rated. Movies are rated @CAPS1 through @CAPS2, books are rated child through adult, and music if explicit has a parental advisery sticker, so just follow the ratings. IF a four-year old tried to buy two tickets to see a rated @CAPS2 movie the theater would not sell him the tickets because he is not yet off age. People @MONTH1 bring the point of maybe a child picks up a adult book or magazine in a store and begins to look at it and read it. The solution to that problem is simple create a seperate room in stores that sell these items and label the room adult section. Have cameras near by so if a yongster feels brave enough to tempt fate they will be caught or just put a desk out front of the adult section and require an i.d. for entrance. These are still books which are expressions of a persons dreams, hope, desires, fantasies, and heart, they should not be denied there dream because a person deems it unfit. And most apparent if it offends you dont read it.     Simply follow the rating rules. Take necesary precations. If all of these rules are followed then buisnesses and libraries should have no probles keeping everybody safe and happy.",3,3
3698,"In @DATE1, there are many rap/hip-hop artists. They all sing about gangs, narcotics, alcohol, and using women for favors. @DATE1 is something that our children should not be exposed to at such a young age. There are children that know the words to alot of the rap songs out there. The parenting skills of some parents also reflect on if the children learn the words or not.     I understand that children have to be exposed to some things in life. There are other genres of music that deal with all of the things i listed above. I dont think that it is right though for young children to learn about these things. How would you feel if your child came up to you asking what drugs are ? Or what alcohol is? I also understand that we should let our kids get a little taste of the real world to see what it is like for themselves but that can only go to a certain extent. After that extent, the kids would be learning too much at such a young age.     In my personal opinion, we could let our children listen to an edited version of the songs or even chose a different genre that doesnt use those such topcis as much. Country music for example is very peaceful to me. I suggest that people listen to it because it is very realistic in ways. I also understand that rap music can be realistic in ways too. Everyone has a different outlook on what kind of music children should be allowed to listne to. I will sometimes listen to rap music but i would never allow my kids to listen to the uncensored version.     Magazines also have alot to do with why children are so 'street' smart these days. Magazines can put false information out so people will believe it. Magazine companies put revealing pictures of people on the front cover to catch someones attention. It works most of the time and children also see that. They are young and nieve so they will do what they see someone else do. That includes looking at the magazines with good looking men or women on them.     Another subject is the movies that are coming out in @DATE1 world. Movies can reveal whatever they want. Normally the movies that are inappropiate for children are rated @ORGANIZATION1 will find a way to see @DATE1 stuff. A child could be on the internet and something accidentally pops up. All of the advertisements on the side of the computer screen are viruses just waiting for children to click on it unintentionally.     These are my strong opinions on what we should do with todays society. We need to try and watch what our children are listening to and watching. I know that we cant watch their every move but we can do our best to watch what they are doing when they are in close watch. Thank you for your time!",4,4
4405,"Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The material should be removed if they offend their gender. Also, the material should be removed if it offend's their religion. Finally, it should be removed if it offend's their race.     The material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's gender. First, the material can make a person feel unworthy. Second, the material can cause an large altercation between the author and the person who is being offended and maybe others. Third, the material can also harm someone by them picking up the book and reading the text.     Also, the material should be removed if it is offensive to anyone's religion. This can cause someone to hate every other person with the same religion as the writer, song writer, actor, and/or director. Second, the library should be about education, fun, and interesting contents not by offending someones religion. Finally, this can cause a person or people to act as terrostist from this offensive content.     The material also should be removed if it is offending someones race. First, the material @MONTH1 call the race of the person that is reading, listening or watching a name that's very offensive name( not directly but in general). Second the material can speak of the race as if was bad. Last, the material can influence other kids to disrespect that race and not like people of that race.

4064,"Nowadays, children can look on the shelves of libraries and find any type of reading you can imagine. Some magazines, books, and movies that are age appropriate. Children can also reach up on those same shelves and find some very inappropriate magazines, books, and movies. Should we remove these inappropriate items? Can we somehow get kids to not see them? Children are very curious. They want to know about everything and they will ask as many questions as they can. When they see inappropriate items on library shelves, what do we do?     Libraries shouldn't get rid of items that @MONTH1 be inappropriate for children. Instead, there should be a rating system on the books and magazines. Movies have ratings so children don't see things that are inappropriate; books should have those ratings too. If someone wants to check out something that isn't suitable for kids, then they can show the libraian their @CAPS1. Everybody can check out what is appropriate for their age. Libraries could even put all of the most inappropriate items in a separate section of the library. It could be a section that kids could not enter. Parents should also watch their kids to make sure they aren't getting into anything inappropriate.     The only censorship they should put into libraries is rating the items by maturity. Children can look onto the shelves, but we should put labels on what they can and can't check out. Parents could look out for what their children are trying to read. I believe that's the most we can do.",3,3
3078,"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc ...,should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?   Most of the people made books that are inapropiate or offensive and sometimes are the life of the person or some experience that they have live. But the problem is that a lot of people are not realistic and they don't thing that those is the live of person's and can be the future of more people.Peple sometimes like to be the best and can make problems with other and that mekes them happy that is a sad thing because that's bad and also they can get of the point of do things so bad that they go to jail that's are some of the experiences that people shows  but others get it wrong. well thats their problem they can do what ever they whant .  I know that live is not easy but thank's of that material we can have a better live and also we can deffence ourselves.  Also i don't think that they  need to be remove that books or magazines because that's what help us to have e better life and also in the future, they need to be in there and if people found them offensive just don't go there or don't see that materials ignore them more people like those and thinkthat are helpful for them and for me.   I don't think that they goin to have a bad material in there, things that are inapropiate i thing that they can't have bad or  nasty information in a place that a lot of people go and not only adult also childre's  go too. And that's is more inappropriatefor kids. People know what's going on in there and some others persons know too. the world sometimes is a danger and sometimes help us for grows up that's is a good thing but we hace the choise if we want to read or have that information.  I remember one time when i read a book that is kind of sad but that help me to know better our life it was about two boys the book has a lot of bad words and talk really bad bad olso that explain more the book and we learn more about it. that's some things that help us with life. One of the books, magazines,music,movies .etc  that we can write is our life because we pass a lot of difficults times and that is a book of our life and can be a inappropriate book of our live.people like me give the tanks to those peoples that publish they experiences and at the same time help us",3,2
3404,"Censorship in Libraries     In our libraries there are a lot of books that are very helpful. There are also a lot of magazines, music, and movies. A lot of the movies are adult movies ,but they do have a kid section at a lot of the libraries. Most of the books, magazines, and movies are all reachable by little children. I have been to the library as a child and seen all the books there.     When I went to the library as a kid, I went with my parents. We would go there and mainly go to the kids section. I can also remember going with my grandparents. I would read books or I would put a puzzle together or something. I cannot remember a time when I went to the library and seen something that was offensive.     I've never been to the library and seen anything that seems offensive to me. I'm sure that there is a book or a movie somewhere in every library is offensive, but to give you an example of a personal experience is something that I cannot do. If the libraries do have books that are offensive, they do a good job hiding them from me and other kids. I havn't heard anything about people finding these kind of books in other books or magazines that I read.     I tend to not read very many books about the world. I like to read biographys about sports players and types of books like that. Whenever I read magazines usually they are about sports or cars, so I don't read much about offensive things that are going on, if they are.      If the libraries have offensive books, but no kids or people that shouldn't be reading them, than the library doesn't need to remove them from the shelves. Some adult @MONTH1 come into the library looking for one of these books, so then they can ask and find them. So in my opinion, I think that the libraries shouldn't have to remove these books from the shelves.",4,4
4025,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from @PERSON1 voices a strong point on citizenship. Censorship happens everywhere you are. Whether its a book, a magazine article, or even a tv show things are censored. Censoring things doesn'@CAPS7 make anything more enjoyable, but infact makes less things enjoyable.     I think that things that are offensive should niot be removed from the shelf. Censorship diasble the viewer and or reader to be able to enjoy the full potential of things. I myself watch tv shows all of the time. When the censor things it makes me angry. I already know what the words are so why censor it. @PERSON2 wrote a famous book called @ORGANIZATION1. and that books has been banned from being taught in schools simply because it says a racial term. I have two things to say about it. One if it offends you then you shouldn'@CAPS7 watch or read it. Second one would have to consider the time and age that the book has taken place and that was language used back then. So then one could take in thoght when the book was written, what was the time of when the book had taken place, ect.     There are two books that I read called the @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 @NUM1. Both books have one thing in common. The use of censorship in their society. In @CAPS3 @NUM1 books are censored. @CAPS1 causes one to challenge that concept because he and others felt that it wasn'@CAPS7 fair for books to be banned. Also in the @CAPS2 a boy challenges his @CAPS6 society because they too censored certain things. Censorship also happens in todays' media. Some example are @CAPS7.V shows. TV censors vulgar language, and sometimes violence and gore. Now its understandable to censor childrens shows but shows for mature audiences are unacceptable. Considering the freedom of speech one can express. Also mature shows are only ment for mature people to watch them so why censor them?     Katherine Paterson makes a valid point in her quote. I feel that if you find something to be offensive then don'@CAPS7 read or watch it. If you feel that something is so offensive to you that you have to compell otheras in to believings what you think then you are wrong. People should have the right to read, watch, or listen to anything they want uncensored.",4,4
3464,"Do people have the right to limit freedom? Do people have the right to limit imagination? Do people have the right to limit self expression? Many people in today's world think so. Book  censorship is a big deal in the world today. Weather books deemed 'offensive' should be taken out of libraries or not is a serious issue. Censoring books not only limits self expression but it also limits knowledge and our constitutional right of free speech.     I believe people should not be able to censor books. Censoring a book is like putting a limit on human imagination. All through life people are urged to think outside of the box. We are told as kids that being unique and diffrent is a good thing. We are all told this and yet when writers express themselfs in books, the same people that told them to think outside of the box, want to censor their thoughts. By censoring books, we are telling the world that imagination is a bad thing.     Many people want to censor books so their children can not read 'offensive' matterial. They feel that by taking books they feel to be 'offensive' out of libraries, they can sheild their child from the bad things in the world. This is not the case. People @MONTH1 be able to censor books, but no one can censor life. Children will learn 'offensive' things with or without  books.      Book censorship limits knowledge. At the time it was written, The @CAPS1's of @PERSON1, was a very scandels book. Because of the laungauge this book used, many people thought it was trash. Many people wanted it to be censored. Today The @CAPS1's of @ORGANIZATION1 is a famous and classic book. In fact, I was required to read it for school. Regardless of the language this book used, it shows a part of @CAPS3 history. And to think, if people back then would have removed it form the libraries, I most likely would never have read this book, and I would never have the knowledge I gained from reading this book.     It is our constitutional right to write and read the books we choose. America was built on the idea of freedom. Under the constitution we are garentied freedom of speech. By taking books out of libraries, we are limiting our freedom of speech. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't read a book you want to read. No one should be alowed to tell you that you can't write a book as you want to write it. If we start censoring books, writers will be forced to censor their personal thoughts. Making writers do that, limits thier freedom of speech. If freedom of speech is limited, what other freedoms will also be limited with the years to come?     Book censorship and censorship in gernal, is not a good thing; all it does is limit things. If we start censoring books, we are giving a messege to our children, that diffrent is bad. If freedom of speech is limited, how long will it be untill our other rights are limited? Where will it end? Before removing even the first book from the shelf, we need to ask ourselvees this, do we have the right to limit freedom",4,4
3177,"The way i see it movies or books shouldnt be taken off the shelf .becouse it should be up to ower own right to take a movie or to tonot take the movie .Also music such as country or sad music ant like movies or books how can u take music of the radio u canot do it .Becouse it dnt matter what u do with the radio shut it off turn it down or change the chanel with the way the world is now days there will all ways be things on the radio that u wont wanna hear and there will be things that u do wanna hear ,thats my opinion about movies and music      Also if there was any way to keep movies away i would probaly have it done there are goood movies and there are bad but one movie that is afensive and shy is (shylo) about the old man hittin the dog and stuff thats verry afensive to some one that was raised around beetings.",1,2
4313,"I think that we should remove certain things like movies, music and books should definitely be a debate because in these days people are doing things that they never done before.     For an example music, music is a great cause of things that people motivate to do things and get really into the songs. They try to do the same things as what there favorite artist or actor does. I hear some songs and they talk about illegal things and I look around the world I hear children talking about those things and they tell there parents what is that ? But they just dont want to tell them the truth but once these kids get older they will know what it is and it will be there choice if they want to follow that path or think about something else. But about the people who are singing this, they're putting it in a way that is not bad you could do this all the time and enjoy it with out getting introuble and in reality these kids are blind and dont know what there getting them selves into.     Also, many books have offensive language that kids read all the time but people dont even notice. That's how kids could get introuble in school because they learn a new word in some book they never read or cant even read cause there to young to understand but they do it anyways beacause of curiosity, they dont know what there doing. Thats a way how a child becomes bad cause person when he or she becomes older cause they learned things that they shouldnt have learned. I think that we as a good country should make sections into what people can read and cant read, and it should depend how old is the person.     Some school librarys, have movies that kids could watch and it could be if your a elementry school, middle school etc. But some of these movies have offensive language and some appropriate scenes, that kids would want and learn how to do those type of things. Or how they see the actors in the movie and they curse and they think is cool cause there doing it as well. I think that elementry students should watch only pg movies, middle school pg @NUM1 and down, and for the high school, we should be able to see basically any movie, but in the same time I think most of the high school students have to be more mature, thats probably why we still dont have the priblige to see any movie cause peolpe dont know how to handle them selves.     Finally, I really think they should minimum some movies, music and books cause kids are learning things they shouldnt be learning until they get older, and that those three things change the world in so many diffrent ways, some are good but most of them are bad, these are my opinions.",3,4
3197,"I don't think censorship is right for our public libraries.   In my opinion, it depends on what they are saying or what they are showing. Also, it depends on what what the ages the kids are or adults. People are different in many ways. It also depends on the way they take it in their signifaction.     If they move books, music, movies, and magazines off the shelves because their offensive that wouldn't be a very good idea because how would other people get ahold of it and want to read it in life, if they get taken off the shelves? Some people enjoy actually reading that stuff and nothing else. I just don't think that people would be to happy. Also, they're different cultures in these countries that read stuff like that.      People would like to learn about different things. If people took the books and other things like that off the shelves, there would be hardly anything to read. Childrens and up to adult books has all different kinds of things. The books and things like that you can read can have more things in it besides offensive things, sometimes they can have more information in those books than others.      In my conclusion, censorship is not good in our public libraries because it taking basic things out of the libraries and taking half of the reading from people.",3,4
3599,"Have you ever imagine goin to the libary and getting a magazine from the shelve and you find it offensive and you cant do anything about it? Well now you can say what ever you want because Katherine Paterson and me when to a libary together we pick out magazine from the shelve and it had alot of offensive stuffs we did not like. We went to the lady infront and she dint even knew this magazines where there.  She got really mad and when back to the shelve and there where alot of magazines with offensive ritting, pictures and even comments. We got all of the magazined anf threw them away. In my own opin i think these kind of things thar are offensive like movies, music, and magazines should be remove.     They should be remove because it a bad influence to the younth, and it gives them a picture in there head and they do it later or maybe say it to the plubic or even so it in there homes. They should be remove because its getting alot of people in to trouble and making them do what they see of it, this is getting to kids and they becoming more violent to there school, friends and even moms. We have to remove all of these offensive stuffs becasue we see these every where and its easy to find like in the movies it getting to the piont where you see naked girls in every movie. The parents have to do something about it to because they are the one who are buying them and then leaving it every where in the house and its easy for the children to find it.     We have to be more care full about what we but or what we read because you can find it offensive and then your kids @MONTH1 read it and they would think another thing. So next time you buy or go some where and you find some thing offensive talk to the manager or the supervacer about taking it off. That why i think they should be remove",3,3
4399,"There are certain books that no child should ever read but in some libraries they don't care whats on there shelf. They don't care if a little kid starts reading a book full of cusswords and other profanity. As long as hes reading thats all that matters to them. Even though in libraries there are kid sections that doesn't mean he can't walk over and grab an @CAPS1 book or what ever he can get his hands on.     When I was little I was always in the library and it was never hard to get a book with bad language. We even thought it was funny when ever the book had cursewords in it cause we would just repeat. I remember in school even books the teacher would read to us had cursewords and we would all laugh at it, even the teacher thought it was funny. But if we ever repeated that word while not reading it we would get sent down to the office. Even though we thought it was ok to say just because we read it out of a book.     I do agree that books with bad language should never be on the shelf to where a kid can grab it. I think its fine to have cursewords in books when there in junior high but elementary school is to early. Those books are meant for adults only cause some books sound better with cursewords in them. My parents thought it was wrong when I would bring home a book from the library and it would be full of cursewords or slang. But they would never say anything to the library cause they know that I will be hearing these words all the time when I get older. Those are all the reasons why I think books with curse words should not be handed out to little kids.",3,3
3381,"I do not think that books should be taken off shelves just because it's offensive or because others don't like it. If everyone took the books, music, and movies off the shelves that they didn't like, then all that would be left would be empty bookshelves.     I believe that the library was a right to keep whatever they want on the shelves. Some @MONTH1 say that the library has inapproprite books to check out, or they don't want their kids to pick up a book they don't like and read it. I think that's why the library has the shelves marked in sections for example, adult, young adult, children, and referance.      I've never seen a book that was offensive to me in a libray, which brings me to another point. Everyone has a opinion, if a book is offensive to you it might not be offensive to someone else. For example say that you saw a book on animal mating and you thought it was a bad book for the libary to have because, little kids might pick it up. Well that is your opinion because, if a biology teacher seen a book like that then they might want to check it out.      Another thing is that the library has certain book for a reason. Say that there is a book in the library that is about slaves, this book might be offensive to @CAPS1 @CAPS2 but, this book is there to inform people about slavery. What is offensive to some isn't offensive to others.     In conclusion, I believe that books should not be taken off library shelves just because it is offensive to you. Everyone just has to remember that people have their own opinions about things and you just have to deal with it. That's why I think that books should not be tooken off shelves",3,4
3672,"There are so many things these days that people find offending, in so many different places in magazins, books, movies, cell phones, on the internet,even some words in songs. Some people find it so offending that they think they should be able to remove these offending materials off the self.      A big thing for parents in this situation is what if my child gets ahold of this? I dont want them reading this! What if it messes up their childhood? Honestly parents if you dont want your young child to read these things or see these pictures then why take them too these places where it is at? On the occasion that they do get ahold of it, then sit down with them and talk to them about it so they understand that its something they should not be ossiated with.     Also if  evryone took things off the self what they found unoppropiate then we wouldent have anything left to read, listen to, or watch. Alot of times one thing that someone finds funny could offend another person to no end. For example @PERSON1 could find something very enjoyable, but @PERSON2 could find the very same the extreamly offending. It would lead to many arguments amoung or communites.     Yet there is still another reason that this would not work out well, and would not be a good idea. If this were to happen then kids would grow up thinking that this is a esay world. This world is harsh and not easy at all times. Kids learn alot of this through the media. As long as we have postive role modles to exsplain to kids that what they see in some of the media is wrong, and they should not take part in it, then why would it need to be removed?      If people were able to do this then the communities would have alot more crime from anger, we would have nothing left to read watch or see, and kids would live a very confused life not knowing what to exspect from the media. So now i ask you, what do you think",3,3
3548,"Do I believe that vertain materials should be removed from the shelves of libraries if found offensive? I believe that all types of materials should be placed in libraries to satisfy the different styles of what people like. Censorship should not play a role because everyone has their own opinions on what is looked at as offensive and what is not. By giving everyone the freedom to enjoy what they like will make alot of people happier.      The wants and needs of people varie from one extreme to the other. What one person loves, another @MONTH1 hate. This should not play a role in whether or not materials should be removed from public places such as a library. Everyone has the right to express themselves through art in their own way. Taking away the art that some find offensive would not be fair to those who enjoy it. By doing this, not all people will be satisfied when not everyone gets what they want.     Censorship should not take part in any library. Entertainment can not always please everyone. It will be judged in many ways no matter what anyone has to say, so the problem should just be left alone. Arguing to take away the material that some like will only cause tension to rise and make matters worse. It is understandable, for example, that a parent would not want their child to be able to be welcomed into the media world where not everything has postive influences. That's life though and not everyone has th same outlook on it. You have to think of others, and respect their view of it all as well.     Opinons will vary with what I have had to say. I strongly believe that people should be given the right to enjoy the materials they take an interest in. Censorship definitely has its positives and negatives, but for the most part it is wrong and should not have a role in any library. Cutting down people's availability to their interests will only lead to frustration. You can not please everyone, so in that case, censorship will just have to be looked beyond.",3,3
3903,"Do you think @CAPS1 is going to prevent people from getting offended? Taking items such as a books, music, movies, magazines, ect., will not stop people from getting offended. The @CAPS2 question's are who decides what is offensive, and how is it offensive? What makes something offensive",2,2
4077,"To remove or not to remove     Should people be able to remove books that are offensive? I think so;it would help our kids and young adults, to read more educational books, rather than magazines and comics.     To start off with everyone has their own opinion of what is offensive ,and whats not. personally I don't think that we should remove books, because their offensive; I think we should just not let that perticular person not put out anymore books. But it's like I said everyone has their own opinion.     Secondly it's entirely up to the library where to place certien books with blood and gore,and if to have them or not. personally I like books with blood and gore; because it shows how the world auccualy is. It'snot like a book where you save the princess or damsel in destress.      Lastly if parents are conerned about offensive books don't let your kids get those kind of books give them a boring book. I mean we know the books that kids are not supposed to read but parents let kids read them.      In conclusion if you feel that a book is offensive do't pick it up, and don't have it taken off the shelf because there is always someone to disagree with yo",3,3
3549,"Libraries hold many books and movies such as fiction, nonfiction, historical, fantasy, and adventure.  These books have many different styles and portrails and many of these @MONTH1 be takeno offensive but that doesn't mean that they can just be taken off the shelf.     One book that comes to my mind that can be seen as offensive is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'.  This book talks about blacks as slaves and how they should be whipped for being let go and it call them @ORGANIZATION1 offensive names yet it is a classic and is in almost every book store or library in the country. Why, because it was written back when slavery was legl and slaves were treated as property not people.    A movie that many people have seen recently is slumdog @CAPS4.  This movie has a boy from a slum being tortured because he knows the answers to the questions on the gameshow '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 to be a @CAPS4?'.  Many indians @CAPS2 are smarter could be offended by this because they are saying if you grow up in a slum you can't be smart.  But, people blow it off because it is a movie so it isn't real.       But if you go to somepeople and ask them about these books are movies some will say they are @ORGANIZATION1 good others might be offended so they might as weel stay on the shelfs.  The book '@CAPS5 @CAPS6' is a book about the civil war could this be scene as offensive showing the thoughts of both sides saying slavery is good and bad at the same time yet it is another classic and will stay on the book shelfs.     So books in libraries shouldn't be censroed because of being offensive to a race, sex, or group; they should stay on the shelf because every books other tahn some childrens books have something offensive.  Thus if we took books off the shelfs for being offensive their would be nothing to read except for 'The @ORGANIZATION1'!",4,4
2981,"In @DATE1's world, there are many things found offensive.  Everyone has their own opinion on what is offensive and what is not. Many parents are becoming upset because they think their children are viewing things that they should not.  Other people are upset because they think the libraries are offending their culture or way of life.  This is even taken to the extreme where people want censhorship on libraries to avoid this, which is wrong.     Some people are becoming concerned about the materials in libraries.  They find these things to be offensive.  Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but there really is nothing anyone can do if someone is offended.  The world is a public place and everywhere we go, something might be found offensive.  The library is a place for study.  It is never intended to offend someone, or bring bad to the world.  It is simply a place to inform, and if someone is offended by what they see, they should stay away from the library.     I have been to the library many times, none of which have I ever seen anything offensive.  Everything I have ever witnessed at the library is for learning and research.  There are certain sections in the library.  If a parent does not want their child seeing something, they should keep their child in the children's section.  I can assure you, there is nothing offensive in the children's section, or else the library would not have it in that section.  The owners of these libraries know what is going to upset people and what will not.  If there was truly offensive materials in the library, those materials would be taken out.     Also, if a person complains, and the materials are removed, it could lessen someone else's chance getting the materials they need.  One person could think the material is offensive, but someone else might want to learn more about it.  If one is offended by a certain material, all they simply must do, is not look at it.  The library can be compared to a big computer.  One can basically find anything there.  Asking the library to censor their materials is like asking the internet to censor theirs.  It is a way of learning and researching and it would be almost impossible to censor everything there.     Everyone is going to be offended some point in their life.  If the libraries removed everything that could offend someone, they would have no materials left.  People need to stop being so easily offended and realize the library is not trying to harm anyone.  There does not need to be any censorship in libraries.  It is simply trying to teach people about the world and let them enjoy books, music, movies, or whatever else one might go to the library to find.",4,4
3008,"I absolutely do not think that any book, movie, magazine, music, etc., should be removed from the shelf because they find it offensive.  If we do that, then all the books would be off the shelf.  Sometimes the really good books are when they are offensive, because they are actually telling you what they really believe in.     I remember when I was twelve, the news was saying that a school was taking books off the shelf because it offended one person in the school.  The shocking part was that almost the whole school was reading that book.  Even teachers were reading it.  The school board did not even care though.  I think that was completely handled the wrong way.  They should have talked to the girl and said it was unfair to ask that when everybody reads it.  If it offended her, then she should not read it.     Music is an outlet for many people.  They can express their feelings in a way that is amazing.  Without music, there would not be any fun in the world.  People are alwasy listening to music.  When they are sad, mad, upset, confused, etc.  If people think some kind of music is offensive, then they should not listen to it.     Movies are going to be offensive to at least one thing all the time.  That is what makes a movie: a hero and a vilian.  We want to good guys to win.  The movie makes fun of the bad guys.  Somebody is always going to get hurt.     When I read, watch, or listen to something, I do not think of how offensive it is to me or somebody else.  I think of how the artist feels.  Why they wrote it that certain way.  If I am listening to music, I listen to the beat and the words at first.  Then if I like it, I start singing it.  If I do not like it, then I just change the song.     I hope people do not end up just taking things off the shelf when someone is offended.  We need the different opinions in life.  If we all had the same opinions, we would not be ourselves in anyway.  I do not want to be the same as everybody else.  I love my personality.  I am different and kind of an outcast.  But I am true to myself.  And I respect other people's opinions.  I wish everyone would do the same.  Or at least try to do the same.  Thank you for listening to what I had to say",4,4
3522,"People have different opinions what one @MONTH1 find extremely offensive another @MONTH1 not care or even laugh at it. In this next paragraph I will explain the reasons why censorship should not be allowed in libraries.      One of the first things is our freedom of speech. If we really have that freedom the censorship violates it completely. Some people are offensive but you must remember they are entitled to their opinion. They have a right to speak for what they belive in. Whether it be magazines, books, newspapers, movies, or music. The author or artist @MONTH1 use those to spread his/her ideas and beliefs. Another reason is people's opinions. Does one person really speak for an entire gender,country, culture, race, religion? Whether he/she is the lowest of the low or a person of great power, someone @MONTH1 believe different and miss out on something maybe they would have been inspired by or learned from. It is not right to deprive communication through these things. A man @MONTH1 find a book offensive to him or his family but another man just like him @MONTH1 find the book funny and joke about it. People think differently from each other. Personal experiences are also have a place. Maybe a near death experience causes someone to write a book. Maybe a bad break up causes someone to make a song. These help inspire people. No person can tell them it's wrong just because they thinks it's offensive or wrong.     All this things factor in. No one person or group of people have a right to take away our freedom. I am against censorship in libraries and I hope you are too.",3,3
3830,"Have you ever felt as though your reading choices are dwindeling? Censorship is taking away our freedom to experince to read or listen to what we want, who has the right to tell us what we can watch, read or even listen to?     As an avid reader of all kinds of literature i cant stand censorship. Kids today need to be able to read what they want, to open up their minds to new ideas and ways of life. The so called 'banned' books are some of the best anyone can read, as @CAPS1 we should be able to read what we want, wether it is offensive or not.     If you want to put certain restictions on a book such as a age limit i can understad that, but to completely take them off the shelves then we are losing our greatest right as an @CAPS2 citisen. To read and watch or listen other media is a great way to learn about things other than what is in our back yard.     Music and television i understand some censorship, i dont want my little brother or any younger youth hearing the '@CAPS3 bomb' or seeing anythin obsene, but these days its getting harder and harder to control what they watch or listen to seeing how it's so easy to obtain those sources of media.      Many kids today have access to the enternet which can be good and bad. If a parent does not want their kids watching or listening to anything obscene then they have the right to but certain blocks on their computer. Kisd these days mainly use two kinds of media which are the enternet and @CAPS4, but a kid who wants to read should have as many choices as possible weather it be fiction, classics such as 'The @CAPS5 snd The @CAPS6', or educational litterature.     So is our reading choices becoming scarese? Yes i believe so, na it all has to do with censorship. We cant read some of the classics because the're 'racist' or are 'pornagraphic', but you have to understand for the time they were written the weren't. so let everyone read what they want when they want.",4,4
4228,"As a student at a public school, the libraries that I and many other students have access to are censored to an extent. With our library being censored I do not feel that the public library should be.          Why is censorship a conflict in need of discussion; every book found on a shelf is a part of history so every author that was good enough to get published should be able to have their book on a shelf. While school libraries are already censored for their age group; I feel that public libraries should not be censored for the plain reason that you, your gaurdian, but also the library has control over what they find age appropriate.           If disliking the book is a problem; then put it back. Find something more common towards your own interest. Some things @MONTH1 be considered inappropriate as many things are, but at the same time each person has their own limits to this. While someone @MONTH1 dislike a teen magazine because of how it effects youth, another @MONTH1 find it inspiring. If every person found a way to rate things according to their own taste, there would be nothing left on the shelves; as Katherine Paterson expressed in her quote.          When you enter a public library; it is divided into sections according to interest, age, author, ect.. When you enter a school library it is done according to fiction, non-fiction and author. Censorship amoung public libraries is not needed. Adults, students, and childeren all go to a public library. So, as the case @MONTH1 be why would you censor a library that goes for all ages. I feel that yes an @CAPS1, or @CAPS2 school library should not contain the same content as a @CAPS3 school library. But a public library, is for the public. Hints the name.          In conclusion, if even more censorship was done to public libraries, libraries would be used less than they already are. Some of the content in public libraries can't be found in school libraries, but also adults wouldn't be able to find the content needed for their own interests, jobs, or even schooling. So as the fact @MONTH1 be that some things @MONTH1 seem innappropriate to certain age groups, it can help someone in a completely different age group.",4,4
3787,I think that all books that are found offensive or sexual shouldn't be taken off the shelves completely. I just think that they should be placed in a certain section of the library where kids should not be at or not allowed to go in like a section only for adults. I think if a kis see something they think is interestiong and will teach them something they didnt know before they're going to pick it up no matter what unless someone steps in and tells them not to.     I dont think kids should be exposed to all of that and some kids are getting ahead were they shouldn't be in life. If a kid decides to try and check out a book like that either they shall have an i.d. or there parent should be with them comfirming they are able to check out that book.     Many children I think are already exposed to things they shouldn't be around and books like that would just make it all worse. Some books send out really bad messages but then again that's only for adults to read it should be kept out of the way of children. Some kids could live in a fanasy world and have a split personality or something off of things like that and it could really affect someone badly.     If a parent wants there kid to have the book or dont mind anything about it then that's there choice they have permission. I know I wouldnt want my kids around that untill they were @NUM1 years of age or older but I know some parents dont really care alot about it. So my best solution for this problem is to keep those books and things out of the reach of children or have a specific age limit.,3,3
3507,"How can writing be offensive? Many @CAPS1 find swear words in writing or violence to be very offensive. Yet others find that those things make their writing more interesting. Writing can cover all aspects of life and give us ideas like racism and other inappropriate thoughts. It seems like in today's writing you can pick up just about anything and somone will find it offensive. That means if we censored our libraries to the extreme there would be no books left. It is just like Katherine Paterson says in the quote, '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS1 can't deny that books and any other writing place ideas in our head. That idea is a seed and we can either choose to water that seed and let it grow or cause it to die out. I believe we have a choice to either except or deny those offensive ideas in our head. If we find something offensive, simply set the book down and use that better judgemnt. We know what is right therefore we decide what is ok to read. Everyone sees things differently.     What about children, can we trust their better judgement? I fear that children don't have as great of judgement as more mature adults. The resposibility of judgement lies more on the parents of that child than the libraries. The libraries place books for kids in a certain section to make sure they find appropriate books for their age. Both the adults and children get to find books that fit them and don't offend them.      If libraries did do censorchip it would deny us our rights and freedom to speek our minds clearly without a haze being placed to confuse it. We as a country were built off the radical and offensive things written about the @CAPS2. Those words are what fired us up to become an independent country. Just think if they would have censored those ideas. Would we still be @LOCATION1 today? What it all comes down to is not that we should censore our reading but that we should use our better judgement.",4,4
3916,"Censorship is not an easy question to anwser; it involves a great deal of thought. When thinking about a topic like this you must look at a greater picture. You should think about after math like thoughts and opinions from everyone else. When it comes to censorship in libraries I feel that all the books should be left on the selves.      So, why would we take books away from people who want to read them just so that others don't? If you don't want a child to look at adult books, then you can censor them by watching them, and not taking them to places that have such books. This way other people can read these books.  If you truely think about it, then you will relize that if you are trying to keep something from a teen they can, and will, find a way of getting it. If you are trying to keep things from them that will only make them want it more.     Books are good for people. It tells them stories that cannot happen, past events they did not live through, and even the thoughts of others. Keeping books away from people is not good for them; they would not be able to learn from the things they read. So, maybe some books are more racie than others, that does not mean you should hide it from your children.      If you were to start censoring books in libraries it could cause some problems. Now you will have no books for some people. You will have taken most books out of libraries because one person thinks it is not good for the children. This will cause arguments over what should and shouldn't be in the library, and people will stop going to the library all together.     So, when you think about banning books just remember that there are other places to get books. Books are good for people especially teens, whos minds are developing. In some places books that are banned to other places are celebrated. When trying to get rid of books just think about the people you are taking them away from",4,4
3262,"How many of you have ever heard any offensive language? Seen somthing that you think no other kid should see? Im going to guess a lot. Almost every person in the world has heard, said, or seen something that they shouldn't have. Most hear curse words before they can even walk. If you can't keep kids from hearing or seeing anything offensive then why would you try and edit what they read in libraries. After all it is a public place where anyone can go to read in peace.      Almost every person in the world has said or done something wrong, but they learn from it. It allows them to mature and grow up. Children learn new words all their life and are bound to come across some that shouldn't be said. Yet, most will and see what happends and learn from it. If you take out things like that in the books they read, then how will they learn?      The books that children read varys. The younger kids wont know what bad words are until they get older. The books that older kids read @MONTH1 have words in it to display a seriouse part to the story, or a tragic monment in the characters life. Some @MONTH1 even tell of what happens when the characters says a bad word and what happens to him if he says it.       Authers usally vary their vocabulay in the stories that they write. If they are writing about the @DATE1's why would they try and clean up the grammer that was spoken from that time. Try and change what the reader might think about that time.      Leave the libraries' books on the shelves no matter what is in them. Kids always see and hear someing oddensive no matter how hard their parents try. Books use words to display important parts of a story and our history. Books need to stay put in the libraries that they are in",4,4
4418,"Library books offensive? The right to remove a book or not isn't up to us ,people, per our opinions. If someone has an issue with the book; next time don't get it. I know that we shouldn't have the right to remove books from the librarys. It's not up to us to make that choice.     I know people sometimes find somethings wrong or inappropriate in a book at the librarys', but if it wasn't to your liking don't read the rest of it or refer it to a friend. I have had problems with this before. I went to check out a book and my mom said that she didn't like the topic that it was about: honestly its her opinion. A person should have a right to his/her opinions but it shouldn't affect someone elses. One person @MONTH1 really like the book and someone else @MONTH1 hate it, obviously their are people out there who enjoy that type of book so there isn't a really good reason to get rid of it. The only person who should have a say in getting rid of a book would have to be the librarian. That person knows what is acceptable and what isn't for the library. If it includes something graphic or racist, you can talk to them about it in a clam conversation, because they maybe a librarian but they dont read every single book that is in the library.      Some items can be offensive to some but not others. The library is there for knowledge and entertainment. We can have opinions on matters and discuss them appropriately without causing a big ordeal  because their could be reasons why things are where they are. You need to leave the choice up to the person who is educated on the matter/ who is in charge of the library",3,3
4298,"In @LOCATION1, people like to do many dfferent things for fun. Some like to go to movies. Others perfer a nice walk through the park. Now a days everyone is all stuck up and think that we should not see and or read bad, nasty, offensive things. I believe that we should be able to see what ever we want.          The first reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because we have the right to. There are lots of things that we cant do but reading should not be one of those things. We shouldnt have to ask some one if a book is ok to read or not. Its not fair to those who want to read it. I find it very dumb.     The second reason we should be able to read what ever we want is because if you dont like it, dont read it. This is a very simple an straight forward concept. Everybody today is worried about what everyone else is doing. If yo dont like something then dont pick it up and read it. If i knew there was a boook that i didnt like because it was offensive to me, i wouldnt read it. Its just that easy.     The third and final reason why we should be able to read what ever we want is because its none of your bussines what other people do or read. Everbody today is so worried about the next guy that its not even funny. If we all just worried about our selfs, then we would be better off. If i read a book that i found offensive or bad, i wouldnt go around telling others its a bad book and that is should be pulled off the shelfs. Its not right and its not fair.          We should be able to read what ever we want. Its our right to read it. Also, if you dont like it, then dont read it. People today are too worried about other people. If other people want to read a book that you find offensive or bad, there is nothing that you can do about it. That is the way life works.",4,4
3126,"Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? If a library feels that if a book is too graphic, a movie too violent or that music to agressive then its their own choice to remove it or not. It is true that that it's pointless to try and censor the lives of kids and teenagers.Explicit content is all around not only in the media and literature. The never ending game of shielding this generations teenagers and children is already finished.     In this point in time, the main focus of alot of movies and music and books is something violent, agressive, inapproiate, or explicit. The idea of removing these things from library shelves is pointless. The will always be violence and crime in todays world along with excessive swares and cuss words all around. It's exceptable that some parents don't want their children reading,watching or listening to something they don't or wouldn't approve of but even if the kids are protected and home out in the world sometimes the parents wont be there.     Libraries are public places, and a percent of the audience would be upset, frusterated or angr if the books, music or movies they liked were no longer avalable due to the cencorship. It @MONTH1 seem as if viewing, reading or listening to something violent or explicit, would have an effect on the listener. On the streets, at school, at the park and more places children and teens will be exposed to this type or explicit language so attempting to cencor it in their reading and viewing matterial is just pointless.        In my experence I have grown up and been around people who have grown up listening to violent music, watching graphic movies and more explicit material and not been effected. I saw my first rated @CAPS1 movie when i was nine, so parents can give thier kids somewhat of an age but at one point trying to cencor anything is a waste of time. With schools now teaching their students the positives of being abstinent and the sexual deseases, students are more likely to refrain despite what they see in movies, read about, or listen to. Any child exposed to the internet could be subject to all kinds of inapproite material, explicit canotent, bad language, cuss words, and disturbing images.     Real life is rated @CAPS1 so why pretend it's not? Trying to block the explicity and violence in the world is an endless battle. Certain things @MONTH1 go over the line, but others are just renactments and previews of whats really going on in this world.Why would you hinder the real world away from children and teenagers? Movies have a rating and music @CAPS4 have an explicit content label so people should know whats approiate for themselves. The first sware word a child hears probably wasnt in a song or movie and was probably somewhere in the real world.",4,4
4663,"My view opposes the open distribution of certain newspaper articles. There are certain articles, radio shows, and other sources of media that vividly describe certain things that happen in the news that I find not to be appropriate for some people to hear such as younger children, or people that don't agree with having to listen to things such as: bias reactions, opinions, and interpretations of these things.      Open distribution of newspaper articles and things containing disturbing images ought to be censored. I recently seen photos of people who have been killed in the process of finding @LOCATION1. I find that these images @MONTH1 serve some importance to people interested, but for children who can look on their doorstep and look at the newspaper, can see horrifying images that some people @MONTH1 think they shouldn't be exposed to. Even as adults people don't necessarily agree with it. Adults @MONTH1 see what's in the news and @MONTH1 find it to be intriguing as it pertains to them or fairly disturbing, but as far as the protection and limited exposure their children @MONTH1 have, it @MONTH1 not be such a good thing for their kids to be hearing.      I was in the car heading back from school one day, and my dad had just picked me up from school, and I casually switch the raido from am to fm as I always do when I get in the car, but I didn't hear the sudden outbreak of a top one hundred song as I had expected, I heard a woman asserting her opinion about the death of @LOCATION1 to a talk radio show host. The show had previously been recorded, and so after the woman had lashed out for being so angry about the whole thing, there was a review of other calls that other people had made in mad frustration about the womans' comments. She had said earlier that it was wrong to have killed somebody, in which the talk radio show host responded with the argument that it was okay for @LOCATION1 to kill thousands, but we can't kill him argument. The reviews that the other callers had made sort of disturbed me. The things that the callers were saying were very offensive towards the woman who had expressed her feelings. The other callers were saying that she needed to get out of our country, and were cursing at her. News like the death of @LOCATION1 isn't just violent in itself, but creates reactions that are very violent as well.      Another instance when I was exposed to some information that @MONTH1 not have been well accepted by others was when we were having an assembly meeting at my school, and we watched a video about a protest that was against people of @CAPS1 belief. The whole problem with the protest was that the people of the @CAPS1 faith were born in @LOCATION3, and were meeting with representatives in order to help a poor community in @LOCATION2. Although they were making an effort to help the poor communities, and homeless people in @LOCATION2 there were people shouting at the im protest to leave, and to go back to where they came from. When people hear things about this in the news it can be very offensive, because although it @MONTH1 be happening on a complete opposite coast, it would be able to effect someone, it can easily effect someone who doesn't understand previous conflicts that would shape these peoples' opinions and @MONTH1 take that very offensively, because it is a very complex matter even though it is still very wrong.      I believe that the material that is being exposed to people of all ages should be censored, because the material that is being openly distributed now isn't necessarily suitable for everyone, and some people @MONTH1 not want to hear about it, and want to avoid the news that is going around about certain topics that they @MONTH1 not be comfortable with",4,4
3034,"Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 quote is reflecting people wanting to rid of some of the literature, books, magazines, music, and movies in libraries, because they think that the material is inappropriate.  If we got rid of all of the books from @CAPS1 world, we would have nothing left to learn from, and some of the main sources of entertainment would vanish. I believe that certain materials should not be replaced from the shelves, because the youth of today need to learn about the true past, people should learn about how cultures really are, authors and writers need to be able to express themselves, and parents should be able to control what they believe their children should and should not read.       If it were not for books and novels from the past, the current generations would have no clue of what history was about.  Children should be allowed to read books such as @ORGANIZATION1, The @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in order to get a taste of how much times have changed.  Stories from grandparents only take a person back about @NUM1 years; we need sources that can take us back thousands of years.  Some families, such as an @CAPS6 @CAPS7 family, might get offended if their children are reading books that say things like 'nigger,' but that is our history.  It is something we cannot change, and it is important for kids to know how things really were and how terrible people were treated.  We also do not want today's youth making some of the terrible mistakes generations in the past made, so they need to be taught about the real but sometimes horrendous situations.     Learning about different cultures would be another issue if books and movies were depleted.  Money is not available these days to just travel to different countries and experience their culture.  How is a young girl from a small town in @LOCATION2 supposed to find out how people in @LOCATION1 live their life?  For all she knows, the people could be living in igloos.  I believe that it is important for people to understand different cultures and religions in order to accept them in society.  Movies can teach a lot about different countries, and books do a wonderful job as well.  If they are gone, cultures would be misunderstood and forgotten.     Also, authors and directors need to be able to express themselves.  Every since people are young, they are taught that it is important to be unique and express their own style.  Not every writer is going to want to write about butterflies and rainbows.  There are people that love writing about violence, gore, and segregation.  Those things are part of the world today and everyone needs to face that reality.  Getting rid of all of those books from library shelves will not solve the problems; it would only cause people to not expect what might happen to them or @CAPS1 world.       Now, some parents @MONTH1 have hard times when their young boy comes home from school with an offensive book, but parents should have control over their kids.  If they have a problem with what their children are reading, then they should deal with that personally.  They do not need to influence other people's lives by trying to get rid of the materials off of public libraries' shelves.     Why people would even consider getting rid of history and learning materials about cultures and different subjects in @CAPS1 world is beyond me.  It would be like asking someone to rewind time so that we would not have had slavery, depressions, world wars, and homicides.  It is impossible to undo history, but we can learn about the things from the past in order to not make the same mistakes and things of the current world in order to be accepting and understanding.  Books, magazines, movies, and music are wonderful.  They represent self-expression and freedom of speech, so people should let them be an entertainment and learning source.  Without them, we would be and have nothing",4,5
3841,"Books movies and music should not be removed from the shelves. For many of years people would come to the libaray for them. some  @MONTH1 be volger as well as they @MONTH1 be offensive, but there should be a age check out law. as well as being with in consideration for this centerys ways.     There are many people who thribe off of the horrable thing people put out in to the world. They love to pain of others. Instead of taking the offensive work off the shelves, there should be a age limmit to what sertan age groupes should read. Yees there are young kids who are reading this kind of things, but that lyes with the parents.           If there was a age limmit of what people should be able to read then that would solve the problem.As well we could have the parents sign out the book saying it is okay for their child to read such a book.      if we  had all of this then there would not be any more problems. it would be a nice controled libaray. so in conclustion this is the way to go. this is the futur of tommorw",3,3
3910,"Do you think that books, music, magazines, movies should be removed form a libraries shelf?     A libarys should carry every kind of book, movie, Magazines, Music etc.  The reason that a libary should carry every thing is because say a farmer wants to come in and get a book over cattle and some city person says that its no use and throws it away the farmer is outta luck or say the oppiset would happen.  Another reason would be a persons tasted some people like romance and some like action etc so if they dont carry one type someone will get mad about it and stop going. Say if @PERSON2 dose not like viloence so they take it off the shelf and @PERSON1 dont like chick flicks etc what would that leve in a libary no one would have anything to read and they would close the libary down because there would only be a few books.  The movies and magazines i would say carry anything that was approperat and if it was rated @CAPS1 you had to be @NUM1 to rent it then the person would be a adult. There is different cultures out there that only like certon thing so what are they going to do make seperate libarys so that each culture will be happy or just build one big libary and the ones that dont like just leve the book or whatever there.  Altmentley its up to the parent to tech there chiled noy yo pick up the bad items if there not liked by a certin family or cultuer.  If they would get rid of the stuff one person didnt like it would loss custmers and make others mad so in my eyes its better to have one person mad becaues a libary carryes a certian type of item then to loss custmers and make @NUM2 people or even two to make one person happy when it is as simple as dont pick it up.     So altimently we can not make everyone happy so just look over the items you do not like teach your childern not to bring them home and move on in life and dont start a problem",3,3
3763,"Books and movies are a way for many people to use their imagination and creativity. Taking certain books off the shelves @MONTH1 have a negative effect on people. Certain books, music, movies, and magazines are not always as bad as what some people think. People have different views on what is good and bad, so you cannot really remove certain books because, like Katherine Paterson said, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We need to leave every book on the shelves. Using my own observations, reading, and my own experience I will prove to you that we need those books on our shelves.     First, I watch younger children getting so many books off the shelves and maybe they aren't the best for them. I believe from watching them, that it helps them grow. Being a young kid you're curious and they need to be able to look at just about anything. Honestly, if it's really that bad to you they won't remember it the next day. Personally I think that them seeing what we call 'bad things' will make them not want to look again, and help them learn right from wrong.      Secondly, I have seen many magazines, read many books, and watched many movies that I probably shouldn't have. I feel from seeing and reading those things it has made me a better person not to do the 'bad things' that they are doing. I've read books about slavery, and war and it just wants me to make the world a better place. Knowing that younger children than I are reading and seeing all this negativity in this world doesn't always put me in the spot to say 'keep everything on the shelves,' but I also believe children will know between right and wrong.     Lastly, I have experienced children and young adults abusing the library and getting movies they shouldn't be watching, which would make many people want to take certain books off the shelves. Certain books need to be kept away from young kids, but not from everyone.We older, and more wiser adults need to realize that it's not all bad, yes bad for our young ones but maybe not for someone else. A family member of mine is a photographer and he looks at nude magazines and movies to help him with his career. Not every nude movie and magazine is abused, and everyone should realize this.     All in all, I understand of removing some books, magazines, and movies but we can't. I don't believe a certain book is offensive to everyone, just certain people. Different people need books and movies for different things, and they aren't all used for bad. We need to all come together as one to keep certain books out of young peoples' reach, so that the books and movies aren't abused. Hopefully, everyone keeps every book on the shelves. Again, as Katherine Paterson stated, '...Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' if we remove them",4,4
3798,"How would you feel if your son or daughter saw a naked picture of someone, kept hearing bad words from a song that was in the library! Would you really want that for your child? Thought a library was supposed to be a learning center, didnt know it was a bad place to be. People have their own opinions in everything! A lot of things these days are changing and it's not for the better! Television, books, and music are becoming dirty and unenjoyable to people. Please help try and help us stop this! We don't want it getting to our kids, like it has to others!     Some people like these kinds of things with bad actions in them! One thing that catches them is the beat, it just makes them want to start dancing. Another reason why they like it is beacuse their friends like it also! People these days are becoming more of followers than leaders like they should be. When people grow up they usually have an idol whether its a singer, book writer, or actor. When that idol grows older it most likely isnt going to be the same person with the same thoughts it had @DATE1, they change for the worse most of the time! They get caught up in drugs or the fame that it puts them in. When that happens people loose than interste in them unless they think its cool! It all just depends on the person! Some people thrive off of these things!     Libraries are supposed to be for all ages! If a kid finds something that was bad at a library and tells their friends or parents thats just putting down the library and they aren't going to want to go there anymore. This is just hurting the library because it will loose a lot of their buisness. Young kids these days are being expossed to a lot of more things that they should'nt be! What little kids already know is sickning! Hearing them say that they have boyfriends and girlfriends, and how they know bad words just at the age of @DATE1! It might have to do with the parents or the friends the kids choose but in my opinion it's right! Kid's are growing up way to fast because of the things that they know!     Movies, music, books, etc. are not like they used to be in the fifty's, even the eighty's, yeah they werent the best, but its gotten a little extreme theses days. The words that they say in songs, the things we see in movies, and the picture we see in magazines are getting out of hand. There should be a section that is blocked off only for eighteen and older that has all the bad things in the music, movies, and, magazine articles/picture. People shoud have id's that they have to have to get into this section! This is going to try and prevent kids from seeing what they are these days when they are at a young age. This might not even work, but its worth a try!      The world is'nt a happy place anymore! It's filled with violence, sex, drugs, etc. Some parents don't care about the things that their child does, says, or sees. It all just depends on the family. Whether they believe in @CAPS1 or if they don't is another example of this! It always affects ther actions and thought! People try and do the littlest things, and they try and make a difference in the world. That is what people need to do, not get involved in horrible things. They need to get involved and stay out of these bad things; seeing bad picture, hearing bad words, and watching horrible things in movies. Try to make a difference! dont be a follower because it's not going ti get you anywhere in life! Everything counts!",4,4
3777,"Materials that are offensive for some people in my point of view should not be removed from the shelves. If some people are offended by materials they shouldn't pay any mind to those certain materials. If everybody paid attention too offensive entertainment regardless to what kind, people would be upset all the time. There are many things people see, hear, and read about that @MONTH1 be offensive. Don't take everything seriously most of those offensive things @MONTH1 just be a joke or just someone trying to get attention.               When you just sit and think about it, most television shows you would watch everyday @MONTH1 have at least one moment that's says something offensive. In example I watch a television show some nights that says something racial about @CAPS1-@CAPS2. I don't pay the show any kind of attention because I know it's a show their just trying to get more rating. So when it really comes down too it I am goin to be watching the same show again the next night.      What if some of our most historical people had listened to everything that everyone esle said about them. Then, our black culture and history wouldn't be so '@CAPS3' today. I probably wouldn't be able too take this test that im doing right now. So don't take everything so serious everyone has some type of  humor.     If we removed everything that was offensive today. Some of your favorite actors and singers wouldn't be the famous actors or singers you love and respect today. All of the grammy's and award shows that we watch on television would not be themselves. There are all kinds of different genre of music. Some of the words that different artists use would be offensive but they still release those same songs because they're only words.     My conclusion, is that anything and anyone can be offended or offensive. People don't take everything serious because it might just be a joke or some ignorant person that needs attention. When I was younger my mother always said 'sticks and stones @MONTH1 break your bones but words only make you'. So don't take everything serious I mean it's only the media, tell me who does take them seriously",4,4
3978,"In the words of the author, Katherine Paterson, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the sheld---that work I abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 are countless books in the world which will offend someone in one way or another. If everyone were to expect their feelings to be accounted by everyone, they are mistaken. Everyone has a right to discover the thoughts of others as long as they keep in mind they @MONTH1 not always be pleased with the outcome. Certain books carrying harsh opinions or uncencored material can be found on every shelf. As my many years as a student, I have come to find books containing vulgar images and language.     @PERSON1's play '@CAPS2' describes him in very crude ways. Our class was very surprised at the language and sexual innuendos involved. @CAPS2 was described as a 'black ram' by his nemesis. Comments such as these in books can mold a young mind into thinking name calling is appropriate. Unfortunately, this is how children are to learn the nature of select authors and the world outside the classroom. @PERSON1 also discusses a 'strumpet' in '@CAPS2'. Once a mind is aware of such adult matters they will look at the world completely different. Life must be hard for children as their books and magazines show racy pictures of girls and advertisements for products.     Magazines are a threshold of adult matters. Once a teenager or child view all the vibrant advertisements and beautiful models selling products, they begin to lose a sense of reality and childhood. The photoshopped images of tall, tan, and thin models make a girl's head ponder that way of life. They begin wearing shorter skirts, dieting, and tanning all because of an ad they saw in their magazine. Who wouldn't want to be like a model? When every actress, singer, and model begin looking like godesses, the men picture the perfect girl as the ones they see on billboards. After the men picture the ultimate female as the images they see, the women will never be able to add up to their qualifications. A whole cycle of being underappreciated and the obsession to be perfect makes the media more powerful.     In conclusion, the world has become absorbed in the unrealistic fantasies racy books and magazines provide. Crude comments are found in classics and are a powerful influence on the mind. Advertisements in magazines cause a sense of worthlessness in women and the feeling of unfulfillment for men. Are you going to control you're life or let the media?",4,4
4531,"Book Censorship     Censorship in libraries are a major problem in the @LOCATION1. The question is, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' Or another question is, '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' @CAPS2 are very commonly asked questions, and should have attention put toward them.     In my oponion, books should have a age limit on them. My reasoning is becuase, kids under @NUM1 years of age should have a place where they can find good books for thier age group. There are plently of books out there for all age groups. A kid under @NUM1, should not be able to check out a book, magazine, movie, or music that has offensive language, racial slurs, or dirty behivor from the character, or artist.      Another reason @CAPS1 libraries should have a age limit on things you can check out, is becuase kids can get the wrong idea. Lets say, a book has a statment in it that says '@CAPS3, I went to my bestfreind's house and drank alcohol.' @CAPS4 would be somthing that a child should not able able to read. It would give the child the wrong idea in what they 'could' be doing.     The age limits for book shelves should be as followed:@CAPS5 @NUM3 @NUM4 @NUM5 @NUM6 @NUM1-@CAPS6     @CAPS7 the books in @CAPS2 age groups would probably help stop the refrain on parents worrying about what their kid is reading. Plus, it would help the kid in deciding on what to read. I really think that @CAPS7 books in @CAPS2 age groups, will stop the commotion.     Censorship is a major problem in the @LOCATION1. With everything I have listed, I am pretty sure that the questions, 'Should we have a age limit on what people can check out?' and '@CAPS1 did they let my child check that out?' with be answered. Age groups on books, is a great idea.",4,4
3187,"The media is a way for some people to get out and reach others. Whether it is a magazine, movie etc everyone in the world is going to see it some way or another. If that piece of work isn't seen as acceptable from many peoples point of views it shouldn't be available to the public.       I personally beleive that if something is seen as volgure and offence it shouldnt be displayed. Millions of people will be viewing this and I wouldn't want my kid looking at it. Why would anyone else want the opposite? Kids pay attention to detail really well and something so negative could change the mindset of the child. We all want to bring our kids up right and letting them have availabilty to negative material is uncalled for.  Its not only kids either that are affected, adults also are affected by the media. Adults can get fooled too, beleive me.      I remember one time that there were books and magazines at my school that were being taken off shelves for this exact same reason. I beleive that what the librarians did was right. Some kids in the school shouldn't be viewing or reading about unacceptable things. Some students @MONTH1 not have matured enough and can take something in a different view than another student.      I beleive that if something is taken off a shelf because it doesn't seem appropriate enough I stand for whoever it is that did it. Nothing with a negative affect on a person should be viewed by an innocent child. There should be a positive affect on the child at all times so he or she is brought up to the best of its abilities",3,4
4050,"Somethings on the shelfs in books stores and other places can be very offensive. I think having cuss words in music and sexualy things can be offensive to women. I do listen to some music but noting like that becasue I think it should not be in music and books. One day I Think the @CAPS1.S.A will be ran by a woman.      @CAPS3 is noting wrong with that. Woman have the same rights as @CAPS2 do. @CAPS3 is some people that think woman are just @CAPS3 slaves, that is dead wrong. Woman and @CAPS2 are the same no matter what people say.      Katherine Paterson as the right idea though. It would be great if the law would state that if you think something is offensive you should be able to take it off the shelf and throw it away, but some people would say other because @CAPS3 is some people out @CAPS3 who just care about them selfs and acted what ever way they want to so they can act or make them selfs feel better than they are. @CAPS3 are some kids who like to look and go though magazines and see all that bad thing they think that those people are cool so they teaches them how to acted and do bad things, That it why i think we should be able to take it off the shelfs     @CAPS3 was this one day I was in @CAPS4-mart just looking around and I saw a magazines with some movie star holding her three kids. The title of the magazine was superstar. It really hurt to see those three kids on the cover becasue one day they @MONTH1 not be like @CAPS3 parents and have all the money in the world.      It @MONTH1 seem really stupid these days that some people would care this much, I really think deep down that its life and we all need to get over our selfs becasue we can not all be right and have all the same feelings for life.          All my life I have thought about this subject cause it seems like now days its all about the money, what @CAPS3 wear and what type of car or truck they drive. It seems really stupid but when i see someone who drives a new car worth @MONEY1 it really makes me think about how someone as the money for this car and everything else.",2,2
3166,"Every author has an intended audience when they are writing a book, and they write about what they think is appropriate for that certain audience.  Unfortunately, sometimes other people that are not intended to read the book actually do read it even though it @MONTH1 not be something that they are supposed to be reading.  When an author writes a childrens book, it is meant for a child to read, not an adult.  Also when an author writes a romance novel, it is meant for people who can comprehend what the authr is talking about and can act maturely while reading it.  Although some novels @MONTH1 not be appropriate for certain people, censorship in libraries is not they way to fix that, and it is a big mistake.     As humans we are given certain freedoms, and one of those freedoms is the freedom of press.  Authors should be able to write about whatever they choose to write about.  If they choose to write about subject's that are not appropriate for all age groups they still have the right to have their books in libraries.  Even though everyone isn't supposed to read them, certain people are. If you take those books away because your scared that a child might get ahold of one, then your taking away what certain people enjoy reading.     Due to the fact that different books are intended for different age groups, libraries have different sections filled with a variety of authors.  They have a children's section made primarily for children,an adult section with books that only adults are supposed to read and a teen section for everyone in between.  By having sections within them, libraries are trying to keep people reading what they were intended to read without censoring or taking away people's favorite books.  Having sections in libraries is a happy medium between letting anyone read whatever book they would like no matter how inappropriate it @MONTH1 be, and cutting out certain books all together.     If a person is an adult, they should be allowed to go to the library and get whatever type of book, magazine, music, or movie that they want.  If a kid's parent is okay with them checking out or looking at certain things then it shouldn't matter to anyone else if they think that the material is offensive.  Instead of censoring what movies, books, magazines, or music that libraries have, there should be a certain age when someone can come in without a parent and check out whatever they would like.  If a person is under that age then their parents should be present while they check out so they can approve of what their child is checking out.     Censorship in libraries is ultimately pointless and shouldn't even be considered.  Whether some people find certain material offensive or not, there are other ways to get that material so there really is no point to censoring anything in libraries",4,4
3762,"I think censorship  should be allowed and the libraries because many people have diffrent oppions of what type of books they like and should read.I don't think people should remove books or any type of materials just because of hte dislike.Many people think by looking a diffrent types of  materials can have you look for the right imformation.I feel that if you limit the books and libraries that whould be less resources to help out with the imformation that you are trying to recieve.Many people find it hard if the imformation they are wonted is not there and the local libraries. Libraries should a be able to find all the books, music, movies and magazines they wont and need.Books should never be tooking of the self but only should be allowed more on the shelves for any imformation that are needed",2,2
4046,"Do you want your children to have bad images in their head? Does everybody deserve to read or watch anything they want? I believe strongly that these materials should be removed from libraries in most cases. Offensive materials have no business being in libraries. These materials are not good for children, offend people, and do not look good on the libraries that carry them.     First, I believe there is absolutely no reason for any child to see explicit material. This material can create a very ambitious young child. If a child sees a magazine containing pornography, the child will think that this material is acceptable. The truth is, that child should not know about anything of this subject until he or she receives approval from his/her parents. I know from experience that most parents would not want one of their children to see any of this material for a very extensive time. I have had a few disturbing experiences myself. One time when I was a young lad, I checked out a horror movie from the local library not knowing what the movie was about. I made sure my parents were not home when I watched it. After about three minutes, I was terrified. The images from the film stayed in my head for a good month. Children do not deserve the feeling of fear for that long of a time.     Next, some material in the library contain certain things that offend random people. Large public libraries contain music with explicit lyrics. We, as a society, do not want our youth to hear the nasty words in some of the rap songs that are released. In addition to that, this music offends many adults as well. Adults agree that there is no reason for any rap to be released in a public place like a library. Music is a very great art, but when certain people abuse it, it no longer has a good image. I have observed that children listening to rap at a very young age are more likely to end up turning out to be an unsuccessful individual.     Also, some specific magazines contain images that are offensive to the people of our society. This idea relates to my first idea, but I will speak some of it again. Images like blood can sometimes offend the people of our generation. We do not need any of this. If offensive material was banned from libraries, our society would have eliminated one more problem that is taking away from our good world. I have been offended of some different magazine pictures before. Someday when I have kids, I will never let them go to certain sections of the library with this material.     Last, I want to address the fact that specific libraries can carry a bad reputation if they carry this material. In addition, employees will definitely go to a different library without the bad music and the violent movies. Most of the adults that want their children to be successful and have a good, creative mind will think twice about going to the library without censorship of certain items. I have read that libraries with bad material are much less likely to attract customers than libraries with censorship. I know that if I was the manager of a public library, I would make sure that any items that have the potential to offend people would be immediately removed. A library should definitely not want that bad gossip to go around town about how bad that specific library is. Censorship is as necessary to libraries as flavor is to food. Shelves that contain inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only make their number of customers drop. If you think that this is only going to help libraries, I dare you to go ahead and try it out.      Everyone has their own opinions, but I am a firm believer in censorship at public and private libraries. Inappropriate books, magazines, and music will only destroy the good reputation that a library @MONTH1 have. A library is a great place to be, but the libraries without censorship are an utter disappointment. After all, it is your life, and you get to choose the way you want your children to act. Disturbing materials are only going to bring a negative effect on these minors. I hope to see the amount of censorship rise in libraries. If it does, people will see a dramatic change in all of my ideas discussed.",4,4
4580,"Yes, I do think so because everyone has an opinon to say and its something people like to look at or leason to. Now it would be diffeint if it was a childerins book store like if they have music like christin bible songs or desine movies in the store but not to have grown-up stuff.     I really do not see the big deal if they are out because everyone likes reading somthing differint. I think as long as your reading whats it matter what it is or as long as your learning something.      I do not think u can get stuff out like movies and magazines because people like to read them to much or leason to music. So it shoukld not really matter what or where they go if you ask me",2,2
4706,"In my personal opinon I think that those books that have things that you don't want to read or you think are offensive should stay. It's not like that person that is offended by it has to read it.            Say you are in the library and you see a book that you think offends you. You think to your self that book should be removed from the library just because you think it is offensive, but you have to think in other peoples shoes.     Just becaus you think a book is offensive doesn't mean that everyone else will think it is. That is why they have age groups and grade levels that are set up so a kid who likes picture books will not get stuck with a book that has curse words or other things that are meant for adults. Same concept with movies, magazines, music, and etc.     Take this for example. I was walking through the library when I saw a book called @CAPS1 the @ORGANIZATION1, and I thought to myself that looks like a stupid book and I wouldn't want to read it. I think that they should throw this book away. Now lets think does that sound fair. Maybe that is some kids favorite book and when he comes in there the next day it is gone.      What about this, lets say you go in to look for your favorite book and you find out that someone found it offensive or someone just didn't like it as much as you did so they threw it away. Doesn't seem to fair does it.     In conclusion that is what i think about removing books that are offensive or some people just don't like. I think they should leave it on there because we shouldn't remove it based on our personal opinon.",3,3
3920,"Certain materials, such as books, music, magizines, etc., should never be removed just because a certain person, or group of people, find it offensive. The authors of these books have the right, as stated in the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, to have the freedom to say what the wish within the context of their own individual wrighting. Also, certain materials that some people find offensive have little to no offensiveness to many other people who @MONTH1 enjoy the book or movie. Finally, many books that are on the shelves of many of our libraries have no end to the amount of things that @MONTH1 be considered offensive, but allow a certain knowledge to be had by, not only the writer, but the reader as well.      If something is stated in such an important document as the @CAPS1 of the @LOCATION1, one that set the standard for living and set the laws of a nation to parchment, than it should, for lack of a better term, be taken with the utmost respect and dignity. Several great leaders, such as the first president of the @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION2, decided that freedom of the press was a viable asset to a new and growing country. This simple fact alone should hold more than enough levity to allow all materials, no matter how offensive, to not only be published, but also enjoyed by all people. It is this simple freedom that causes books to be published, even written, no matter how offensive they @MONTH1 be.     Certain materials that a person, or group of people, find offensive @MONTH1 not be offensive to everyone. No matter what religion, ethnicity, or moral values you hold, just because it is offensive to you does not mean that it is offensive to everyone. Many people in this world serve in their nations military, ones used to fight more battles than any history book could hold, is just one example that not everyone in this world holds the same morals or ideas that others do, and tensions will always arise because of it. That being said, this also holds true to the way certain people percieve literature and art. @ORGANIZATION3 would hate @ORGANIZATION2's art, and @ORGANIZATION2 would hate @ORGANIZATION3's, however, neither has the right to condone it or to keep it from the eyes of the world.     Many times literature gets removed before their true meaning can be shown to anyone. This is disheartening for several reasons, one being that whatever we, as a human race, could've learned from this piece is now lost forever. Many books could teach the older generations how to leave a legacy for generations to come. Others @MONTH1 teach how future generations can change the world by simply working hard and doing their best. These are best portrayed in books that are sometimes removed from the shelves because of hard lessons or graphic words used.      Is censorship in libraries ok? No. Not at all. All works of literature should be allowed to be read and enjoyed, not only by the author, but also by the young, the old, and all ages in between, of all races and religions. The longer we allow materials to be removed from the shelves of our libraries, the less of a chance we are giving, not only ourselves, but future generations to learn and be all that they can possibly be.",4,4
3082,"NEWSPAPER     @CAPS1 today im going to tell you what I think on offensive materials in libraries.Offensive materials such as books,magazines,music,movies are found in libraries to some people.But to others they can think its perfectly ok to have in a public place.Thinking somethings offensive is just an opinion and every person has a different look on things.     The first thing I have to say about this topic is that these items should not just be taken off the shelves and thrown away.Some people can find these items very educational and they might be able to relate to that  book that other people would say is offensive.And if offensive materials are really bothering some people and the libraries are getting alot of complaints they should just make a section in the library just for the offensive books,movies,ect.So people wont have to look at those offensive materials.Another thing is that libraries are a public place and they should have a wide range of books,movies,ect.Because not every one likes the same thing.People have different intrests and outlooks on different things.So people should just except the things that they might not be into because other people might be really into that.And dont always just think about yourself look at the big picture.     So there are some of my thoughts and feelings on what I think about offensive materials in libraries.And I hope that you can see my point that im trying to get across.",3,3
4196,"Living in todays society there are many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions. There are an uncountable number of diffrent ways people look at the world and ways that people percieve things. To tell someone what they should and should not know is simple minded in the aspect that anyone can percieve a book, music, movie, or magazine diffrently.     @CAPS3 quote by Katherine Paterson,in short, metophorically uses a book and a shelf to let the reader comprehend the importance of information that is passed down from generation to generation. The book represents the information in the world and the shelf stands for the the place the imformation is stored for one to go seek information.     To remove the book off the shelf indefinatly is to close the mind of a future generation. It was once said ' you can not know your present without knowing your future.' @CAPS1 the book @MONTH1 offend one reader it could also inspire another as well. Everyone has a diffrent opinion and life style. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people are granted with better lifestyles than others, @CAPS2 are unfortunatly living everyday in struggle.      One book that @MONTH1 offend a person who thinks the book is harsh and should be taken off the shelf, could also inspire a young child going through struggle's to overcome there surroundings and be a better person.      I have read many books that did not interest me and passed them on to my sibligs and friends. Shockingly the book interested them. After interviewing my siblings and friend over the book it turns out that they got a diffrent message from the book than I. No one thinks the same thoughts a hundred percent of the time.      '@CAPS2 @MONTH1 argue that the glass is half empty while others argue it is half full.' @CAPS3 quote is a perfect example of the minds of the world today. Ultimatly if everyone thought the same then everyone would be the same person. To 'leave no books left on the shelf for any of us' is like programing a robot to only do what you say.      In such a diverse community it is impossible to remove any book off the shelf. Living in todays society there many diffrent people and many diffrent outlooks on things, the world is a diverse place that should have no restrictions",3,4
3238,"I honestly don't think anything offensive should be removed from libraries, children don't really know what those offensive things mean.The library is the only good place to find information or to find a book that they enjoy. If you take things that @MONTH1 seem offensive to people; people are going to have a hard time finding any facts or anything they neeed.     People use offensive things all the time but not everyone means to insult anyone in any way. The library doesn't intentionally insult people. The library just gives us facts  about what we need to know about a person or anything like that. Some people don't know how to be mature when it comes to things like that and if they cant be mature about stuff like that then they don't need to be in the library.     I would understand if the intentions were to insult someone but their not so why should the magazines, movies, books, an music be taken out of the library. Thats just not fair to others when they are trying to get some information. Slavery is an offensive thing to colored people cause the colored people get called names that i will not say in this essay. Most people have matured over the years about what happened in the past.     Honestly I think people will be ok they dont need to get all bent out of shape because they see something offensive they just need to know that it wasnt intentionaly done",2,3

Well because the adult and older tenageers should be able to handle and act like adult when reading the book, watching the movie, listening to music. If the type of book, movie, or music is causing violent behavior around the town then i will completly remove the item from the shelf. Its that simple.           If parents get mad and angree because of these books, movie, and music don't let your children watch, read, or listen to them.

Watch @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1 not @CAPS3 on a @CAPS4.         My questions is, '@CAPS5 not let people read and watch something that they want even if it is offensive?' @CAPS6 people love watching the scary and offensive movie or listening to the rap music.

Any time I look through the library, I come across a few books that are slightly inappropriate. However, @CAPS2 I see these books, I don't make a big deal about it. I just put that book down and continue my search. I couldn't imagine how scarse out book selection would be if we were to rid the libraries of all books that people might find offensive.

If we were to remove all @CAPS4 text from libraries, then we would have a hard time passing the word of @CAPS5 to people who do not have access to such literature.     Although I do not fully agree with the ideas of many theorists, I do not ask that their work be banned from public libraries. I don't like @PERSON1's book on eveolution; but because of our freedom of speech, he has every right to write about his discoveries and belifs.          As you can so clearly see, I am by no means claiming to be open-minded to others thoughts or beliefs. However, @CAPS2 it comes to literature and and art, I think that a variety makes us unique.

Music or movies could be put in there own sections also. Internet could be blocked for certain websites.     Luckly the time we live in has people to prevent these things to happen like adults. And people to watch you and can tell you you are too young for that stuff.     This is what I think it could be easily prevent just put them up or removed and taken off shelves. If they are offensive remove them so we dont have to worry if are children are reading them or not.",3,3
3805,"Censorship in libraries!Do you believe that certianmaterials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?NO!, I do not think they should be removed. I believe everyone is intitled to there own opinion, @CAPS1 if something is offensiv eto one person @CAPS2 @MONTH1 not be to another. No one thinks the same or has the same opinion about somethings thats why there is a variety of books, music, movies etc. If you take out the 'offensive' things, @CAPS2 @MONTH1 cause offense to another.People just need to stop being sefish and understand everyone is different and we all have different interests",3,2
4323,"Should there be cenorship in the Libraries or not? Many people have there own personal view on this subject. Everyone should know their own boundaries of what they know is appropriate to look at and what isn't. Libraries shouldn't have to remove books and etc. that they themselves have purchased to get. Now they want them cenored? i don't think that is very right.          Libraries should take all the cenored material and make a part of the library where the customers can't see from the main section and it would be open to the customers who would like to go in that specific section to check out a book or anything else that @MONTH1 apply to that section. The library was build for anyone who just wanted to go to a place to escape the troubles of their own world and just go sit in a library and read. Not everyone goes to the library for a book, some go to listen to music, some go to read a magazine, well whatever it is for the libraries can't take out the material that people go there just go get. How do they expect customers to come back if they're taking material out of the library? The internet and @CAPS1 is way more offensive than material in a library so what gives them the right to say get all your offensive inappropriate material out of the library. If libraries have to do that then so should all the other entertainment industries.     Finally every library should have their own control over what they think is best for their own facility. My opinion says we should just move the material else where in the building, in it's own little wing or something. Where people could if they would like to go in and check something out but if people didn't want to go in they sure don't have to. Everyone has thier own personal opinion on this subject, and well i gave you mine",3,3
4493,"'@CAPS1 day @CAPS4 @CAPS3, my dad was pulled over three times for @CAPS2: @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5.' @CAPS6 is just @CAPS1 of several quotes from a book that I am reading that some people could take offense to. The book in general is a rather appeasing book, it's just some things, people might take offense to. That doesn't mean the book shouldn't belong on shelves.     I don't think that libraries should be forced to take books off shelves just because they offended someone. That's like saying you should shoot everyone who has made an offensive comment to somebody in their life, you would be left with nothing in the end. If someone finds the things that other people have to say, offensive, they generally stop hanging out with that person. Therefore, it would only make sense for someone to stop reading a book if they find it offensive.     Some magazines have really offensive things in them, that people in the real world say. It's not like your generic non-fiction books that come up with insulting things to say, at a high school level. You don't have to subscirbe to that particular magazine, or even pick it up to read. These days, so many things offend so many people, in so many different ways. What might offend @PERSON1 down the street, @PERSON2 across town might find funny.You cannot make everyone happy, and if you took books off the shlef because someone complained about the offensive things that they read, you would be trying to appease to everyones' wants and needs.     I think it would be fair to put a restriction on books, about age limits. Some of the more offensive ones could have the higher age limits. At the junior high I attended, they have books categorized as 'young adult' books, which means you either have to be in eighth grade or have a note from your guardian saying that it's alright for you to read those types of books. It'd be just like movies; movies have the ratings so that only certain people can watch them, why can't they do the same with books?     I guess what I am trying to say is that it would be very disappointing to me and numerous other people if you just started taking books, @CAPS7, movies, magazines, and so on, off the shelves, and out of market just because someone cried foul against it. If they don't like the material that they are looking at, reading, watching, listening to, or all the above, no @CAPS1 is forcing them to pay attention to it. They can go read the nursery rhymes, because those are not offenesive. Once again I say, taking a book off the shelf everytime someone complains about the material would be like shooting every person who has ever made an offensive comment to someone in their lifetime, you'd be left with nothing.",4,4
4411,"The content in todays materials are not always subtible for young children. Information now distributed in the media and other networks can be harmful for some young children to read or be surrounded by, including video games. By growing up in a violent enviornment, children observe and have the greater chance at becoming violent. The continuence of censorship in todays materials are a necessity to the well being of the children in todays society.     In video games there are ratings that help explain wat is subtible for each age throughout childhood and adolesence. Movies are also the same, making it harder for younger children to see certain movies. Books and magazines are not as well protected although they should be. Age and maturity plays a huge role in whether or not a child should be aloud to read and be introduced to specific material. Violence is a major trend in video games in todays world, and some of the influence it brings on children is unecessary and eventually detrimental to their well being.     The reason ratings should be changed is because children obsorb their enviornment and become what they see, so if they are introduced to violent behavior they have a greater chance in becoming violent children. In libraries there are sections for every age group, specific genre of books, fiction, and non fiction. But some of the explicit material in books and magazines should also be censored before they are distributed on shelves and allowed available for young teenagers and children. As a part of the community libraries should take apart in the well being of the children and not expose them to information earlier than necessary.     Throughout my own experience, I have seen children grow up too fast when exposed to certain knowledge. Especially in todays music, radios do a good job in editing content in songs, by puting parental advisory on certain cd's, but this still does not stop them from buying the material. In games including, @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, @NUM1, etc. teens are now becoming accostumed to this type of behavior, that is not safe nor condusive for children.     By censoring certain material it disallows the continuence of bad behavior amongst our youth today",4,4
4200,"I dont think that they should remove music, movies, magazinwa, etc., Should be tooken away because if you take all of that away then there really wouldnt be anything to do in your spaire time but be bored. I know alot of people couldn't handle being bored. I know I couldnt handle it if all I was bored all the time because someone took away music. Now it would be a different story if we never had music, movies, and all that other good stuff. None would really care becaused they new what it was or hurd about it. How would you feel if you had to drive for @NUM1 hours and didn't have any music or magazines to read? I'm thinking you would be really bored im guessing.",2,1
4539,"Everyone is @CAPS1          @CAPS2 person is @CAPS1, this much we can agree on. So why then would people try to put a censorship on books, movies, magazines, and etc., as i pointed out before, we all are @CAPS1 so we all have @CAPS1 standards on what is bad and offensive to what is good.     When we remove a book from a library shelve for whatever reason we have to do so then others should have the same right to do so as they see fit. If  picked up a book on why @CAPS3 is the right religion and i am a @CAPS4 then more then likely i will find it offensive. Yet if i gave that same book to a @CAPS3, that person would mostly likely read that exact same book that the @CAPS4 read and find it not offensive at all. It all comes down to the veiws we all have about everything so why would you let one person or even a small comittee set standards on library censorship for they @MONTH1 feel one way while another comittee or person feels completly @CAPS1. Everyone is @CAPS1 and feels diferently about issuses. There is no way to make sure that @CAPS2 book in the library won't offend a single person.     The same issue can be applied to music, movies, magnazines and ect. No matter what we do, some one will be offended. For example, the plege of allegiance is something my school says everyday, yet some people, like a @ORGANIZATION1, find it offensive. All acrosss the nation people say it before school, a sportinh game, or ect., yet you don't see very many people objecting to that. I have obsereved that most people who find it offensive just ignore it so why can't we do the same for books, movies, magazines, and etc. that we @MONTH1 find offensive.     In conclusion, there really is no way to put a cencorship in libraries since no matter to tell what a person might or will find offensive. So why then can't we just not read what offends us, this really is the only way to keep from offending  people. For these reasons, I feel that there should not be a cencorship in libraries",4,4
3564,"There are a ton of books out in the world that have a deep meaning and a sense of compasion. But, other books can have mean or hateful affects on the person who is reading it. Censorship, taking books, movies, magazine, etc. off the shelves so a person cannot read or watch them, is a very positive thing.       In many cases censorship is a great thing. It protects young readers from being exposed to hateful things at such a young age. In libraires, the librarian should censor the books for younger people so they do not read the awful and hurtful things the book is saying.      Like books, music, movies, and magazines should be censored, too. Some music has a very catchy beat to it and could get stuck in a young persons head. This @MONTH1 cause an effect on that child and they @MONTH1 start to act like that or want to become like the person the song is describing.      Movies should also be censored. When I was little, my parents did a good job of censoring things that were bad for me to watch at that age. I barly had any nightmares because I was never exposed to that kind of writing when I was a child. On the other hand, my friend's parents were not the best at censorship and allowed her to watch or read whatever she wanted. She had many of nightmares from the movies or books that she read.      Now since I am older my parents are starting to let me watch and read more censored things. In my experiences with this type of material, I have had some nightmares and have personly been offened by some books. Although, censored books @MONTH1 have a great story behind them, the material that supports it can cause a dispute between different people who have different beliefs.      Thousands of books are censored each year. Many of them have to do with different religions or races that people  have different opinions on. Libraries need to censor books to protect the iniscent minds of young childern",4,4
3434,"Dear @CAPS1 or @ORGANIZATION1@NUM1'm writing your newspaper company this letter because @CAPS2 the same way Katherine Paterson feels, and we should not be able to have any of the following books @NUM2,and any sexual books. Because they can scar a kids mind forever, so in my opinion any books with thatstuff in the book should not be on the self for any public library. Also we should have more sensory in books with inaproprite speaking because it can give a person a change in thought.Also let me give you a example,lets say a little boy asks were the action books are, the libarien would say well aren't you a little too young to be reading this books an the child would say no but I heard this was a really good book an my big brother said it a good book too. And in my opinion that is all I need to say.Sincerly your customer @PERSON2.",2,2
4650,My opinion on this subject is its not right. This is a very interesting question. And im going to tell you why i think the way i do. Im for it and against it.     Okay some people like different things and the other people dont agree on it. Thats how things work. If a parent is walking his kid through the mall and goes into a music store and hears the music cussing in it i would not want my kid to be around that and thats what it means by removing something like that because somebody is offened. I totally agree on that. Like ciggerettes. Kids walk in to go buy candy then they go to pay for it and the back wall is full of tobacco products that the kids can see. Once again i would want to remove that from the shelfs.     There would be so many conflicts if this happened. Everyone likes different things. So i think everyone is going to get offened by taking things away that looks offensive towards them. This goes from kids to adults. Every age would be bothered by this.      Now this is my against veiw on this subject. This would make me very mad if i admired something a lot and then come to find out that someone is offened by it so they take it away from the people and that like that object. All this would do is cause problems for everybody and just make everything go bad. Thats how its suppost to be. We all have are opinions. We all like different things. We all have to get over it if we dont like it or dont get along with it. Thats something we have to take in and suck it up.     So on this subject im for both. I see it both ways because its good and bad. People are just going to have to get over the fact that they have to deal with what they see or hear. Its part of life.,3,3
3714,"Yes, I do believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,  should be removed from the shelves if thery are found offensive. The reason why I think some things shuld be removed is because some kids don't need to look at certain things. Parents don't always go with there children to the library and tell them what they can and can't get. At school libraries they really dont have bad things they only have school approte things. But the public library has alot of different things and than a school library. Therefore those are my reaons why i believe certain materials should be removed.",2,2
4633,"Books, magazines and misic should be removed if it has something offensive to the person or the child. Books, magazines, music can cause children or adults to have a big imagination and as they grow or are thinking that its a right way to do things. All this things that are not for a proper use shoud be displade of were no children or adult have it in use. I believe that this can hust people as they grow up or adults thinking its the right way to do things. Books and music should be removed if not used for something that is in good use.      Books magazines that have no material use and its used for pornagrafi or something else should be taken off shelfs. Kids and as adults have a big imagination that could sometimes hurt others as well as family members. Book magazines and music provide imspiration not to come to the fact that it comes to peoples distraction.thesse are way that by sometimes not knowing u hurt ur love one because of what u see, read or hear.this can the be the biggest effects on people.      The supplies you get like books, magazine, and music arent helping you and are caousing more problems in your life they should be take of markets. Also people sometimes decied to buy them beacause of what the pictures have instored for you in a good day. another thing that causes them to be taken of shelfs is the thought that u can get by looking and hearin and reading.This are all bad things for anybody to be ready or lisening to.     I belive that books, magazines and music should be taken off because its nothing good for the brain and it dosnt help you in any way. Also things that arent used for good are not use full.In my opinion, I think that trashy books and music sometimes it can take you to suiside or into making something cazy that later on you will regret.This is why nun od thoese things are use full for a person or a child     In conclusion, I think that books, magazines and music that are not use full shoul be taken of shelfs and should be putting things that do help the mind.Things that are not resorsful for a person mind should be put away.All this things came into not having estability in life and cometing rong steps that take you into failure.Finaly I think that all unresorsful books, magazines and music should be put away",3,3
4294,"Freedom of speech and the freedom of press is a privelige we as @CAPS1 are lucky to have. I don't believe in censorship in libraries. Authors, publishers, editors, and directors all have a right to express their opinions in their work. If they would like to express some adult subjects in their work that is their choice. They have a right as people to protray their books, magazeines, and movies anyway they want.      We all have the choice to what books and movies we want to check out at libraries. Movies are required to have ratings so the audience knows the extent of the maturity you must have to watch the film. For example if you are a @NUM1 year old who wants to checkout a movie but, it's rated @CAPS2 that is not the best choice of movie. It @MONTH1 not be the best choice because movies rated @CAPS2 let the audience know its for a mature audience over the age of @NUM2.      As for books, I often use a book review website that allows me to see the content the book has. If I see that the book contains material I don't wish to read about or think the material is too mature, I don't read it. I hold the power to choose the books I read and the responsibility to choose the books best suited for my age and maturity level.      There are many ways we can track the content of the things we can checkout. Just because a movie or book is released doesn't mean we have to watch or read it. We all make choices in our everyday lives.Some are big and some are small. Picking a book or film to checkout from a library is a small choice, but it is our choice to choose what we can handle.      Author's, directors, and editors should not have their work punished if some people don't agree with the content they are putting in their material. Everyone's opinion varies on what's right and wrong. Therefore if you believe something is inappropriate you have the chocie of not reading or watching it.      I do believe we are lucky to have this freedom of opinion and speech. Although we shouldn't abuse it we must not forget we have no right to tell others how to use this freedom. As we have the choice to read what we want to, authors have a choice on what they want to write about. Libraries shouldn't take away this freedom that allows us to make our own decisions on what we view or read",4,4
4379,"There is many different topics that could be offensive, @CAPS5 just depends on the person's own personal judgement. In my opinion I do not believe that materials should be removed because not everyone has the same view or opinons. If someone comes from a different country or evern a different religion, topics like abortion and racism are going to be viewed very differently. I think having a variety of topics will help expand different thoughts and make the readers of the material see things in a different way.      When I am older and if one of my elementary children was to bring home a book over abortion, I would be concerned. Honestly though, I do not believe schools would let inapropriate topics for younger childeren read books like that. @CAPS5 is a little bit different with a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 student though. Their maturity level is going to be mature enough to handle the material and I do not think @CAPS5 is right for schools to remove something that could actually help someone.      In the book, 'A @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', there is a lot of detailed events that happen. Some might say @CAPS5 is too graphic for children but the reality of @CAPS5 is, events like those happen in today's society. @CAPS5 really opened up my eyes and I am extremely happy I read @CAPS5. The realization actually made me want to help those children who grow up in homes like the one described in the book. I believe @CAPS5 had the same effect on other people too and some children might even grow up to help others in that horrible situation.      Libraries should be able to have a variety of different books. I am not saying however that they should have books on murder and saying @CAPS5 is alright but books that will help expand the children's minds. @CAPS5 could even change their lives. Some books are a sensitvie topic but who has the right to tell someone something they should believe? @CAPS5 would mean more to someone if they found their own way and beliefs then having people tell them what they should and should not do or believe in.      I have also read a book recently titled, '@CAPS6', @CAPS5 is about the government granting the ability to @CAPS6 your children and then the body parts will go to those in need. @CAPS5 is sort of cruel in one way but the topic the author is trying to get across is not. A quote from the book is, 'On one side you have people killing abortion doctors for the right of life and on the other you have people getting pregnant just to sell their fetal tissue'. @CAPS5 states that everywhere you go people are going to disagree and agree on things but not everyone will believe in the same thing. @CAPS5 shows that just because one person thinks one way is right does not mean another will. The book changed my perspective on many different topics and helped me open my eyes on different views.      Racism, abortion, @CAPS3 abuse, unwinding your children, what ever the case @MONTH1 be, some people will support @CAPS5 and some will not. I think @CAPS5 is time for children around the world to discover for themselves what they truely believe in and taking 'offensive' material from @CAPS2 libraries is not going to help any. My opinion on this topic is strongly advising to leave the material alone because for there to be a book about @CAPS5, the author had to have had a reason to write @CAPS5 and honestly, what is better for the future then a generation of children grounded to their own true beliefs",4,4
4389,"I think that no source of knowledge should taken off any shelf in any librairy because a few people think it's offensive. In my own personal opinion someone could find a book offensive and another person could think it is reasonable. People can't make the judgment to say this is offensive to me so therefore it's offensive to everyone who reads it. Some of the best books on our shevles are the ones that @MONTH1 be offensive.     Some books are racist; Of @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 for example has some racist and sexist comments and remarks. If everyone got mad about that then a very good book wouldn't be read by the people who are going to run the country when i'm older. I know that all the older books would be gone to and then no one would know about what happened in the @NUM1's. Also some of the @ORGANIZATION1 shows people watch are ten times worse then the books people read,if you find a book offensive don't read it!     When i hear about a book being offensive it makes me want to read it. It gives the book charactor and makes it humorouse. We can't just have the same old books talking about the same old things because that gets boring after a while. Sometimes from thoughs books you even learn something about your self that makes you wonder if i didn't read this book would i still have found this out. Sometimes it brings out the best in people and thats the best part about reading a book like that.     Libraries are a place to go and look at all the books you could ever think of reading and no one should be able to take that away from people. I want my kids to be able to have the same options that i had growing up plus all the new books coming out. If you ask me it's just not right to take away someone elses choice of knowledge. Thats my personal opinion on taking books off the shelves of public libraries.",4,4
3504,"I think they should remeove it if the publick thinks its offensive. I think it should be that way about every thing. If something is offending you then you should say something about it. Im not saying that it will be takin care of all the time but you might get lucky and someone might fix it so your not offened all the time.      Growing up at home dad would always tell me if I didn't like something then don't do it, unless it was somethin that had to be done then I would have to do it. So when something happens that I don't like, I either change my ways or I aviode whatever it is. I rairly change my ways though. Some times that is a bad thing though, but who hasn't mad a mistake or two?      This is really hard for me to right about beacuse I don't care what other people think. So I really don't get offened. I do know some people the get offened easy though. I try to stay away from them beacuse you have to watch what you say all the time. To me thats no fun, I mean come on dude you have to be able to take a joke. If more people were easy going then I wouldn't be writing this essa. I bet there would be a lot less droma to but I dont know.     If you know of a book, movie, anything that will or might offened you, just dont read it again. It might not offened the next reader. They might really like the book or whatever it is. All you have to do is stay away from what ever it is that is bothering you. After a wile you will forget about it. I guess if it really really bothered you, and there was a lot more people that felt the same way about the same thing then yes remove it. If there is only a hand full of people saying they are offened then I would just tell them sorry but more people like it better so it will stay.",4,4
4692,"Is there a song that your parents wouldn't let you listen to when you were a child? When you sang this song did they yell at you and ground you because they had told you many times before that you weren't allowed to listen to it? How about a movie that you wanted to go watch because it was what everyone was talking about but it was rated @CAPS1 so you weren't allowed to watch it. That book on that shelf that you accidentally ran into while doing a research project. Containing inappropriate language and terms. There is much media and books that are out there that parents wouldn't want their children to read. But over all there is the government who censors things going on around the world. Censoring can have good and bad qualities.     In my experience I've noticed that people that know less tend to be more happy than people who know more. But if you are able to read and or watch these censored materials you would see the idea from a certain point of view, and maybe agree with the person. Most news is about things that are bad, rarely any good news comes around. For example if something were to happen in @LOCATION1, where thousands of people were being used to test if lions liked to eat humans, the government would censor the news to the people in their country due to any reason. If there was movie that was made that was racist against @CAPS2 people the government would probably censor it. Things that look bad tend to be censored.     I've noticed that people who read censored material feel special because they read or saw something that wasn't supposed to be known by the rest of the population. A lot more freedom of speech would occur if censored material wasn't censored. People also tend to become mad when they find out that material is being censored because they feel like something is being hidden for them, could be valuable information.     In reading I have noticed that societies that practice censorship tend to have angry citizens. But in the other hand if they believe that it's for the good of the society then they accept the fact that it's not good for them. People also want to be given the right to make their own decisons. In a censored civilizaton they have no idea what is going on outside their borders and are usually clueless or being lied to by their government.     Censorship can have good and bad qualities. People tend to be offended when material is censored, but it's probably for the best for them. Hidden information could be good and bad but mostly bad, most people want to know the truth rather than a lie. Censorship is just bad in general, people should have the right to make their own decisions on what they want to read or watch.",4,4
4423,"I think what ever is offensive should be taken off of the shelf because it is inoproperate. Books do not need to be like that because they are supposed to be fun for you and help you learn, yes you can have a little violence in an action/adventure book to get the mood of the character, setting of the story, and to understand it perhaps.     Offensive books can be okay at times, so if you have a comedy magazine, or book that is making fun of something or someone, it can be taken in a offensive way, or just a joke, and a none offensive way.     To most people they are going to want to take those kinds of books off of the shelf. Offensive books to them, such as parents or maybe even friends, they can teach a child wrong, and that child @MONTH1 not learn the right way. Kids when they are little, their brains are like sponges, so they learn, and remember stuff well at that age. A child getting a hold of a book or being tought something from a book like that will most likley remember it.     I think those kinds of books should be taken off of the shelf because, kids dont need to be reading that kind of stuff when its allready on television, and talked about. They need the edicational books that can teach them, and prepare them for their uppcoming higher grade levels, so then they would have a fresh start on new words or grammer.",2,3
4271,"My views on censorship are strong. I think that if a book, movie, ect. is descriminating towards one or more groups of people then I think that people should have the right to atleast have a say in wether it should be on the shelves of a library or not. Although books could be descriminating too, if the book it about something that has happened in the past and is the past of our country, then I think that people should also have a say in keeping it on the shelves.           If these materials are using offensive language or actions to harm or discriminate against that race then they should be taken off of the shelves. If they are part of the history of the world or of our country, then I think that they should be left there for future generations to learn about it and to know that these things happened. Most materials dont try to discriminate any race, and if they did, then I don't think it would be in the library in the first place.      For me, censorship could go both ways. It really just depends on the stuation and the material. Someone could have an opinion that it is offensive, but that doesnt mean that is a fact. If the book is popular in the library and a lot of people like to come in and read it, then I don't think I would remove the book. People view offensive writing and actions differently from one another. So, I think it depends on the situation.           If I was a parent these days, I would let my child read one of these so called offensive books if it was part of the past for our country. My attentions for letting him read it are for all the right reasons. I dont attend to let him read it so that he can act upon the things told about in the book. I would let him read it to learn about the past. I think it is a positive thing for children to know about the past.      So, in my perspective, censorship depends on the situation and the material. These are only my views on the topic, and also these statements are my opinion. So I can't really say if I am for censorship or not.",4,4
4275,"Imagine, you go into your favorite library and you go to grab your favorite book or movie and its not there. The librarian says the book was removed from all public libraries because it was found offensive.      Would this not get on your nerves? Especially if you had read the book yourself and found nothing wrong with it? Sure, there are some books that children should not be allowed to see due to offensive material; but why remove them completely? There are plenty of alternet solutions that could please everyone. Such as having a section only adults are allowed into, having a seperate public place for adults to get the books, movies, ect; and having signed permission from a parent or guardian saying their child could check out certain items.      The first solution is to have certain offensive material under lock and key from the public. If only the librarian had access to this material a child could not simply walk in and borrow what he, or she deems fit. The librarian would be the only one allowed to judge if the person, child or adult, could see this section of the librairy.     Next, there could be a totally separate building for the offensive material. Only people over @NUM1 would be let in and you would have to an i.d and a librairy card to get in. This would assure that no one uinderage could recieve or take anything that was deemed unfit.      My last solution is to have signed permission for anyone underage. When the child comes to get a librairy card the parent must be present and fill out an application saying what the child can and cannot check out.      I do not believe that books, movies, music, ect; should be removed from shelves. This directly goes against the first ammendment, free speech. If a person can say what someone else can or cannot read, see, or listen to whats to stop them from taking every @CAPS1 given right we have? Whats to stop them from censoring everything we write and say? Would you want to live in a world like that? I would most certainly not! However, I also believe that certain age groups should not be allowed to have access to certain material. I believe these are good altercations to prevent this from happening if only we take the steps to accomplish them",4,4
3637,"Should we have the right to be able to remove materials from shelves if they are found offensive? I believe that we should not have the right to be able to do this. I believe that if we had the right there would be no materials left for future children to read. A big thing to consider when you think about this right, is even though our materials speak of discrimination, or use a word that someone might find offensive, or even if we did not like the book, movie or magazine and thought that it was a waist of space. We should never have the right to be able to remove these materials.     I know of several people that think the harmless childs first book is trying to discriminate someone, or a race of people. There are books out there that are discriminating certain races of people, or informing us of a time when people were discriminated against. If we would have the right to remove these materials, all of them would eventualy be gone. Our future children wouldnt know that the event even happened or if they did half of their information would more than likely be wrong, since over years people would probably change the story to a version that they wanted their child to think.     If someone found one single word in the book or even a movie that they thought was offensive then they would have the right to remove the material from another persons view. If someone found a curse word in the material that they found offensive, or if they just find the idea of using curse words offensive they would be able have the material removed and that would mean that thousands of good books and movies would disappear for a word that one person did not like.     Some people might find them to be a waist of space and just remove it, if they did not like the book, movie, music or magazine. There are some people out there that like to read or listen to them and @MONTH1 find some of the them that we cant stand to look at, good or entertaining. Some people do not like a book by its size or by how big or small the words are. These arent ways to judge a book.     I think that nobody should have the right to remove a book, movie, music, or magazine from the shelf. We all should keep these materials as a reference to future generations. Past people in the world have destroyed materials that they didnt like, now we will never know what they were about or even trying to tell us. There is no reason to remove a material just for the oppinion of one person or even the oppinion a a group of people.",4,4
4515,"I agree with Katherine's statement, but to a certain extent. If a book or magazine has cursing or anything offensive in it, then a student should take it to the librarian and let him/her know they are offended by it. Especially if it's in a middle school or elementary school.      Of course there's going to be a book or movie or magazine that has something inappropriate in it. One day my friend and I were in the library looking for a book to read, and that's when I first discovered the @CAPS1 series. But as I got into the books, the more mature they got. In the last book, @ORGANIZATION1, it has a lot of profanity in it. But that doesn't mean I'm not mature enough to not know what it means. Same with any other high school student. But you can't protect your children from everything. Not even curse words.     So if you see a book at a local library that is absolutely filled with offensive things, and you decide you want it removed, just take it to your librarian and comfront him/her. I'm sure they'll understand. Or maybe they won't, and they'll wait to see if anyone else will want it removed. My point is, you can't always protect your children from violent words or movies, or magazines. But you can always stand your ground and try",3,3
4676,"OFFENSIVE BOOKS !!!   Did you ever think about why students read what they are ready now? They read books about sex , guns , and many more because they think its exciting well guess what its not! The author's who make them type of books want you to buy them because they want their money , but they never think about the kids. Kids would read anything now because of those kind of things.       I think that books like that should be removed because you dont want    your child to grow up reading those type of books then when they have kid  they wouldnt want the same. Many parents dont care what they chidren      read as long as they reading its fine with them , its not fine its very wrong and I wouldnt expect a great writer to use bad language also they think its okay to do that! Thats why kids act the way they do now is because of books , movies etc.      I think they should really stop making those books or have their own stores to where like adults can go buy those books or whatever books they want. I dont think kids would want to read those type of books anyway because they dont want to learn that stuff but some of them do and i dont think thats right at all. Thats why kids should read a very good book and dont judge a book by its cover !@NUM1",3,3
3663,I dont think there should be any censorship good books and music shouldint be removed just becaus one person finds it offensive. Becaus the opinion's of one @MONTH1 be diffrent with another.I beleave music is cencord the most becaus  not many people get offendid by books but censorship in music i think is destroying it.Becaus its an artists way of expresion and if people dont wana listen to what there saying then they should just not listen to it.Books i think shouldint be taken offensivly forthe same reason music shouldint its a writers oppinion and expresion its like telling someone they cant voice there oppinion on anything like racesim or use curse words if they want.,2,2
3051,"The library is a pathway to knowledge, which branches to many different cultural roads. It has expanded from just a place of books to a building which also houses music, movies, magazines, and other forms of media. But, there begs the question if certain materials should be excluded if they deemed to be offensive. There are many ways to approach this question.     Is censorship an answer to offensive materials or an answer to what is not 'politically correct'? Often, people will claim certain work to be unjust without understanding the viewpoint of the supposed victim. It is quite ironic that the people with the power - who stand up for offended parties - often do not understand them more than the creator of the work.      Another reason for censorship is to protect children from unwanted material, which is very understandable. But, where in the process do parents have control of what exactly they want their children to access. I believe it is the resposiblity of the parent to determine such restrictions. If a parent gives a child unlimited access to material at a library, then the child should be able to explore wherever their curiosity takes them. If the parent chooses to limit access, then they should be active in the process of selection. It is the right of the individuals who birthed and raise these kids to determine how they are guided.     I myself am a musician, which is no more artistic in a sense than any other creator, such as an author. My creations are expressions that I give for world to enjoy and think about. To remove the work of an author in a library is to damage his ability to spread his thoughts. Of course, there are other outlets to acquire books, but the library is one of the greatest outlets.     There are a couple complications that will arise in censorship on libraries. What guidlines do you have in determing excluding the offensive materials? If a material offends one person, is that sufficient enough to exclude it, or do you need a larger group? It is unrealistic to always get a complete consensus of a group's opinion, so how do you determine whats offensive and whats not.            In all, I believe that everybody should have the ability acquire whatever material they want from a library. It is an institution that is allows one to go places that they will never go and live lives they never will live. Its ability to do such should not be compromised.",4,4
3602,"I believe there should not be censorship in libraries, because if some needs to read a book about somthing and the library does not have it beacuse they do not believe or like what the book as to say it makes the reader not know what actually.     The very first reason in believe there should not be any censorship in librarys is beacuse a lot of student go there to study about papers.So if the library does not have the book that a student is looking for the library is failing its maine purpose.           The sencond reason is that if the person in chage of the library does not like a book that does not mean he or she has to read the book books are ment for any one and everyone to read.      Then the third  is that a library is ment to have books so people can read them so if the owner takes the book out and some need that one book and the person can not get the information that they neeed out of that one bookthe library is faling its maine purpose.     The fourth reason is that alot of people read books to read about something and just beacuse he or she does not like what the book has to say does not give them the right to take the book.      Those are the three mane reasons i think librays should not have censorship. The owner of the library should have any book possibel and should not shose to not put a book in it beacuse he ore she does not like what the book says.",3,3
4506,"Censorship in libraries has been a major concern in school systems for many years. In many school libraries certain books, music, movies, and magazines have been removed because of the content in them. These items can be removed for these common types of content wich include, use of violence, sexual acts, drug use, and inapropriate language. Many parents of young kids are always wondering what their kids are doing at school. Most parents would not want to find out that their kids are being introduced to such things at a young age, because it could influence them to participate in these activities.     In my opinion I do believe that certain material in school libraries should be removed but not in public libraries because a public library can be divided into sections depending on age groups. Inn elementry and middle school libraries, items should be censored because young students do not need to be introduced to things that are inapropriate or violent in anyway. In a school environment kids should only be introduced to drug use, and sexual activity through some sort of health class because there is where they will learn the true facts and it would be more educational for them, rather than hearing about drugs, sex, and violence in a song or seeing some form of it in a movie.     Many kids watch movies that have very violent, and inapropriate scenes, and some of the songs in the world today are exstreamly inapropriate for young kids. Their are also many books and magazines that should not be read by young students at school because of the content in them, this is why I do believe that censorship in libraries is a great thing.",3,3
4684,"People in this common era have different appproaches to the idea of libraries.  Some view the library as a place to go and learn and to express yourself and be free.  Others believe it to be a place where there is danger for minors and can be very innapropriate.  These two opinions can cause an intriguing argument.     People go to the library because they want to either get away, or just to be free and grab a nice book.  There are many books to choose from, but you need to be careful while browsing.  some books, although good, can be innapropriate to some ages, and that's when controversy spills.  Parents think the library is encouraging the check-out of innapropriate books, but this isn't all that true.  It's all about the placement of books, and that's what most librarians will tell you.  They didn't encourage the kid to check it out, but they have every right to.  It is also unknown that what is offensive to one person, might bring joy to another person maybe of a different race or ethnic background.     I think that these so-called offensive books or magazines that parents complain about, should not be removed from libraries.  There is a reason those books are there and they are not put up there to be offensive; so why take them down?  I think a way we can monitor these kids to stay away from books their parents believe can be harmful to them is by making a rule stating that a child must be present with an adult in certain sections.  This will not only stop the fact that kids checkout books much innapropriate for them, but it might also make the parents stop complaining and the controversy will end.          People need to stop looking at the library as a place that brings negativity, but as a place for giving children joy.  Remember, it was built for those who enjoy reading and so people can have a place to do so.  Why complain? Find the positives in what it brings instead of looking down on it.  Bring back the feelings of what the library brought to you when you were a child.",4,4
4491,"Throughout history their have always been those who have refuted the beliefs and ideals of others. Whether that be in @LOCATION1 when statues were censored by removing anything deemed offensive by the @CAPS1 church or the mass burning of books to preserve ideals that could invalidated through the clear spoken text. However this in not the @DATE1, women are not looked down upon anymore, science is not dillouted, and ideas are free throughout the world with the internet. So is it the libraries fault for providing uncensored content or is the parents fault, for not educating their children on the morality of such items?     The modern library has very specific demographics for all items to which it posses. Movies over @CAPS2 attract both parents and teenagers alike, the music entices the teenagers, and the books and prior two media sources attract younger children. So how would it be fair to force a library to censor two of the things that earn the library the most money just so that kids don't read,watch or hear them. Plus libraries generally don't let young kids check out @CAPS3 rated movies or parental advisory @CAPS4.     Some people however argue that books are the most dangerous thing to children and young adults. As books can raise ideas and strengthen them in a teens mind over the course of @NUM1 pages till parents end up with an anti-sematic teen with bad view on racism. So then why would that be the fault of the library as it merely provided one book that should not have affected that teen so much, had that teen had solid moral beliefs instilled in him or her from their parents.     So if you find materials at a library offensive, or worry about your child going there, there's always an easy solution. Don't go their and don't let your child go their. However if you see the beauty in impurity that a library brings to a community and to a person as I do then don't allow the injustice to authors, songwriters, musicians, directors, and yourself occur.",4,4
3815,"In many libraries there are books, movies, magazines and much much more. Some of these items though are seen as inappropiate for certain ages. I believe though that every customer in the library should have the ability to choose what they want to read. It is up to the parents or the child to decide what they want in their heads.     Let us start with books. There are many different types of books. From scientific data about human anatomy to dragons and vampires. How can you choose a book that is deemed appropiate for you though? The answer is simple. When you are younger, your parents help you choose the right books to read and as you mature, you begin to make thoses choices yourself. It is up to you whether or not you should read a certain book.      Movies guidelines are along the same pattern. Your parents helped you choose appropiate movies in your youth. When you grow up, you learn to read about the movie, and look at the rating. If it seems to intimadating, or innapropiate, or violent, you make the choice to see it or not.      Sometimes you see offensive material in movies or books. If you dissaprove of it strongly take the dilemma to the librarian. Discuss why you think the movie/book is unnappropiate and offer some ideas on how to deals with the situation. Some suggestions could be: to remove the item from the shelf, or to write and extra review on the book, or write to the author/movie director. The simplest solution though is to just leave the offensive item alone. If it offends you, just send it back to the library and warn your friends not to check it out. Others @MONTH1 still enjoy the item even though you don't.          There are many books, movies, magazines, etc. out in the world. Some @MONTH1 be deemed as innapropiate or offensive. There are many other choices that are 'okay'. So if you don't approve of a certain book, just send it back to the library and find one you do like.",4,4
2998,"Dear news people,     I am qriting to you because I have my own answer on what people should do with books. I think it is ok for people to write whatever thay want because it's a free contruy to where you can do anything that you tink you can do. What I am trying to say is that people can write books how ever thay want with anything in it such as drugs, sex, abuse, bad language, and so on you get what I'm saying. I think it's ok to write whatever they want and put whatever it was they wrote about on the shelf. It's they person who is picking a book choose to read a book just because they don't like what the book was about they don't have to make a big deal about it and cause a problem. People can just not pick the book up and look for another book.     I don't think it's fear that people should make a big deal out of a book that they don't have to read at all it makes no since to me and I bet a lot of people would agree. If I was someone who was a aganised stuff like sex, and drugs and I saw it in a book I would just set it down and look for a book that I would agree with than causing a problem like others would. It just is not fare and it's a waist of time to me if someone has to complane about something so dumb.     So to rap this thing up I think people who don't like the way books are writen should just put it down and not worry about it and buy a book that they feel better off with reading. There is no point to waist time and cause a problem that's my oppion about this problem hope it is yours to.",3,2

Also i dont think a book will ever really hurt anyone. I mean its just a book it dose not really matter.     Next, i am saying this becuse i dont really would get offensive to stuff like this argument. And also if there some stuff that kids shouldnt know about then they should  put those stuff in the adult section and not a place where they can find it easy. They shouldn't put stuff that you think children should never know about in the kids section.     Matter of fats i don't know why they should  remove stuff like movie. Becuse if they are trying to block them form kids to see they are really dumb to do that. Beause there are moive that children can watch. And some parents is not going to let their children watch a @CAPS1 @NUM1 movies, and other movie they were not to see at there ages. Unless if their parents allowe it.And that goes with the same with the music.

3770,"Censorship is a very sensitive topic. Everyone has to deal with censroship whether it is directly or indirectly. There have been many complaints and arguments involving the government regarding acts of censorship throughout the past. If censorship were to be equal for everyone, there would be nothing left in the world to be censored.     Censorship is a major subject when dealing with books, newspaper articles, movies, and other literary subjects. The writer or director must be able to create an interesting topic or story line while at the same time keeping it appropriate for most audiences. If everyone were to censor one piece of literature or film that offended them in a certain way, then everything in life would be censored in one way or another. No matter what, there will always be a certain situation in which one person in the world will be offended by. Censorship is wrong, especially in the @LOCATION1; the @LOCATION1 citizens are granted the freedom of speech and the freedom of press. With an understanding of these basic freedoms, one would think that censorship is against the law considering it is one of the five basic freedoms granted to @LOCATION1 citizens. Censorship is wrong because it violates at least two of the five basic freedoms granted to all @LOCATION1 citizens. There should be absolutely no censorship when dealing with books, movies, and newspaper articles, because they all deal with the freedom of speech, or the freedom of press. If the act of censorship begins to expand, everything we know today will become censored in some manner just because one person would find it offensive.      Some citizens @MONTH1 argue that censorship is a positive thing because it filters out all of the inappropriate, offensive, and derrogatory language and situations from our nation's youth, but from a teenager's standpoint, the children will find out about such situations and language use regardless. There is no point in hiding the truth from anyone, because no matter what they will find out eventually. We need to push for less censorship in the @LOCATION1, because if we want to keep our five basic freedoms of life granted to us by the first amendmant, then we need to fight back censorship and remove it completely from our society",4,4
3370,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' - @PERSON1     If one thinks about it books are such a magical escape from everday life. They can take one anywhere they want to go at anytime. Imagine a world where books are a luxury or where they are simply not present at all.I feel as if this would become an all too real reality if we censor books.      Where would the line be drawn saying a book is unfit to be @CAPS5 or placed into circulation. This would hold the world back since we could not express ourselves through our writing. So much would be left unsaid. I believe the quote stated above is quite true. If we place censorship on one book everyone has a right to ban other books as well. Just because certain books, movies, and magazines are deemed offensive to some, does not mean they should be banned for all. No one should we withheld from a book due to age, race, gender, or any other factor.      If one has ever been prohibited from doing something due to age or size the feeling is not pleasant.No one neccessarily said anything mean or hurtful it just feels as if restritions and boundaries were set for no particular reason. I have felt this way multiple times. I remember one time in particular. I went to @LOCATION1 with a group of my cousins and their friends. Since I was the youngest I was also the shortest. I could not ride many of the rides there due to my size. I knew why those heighth requirements were set, for my personal safety. This makes sense, but why should one be required to be a certain age to watch a movie or watch a tv show. Honestly some people are more mature than others and grow up faster. Everyone is different. Everyone has a different personality and different perspective, there is no need to ban a book for everyone when we are all different. One should not be ineligible to @CAPS5 a book or magazine or watch a movie. Not wanting to is totally differnet from not getting to.       The popular book To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 was banned at one time in the @LOCATION2 simply for using the 'n-word'. This angers many especially when one ponders how much slavery as well as the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 affected and shaped us into who we are today. America is a great nation because of the @ORGANIZATION1.Do we need to have a @ORGANIZATION1 to @CAPS5!Why should we restrict ourselves and limit our own personal freedoms?  If anything is to be banned, I believe it is censorship",4,4
3125,"Libraries have tons of books from comedy all the way to violent.Some people like reading books about war and violence while others find it offencive. No matter what the book is about people have the choice to read them or not so why should libraries have to remove books that some might find offensive? They shouldn't! Every one has different views on ideas, and not everyone is alike. If all the books that were offencive to someone where takin off the shelf, there would be no more books left.     People walk into the library and most of the time books are labled by what they are about. They walk to the section they like and pick out a book and normaly don't go to the section that they don't like. There is no reason to go to the section that they dont like becasue they wont be reading a book from there becasue they dont like it. They would just cause problems and disturb the ones that do enjoy reading those types of books. People have the choice to read a book or not so why bother even worry what other people are reading as long as they are happy with what thye have. If a parent does not want a child to read a certain type of book that is their buisness but other parents might want their child to soo what all is out there and develope their child's views on subjects.     Everyone has different views and ideas. If every one was the same the world would be boring and there would be notheing to talk about. By reading different types of books and listening to different types of music there is always somthing to talk about becasue not everyone knows the same subjects. Reading a new kind of book might even open people's eyes to what differences there are in the world. Children often times are more open to different ideas than adults are so if the books are not there for children to try and read they will never know what they like and do not like. A book a child likes @MONTH1 not be that a nother child likes or even an adult likes but that is normal, people are not the same.      If everyone took the books or music off the self that they found offensive there wouldn't be very much of anything left on the shelves. Styles are most the time oppisits, like comedy and sad books. Most poeple who would like comedy wouldn't like sad and visa-versa there fore they would take the other off the shelf so neither would have anything to read or listen to. Even with some of the best selling books poeple wonder why or how so many sold but thats just how it is. People out there like the book so if one person didnt like it all those people would never have known what that book is about and @MONTH1 have changed their life. Books can be very impactfull in people's lives and if they never read that book the change would never have been made to their life.The world goes round becasue of differences and the world becomes a better place because of different ideas. everyone cannot be the same it just would not work.      Libraries should not have to take books off the shelf just because someone found it offensive or did not like it. People have the choice to read books or not and different views and ideas are good to make things more interesting. Moreover, if everyone tooks books and music off the shelves they did not like there would not be very many books and music left. So if you run into a book or some music you dont like just ignore it, dont read it or listen to it. Things will be much simpler in the long run.",4,4
4472,"Books are part of history no book should be censored.  They show and teach us about history.  If the book is based on true events nothing should be censored.

Its just like saying all websites should be cenerosed.       A book that needs to be censored should not be in an @CAPS1 school.  I would have to say any book that teaches a lesson or helps a teacher should be used no matter the content in it.  This is why a teacher needs to read the book before assigning it the students.  If he/she thinks the students will not act apporiate, then the book should not be used in the class room.  A lot of books would be removed or cenersored from shelves.       If you do not want to hear those words or see certain images you should not have gotten that book. Many people would be made mad if this did happen.  I would be two because sometimes a whole chapter could be bad or in music a whole lyric could be bad.  Many people are mad now, but everyone else would be mad if censerorship happened",3,3

My view on censorship in libraries would have to be that those bad sections should be off limits to childeren. All libraries are divided up in to different sections like; fiction, non- fiction, fantasy, children's books. Those sections were created for a reason. If people choose to let their children read books then that is fine with me. Although those parents that do not approve of this can go to a different library. I feel that if that one parent complains and no one else has that they should not be allowed in that library anymore.     I do not beleive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc should be excluded  from a library. Just because, a person does not appreciate their child picking up a book they should not have. I feel that parents should be responsiable for what their kid's are looking at, and not make libraries take books off their shelves. Everything from books to movies were put in the libraries for educational reasons. Their should be  laws that say those things are put into a library for a certain reason, and if customers do not like that they can go some where's else.         My own experience being a volunteer at a local library is that there are many things that were put into a libray for a reason. Every movie, book, and magazine have information about something that you @MONTH1 want to know. Books are put in  libraries for people's pleasure and love for reading. All those types of books are made from people that find excitement in reading. Movies at a library are put their for educational reason  like: to teach kids to count, and to learn something about a certain topic. Magazines could just be in a  library for people to read and relax, and learn something new in the world.     I really feel that parent's should watch what their children are reading, you should think the same. Library's should not have to remove books from their shelves that have been there for a really long time. Materials like movies, books, magazines, and music should never be taken away from a library. What would be the point in having a library around if you could not go check a book , movie or cd out that interest's you. After reading this should feel the same, that certain thing should not be removed from a library because parent's do not know how to watch their children",4,4
4523,"Libraries are filled with books, magazines, music, movies, and many more materials. All of the materials cover a really wide range of topics. For example, movies can be a comedy, mystery, or adventure. However, some of this material is not suitable for some viewers and can be very offensive to them. For this reason, these offensive materials should be removed from libraries.     One reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because it can lead to violence in teenagers. If a teenager is continually reading books or watching movies that have violence in them, then they might think violent behavior is all right. They might not know that violence is not the answer to many problems, and they will not realize that there are other solutions to a problem.      One case that proves seeing offensive material can lead to violence occurred in a high school. A straight-A student got a grade she thought she did not deserve from a teacher. This student then painted her face white, put on red lipstick, and took a knife to the teacher's classroom during school. She then proceded to threaten to kill the teacher. She got the idea from the movie '@CAPS1', and her costume resembled the @CAPS2. Some students in the classroom at the time called @NUM1, and the police officers convinced the girl to put down the knife. Maybe if she had not seen the movie she would not have threatened to kill her teacher.     Another reason offensive material should be removed from libraries is because the material is sometimes inappropriate for younger children. The children might just be looking at books and magazines in the library and not even check it out. This way no one will know that they read it. Some of the books in libraries have subjects like sex and drugs in them. When the child reads this, he might want to do everything that is in the book. I have  read a book that contains sex and drugs. The book might put awful ideas into the child's head if he read it.     After all is said and done, offensive material should be removed from libraries. The material can lead to violent acts in people, even if it does not seem like that kind of behavior could possibly come out of that person. The material can also be inappropriate for younger children. All in all, material in libraries can be offensive to some people.",4,4
3772,"I belive that everyone has there own appioin on whats appropreate, and whats not. You can't @CAPS4 taske a couple people and ask there oppinon because everyone is differant, we all have our owne rights to know books and what the aurthor realy wanted us to learn or here about. Like i said everyone is differant if you @CAPS6't want your @CAPS1 to read it tell your @CAPS1 why and explain it to them. @CAPS6't make the rest of the @CAPS1 suffer.         I belive some parents need to look at our ansatre there wernt even aloud to have dreams and thoughts. Why would we want our @CAPS1 to go threw the same thing they had to, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 everyone shopuld have a right to look to read listen to what ever makes them happy, So what if i has volger launguage in it get over it or @CAPS6't listen to it all.            Would you want someone telling you that your life story for example was crummy and diddent like the way you worded things. Thats the way you talk it's because it's your life story. The way i see it is let our children of this generation learn all they can about the bad stuff so they can stay away from it and also infor them of the good stuff in life so there won't allways be in fear. Let the chinlden read what ever they want to read. So what they curse tell your @CAPS1 that its bad launguage. @CAPS6't get ride of good books movies music.(@CAPS3:) @CAPS4 because the Author has a diff veiw on life than yours. Open your @CAPS5, @CAPS6't be so shallow",3,3
3260,"'@CAPS1, @CAPS1, @CAPS1 I like @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and I can not lie, when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waste and a round thing in your face you get sprung.' @CAPS2 song in itself depicts a rather provocative tone towards women and men. While '@CAPS3 a'las what sorrows can be seen over yonder' tells us that love can be found anywhere. Now look closly at both lymrics you will eventually see a connection in both. The rap song @CAPS4 @CAPS5 is about a man that finds love in large glutius maximi while the other says that love can be seen everywhere, and anywhere.     To say that music, magazines, books, and more should be banned is to say that throwing an @CAPS6 flag on the floor is just okay. Well its not; banning books, music, etc. is just like cencoring someones imaginationa and creativity. It is just like the book @DATE1, where @CAPS4 @CAPS8 is watching, and that we are only based on what we are allowed to read, and even think. Taking away movies and books, is to not allow people to learn from their past.     Take @CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 for example, though that movie is rather gory and morbid, it still tells us of the horrors of the time during @CAPS12 @CAPS13 @NUM1 and that the past is never something that should be let go. Always remeber the past so you can learn from it. Had that movie been cencored or removed I personally would have never learned about the hardtimes of the @CAPS13 and what it can do to a persons soul and emotions.     A book, magazine, movie, etc are all gateways to new worlds, where children can use their imagination and justify what their personality is. I can say that books and songs have saved lives. The other day a friend of mine was on the edge of suicide and was almost a squeeze away from pulling the trigger when I told him that what he was doing was wrong. I was @NUM2 at the time, and i rushed through my ipod to find a song '@CAPS14 to @CAPS15 a @CAPS16' by the @CAPS17. I basically read him the lyrics and he eventually put the idea of sucicide away.     While yes, there aresongs & books like The @CAPS18 and the @CAPS19 that @MONTH1 have provoked people to do crazy things, even to kill. We stilll see more good being done and shown through reading and writing. Because they are all ways to express ourselves. A song can @CAPS15 a @CAPS16 as much as it can take one away. Even then we can that letting imagination flow is better than letting the imagination get cencored. If a book is seen as something unwanted or taken away, it will cause more harm in that it would be wanted more, it would be craved becasue it is an unreachable thing",4,4
4348,"I disagree with library censorship. Every person should be allowed to produce their reflection of their believes or ideas. If certian books found offensive were to be removed from libraries then there would be nothing left for anyone to read.     If parents are concerned with what their children are checking out from the library to read then they should read it before their child to see if they think it is appropriate. In my opinion children should be able to read what ever they like and by doing that they can teach themselves many things.     Books can also help children to escape from every day life.Admitedly, children should not always escape, or use reading to hide from real life, but occasionaly they need too. I know as a young child when things were not going so well I could always turn to reading to get my mind off of the bad things. If children are allowed these escapes they can do better on their school work and with their peers.     Reading can help a child to expand their imaginations. If a child reads a couple times a day it is proven that said child will do better in life. No one likes boring people, and how can you be boring with such a wide imagination?  It is impossible!     In recent online polls, parents who's children can access books say that their children to better in school and in every day life. By reading, these children can easily expand their vocabularies. With this knowlege they can learn with less difficulty and can excell in acedemics with ease.     In conclusion, If certian books are censored from the libraries they will be inavailable for children to read. Children need books to provide an escape, to expand their imaginations, and to help them in school and life. Do not let libraries censor books!",3,4
3048,"I believe that all the books are meant to be in the library. People would not want them gone if they thought of it the way I do. It makes sense that we need all sorts of books to learn from. Some books @MONTH1 seem bad, but when you think about it there is always a good lesson to be learned. There are many different reasons why all books should stay on the shelf, but here are a couple of mine.     Two years ago there was a boy named @PERSON1. On many occations he found himself in bad situations that he did not know how to deal with. Many parents do not talk to their kids about certain things, such as drugs. This makes kids unaware and curious to figure out the truth. He had no other way of figuring out about how to handle fights, drugs, and alcohol unless he read about them in a book.      When he was almost sixteen years old he began to hang out with a bad group of teenagers. They were going to take @PERSON1 to a party. @PERSON1 secretly left his house and went because he was curious. When he got to the party, everybody began to drink. He knew that he always wanted to try it, yet he was not going to because he had to be home before his parents got up at five the next morning.      After several hours of setting on a couch watching everybody else do it, they finally had him talked into it. He figured that one would not hurt. Well before long, one became two, two became four, and it just kept going up. @PERSON1 was having so much fun that he lost track of time. He looked at the clock and it was three a.m., he got really worried.     He didn't know what to do until he thought back to a book he read. The book was about a guy who was out drinking, the guy had know other way home than to drive. The guy decided he would just drive home because he was not very drunk. When he was driving home he pulled out on a highway at the wrong time. A semi hit him in the left side of his car.       After thinking about that book he decided to be brave and call his parents. @PERSON1 knew that he would get punished, but he decided that grounding would be better than injury, or even death. @PERSON1 had his dad come get him from the party. He was grounded for two months. It would have been longer if his parents had not been so proud of his decision in the end. @PERSON1 was happy with his decision as well.     Events such as that are the exact reason why I think that almost any book belongs on the shelf. The story in wach book helps everybody comprehend what should be done in a real life situations. I know that books help me figure out many things. Even what to do and what not to do. If you just give every book a chance you will find a good reason for it to be read",3,3
3283,"i think that the libraries in generally shouldn't take themusic,movies, or the magazines away. Because you never know what goes on at there home and they just want to get   away and relax the self at the library to read. I think that they shouldn't take the books off the the shelves just for a reason because people love going to the library.And if they don't have those things then what the point of going there.my other thing that they shouldn't take those things away is thatthey will not make a profit. when the people go to the libraryand they dont see those things they are going to wonder want happen.i think that it shouldn't be the children fault that all of the books are gone. It should be the owners and the people that work at the library fault that they made them take the booksoff the shelves.I also think that when the children goes to the library they are going to ask there parent or someone.Where are the book because they want to read and also where are the book so they can check them out.But the people would want to keep getting the books from the library to check them out.I think that the people should not take the books off the shelves for a specific reason and that reason is that people and children would go like on a weekend to read if they dont have any of those things at home.My thing is that they shouldn't just remove anything at all because it going to be a big commotion. So  by removing all of  that would be sad because what if no one has no place to go and they are feeling loney and they want to go the library and read. but my whole point agbout it is that who came up with no books,music or magzines on the shelves.But i also think that if they did that in the real world. Then it would be terrible and a crisis to the people.I think that they should not do that because the people love to read listen to music and etc. I also think that they should not do that because people love going to to releave some stress that they might have and they jus want to go there.I also think that they might not do it anyways because they know the people love there jobs to not to.One of the things that i like is that when i go to the library it is nice and quiet and we can listen to our ipod or our @NUM1 player something like that.Some people just love to go so that they can see there friends and communicate with them to get on the computer. My reason is that they shouldn't do that is they can lose everything like there jobs and etc.",3,3
4545,"The question was asked 'Do you believe certian matierals, such as books, music, movies, moagazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive,' No! By taking away these things, such as books, music, magazines, or movies off the self, that @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' your taking away things that people enjoy. Not many people including me would agree with the passage of censorship on items like these. So should we do this, I dont believe that we should. There are many reasons that this should not be passed.     First by using this censorship, you might lose more customers in that store selling these such items. Once the store has lost customers, they lose money, then they might even lose their store. A lot of people like things that dont have any limits to them. They often find their joy in these things. I know that i, myself like reading books, listening to music that has no limits. So if your taking them away or puting limits to it, are people really gonna want to have these things?     Secondly, if there is really an issue with books and etc, that are not suitable for kids, then put the books and etc,  in catogories. These catorgories would put the things not suitable for children, apart from the ones that children should be reading. Since there are no real solutions besides banning these items, this would be the best plan.      Finally, as katherine paterson stated 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self.' If this is really a problem then the the parents need to watch what their child is reading, because it isn't right to have everything taken away from the society just because the parents are concerned with what their child is reading.      So what do you think, should this be such a law. The choice is yours. Just remember though, if you agree with this then. Just think of everything you are taking away from other people, do you really want to be that heartless?",4,4
4008,"First,I do not think the libraries should take all of those thinks because some of those things people need to help them with their work.when some people need music to think and maybe somepepple need magazines.so I do not think the libraries should take the items off the shelves.",2,2
4614,"Offensive articles and or movies and magazines etc should not be pulled from shelves.  If individuals choose to read and/or watch the material that is their personal choice  @CAPS1 I think there should be an age limit for the material.  If individuals find the material offensive they should turn their back and not read or watch the programs.  If the items are in a public library they should be kept in a separate area for those who wish to view them.   They should not be kept in the open for small children or for people who do not wish to see them.        Historic material such as diaries and accounts of events should be held at federal libraries.   Having these documents in a public library could interest small children in reading  things that are inappropriate for them.   Certain items such as magazines, and newspapers and books, some of these items are held at a public level.   Governement affiliated documents should be held at a federal library such as parts of history and important documents.   High profile documents such as the constitution should be held in high security areas.        In conclusion people who wish to view certain material should be able to do so as I had previously stated.   They should not be out in the open for small children.   It should be held in a separate area   If people do not wish to view this material they simply do not go in that area.    Having an age limit in place for this material is key so that small children do not view it and get the wrong message.   Having certain doements in public and certain documents in federal libraries is a factor.   Certain historical doeuments and other items that are affiliated with the government should be held at a federal level as well as important documents related to the country.  These documents should be high profile secure areas",3,3
3491,"I personally dont think there should be any censorship in books coming into a @CAPS1. I think its wrong to do so, because any book should be read know matter what is said in it. Anyone who has a problem with something should just not read it and leave it alone.      Now ive not really seen anything that i'd fine offensive, but ive read somethings with words i was sort of was suprised to see. But nothing that i found offensive personally. Books are there for their own purpose, and thats another reason why authors put them out there for the public to think what they want of it.",2,2
4152,"I certainly don't believe books, magazines, etc.. should be taken off the shelves in libraries just because they're offensive to a certain amount of people. For one of the reasons are in the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 it states that you have the freedom of speech and when you write a book or an article in a magazine you are writing a story on whatever you want and if it is put on a shelf in the @CAPS1 place it should stay there. Also, just because it is offensive to one certain group or person doesn't give anybody the right to take something off the shelf in the library because the author is speaking what they want.     Also in magazines today there are many offensive things to certain people such as celebrities, sports stars, etc... but they don't go to the libraries and take them off the shelf. If you were one of those people that did take a book or magazine off the shelf I think you should ask other people what they think about that material, because some people @MONTH1 like it. Also if you keep taking all the books off the shelf what will we have to read and educate ourselves about today, and read stories that were told for generations? If you do see one of those reading materials and they are offensive to you just put it back up on the shelf; and act like you never picked it up.",3,3
3368,"Isn't  it shocking that some books, music, movies and magazines you find on your library shelf today aren't appropriate for the little ones. I believe that if you have to question whether a child should be listening or viewing this item then it shouldn't be in or around a child section at all. Some content could be offensive to not just children but also to teenagers and adults.      Some music @MONTH1 contain words that are children shouldn't be exposed to. Music such as hip/hop and rap @MONTH1 contain degrading comments to men and/or women. I wouldn't want my child listening to this type of music, or reading any book that talks about it. Music @MONTH1 also be offensive to cultures, religion, sexual orientation and race. Books or music with comments such as that should have notes written on them stating what they contain. I was reading a book called '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', that i had picked up in the child section. After the first chapter I had wondered who who call this a children book. The character was using profanity and talking about sex the whole time. My child shouldn't be looking for a book on pie then find out its not about pie.     I once was watching a movie with my two year old that we got from the library. The movie was full of inappropriate words, therefore I had to shut it off. Movies like that should not be on the shelf at the library for my child to view. I now have to worry about what we check out. I also have had a few bad reading experiences. Magazines is a big one. Some magazines @MONTH1 contain content such as innappropriate pictures and words. Magazines should stay at the grocery store rather then a library that I take my child to.     Books, music, movies and magazines should stay out of the childrens section if they are only meant for adult viewing keep them in the adult section. Any parent would tell you that they don't agree with some of the stuff on your local library shelf today. Offendsive content shouldn't be found in the library at all. I know now to keep a better eye on what my child is reading.",4,4
4192,"I believe books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. should be removed from the lilbrary if they are offensive. Some peole take things wrong and lilbraries could have issuses. Also keeps customers happy and it will get ou more guests daily. Lastly, it might let someone feel better about themselves.   First, some people will take things wrong and lilbraries will have issuses. If someone comes into the lilbray in feel its something in the lilbrary that is offensive you can get a lawsuite. Also it could set off anyones mind to feel disrepsected and feel they dnt have to respect the lilbrary because the library isnt respecting them. It can cause plan in someones eyes by making them feel like they arent equal around other people.   Second, it keeps customers happy. If a customer feel that they see something offensive and the lilbrary discards of the object it will make them feel that you respect them. If you keep offensive things in a llbray less people will cum to the lilbrary if they feel they are offended and have no say in if it should be removed. The more people feel home bond the more they will come.   Next, it might let someone feel better. If you walked into the lilbrary and seen something you didnt like in there you would want it removed too. If it didnt get removed you would feel that you are not respected and you will feel not wanted. Lets say someone see something offensive and the lilbrary doesnt remove it and the person took a book out the lilbrary, then never returned it you would lose money because you would have to get new books in stock.   In @CAPS1, there are many ways to resolve problems and resolve issuses without conflict. You can disrespect someone and they might disrespect you back, but when it all come down to it you have to give repsect to get it. somethings help people feel better about themselves and keep there day goin.

4479,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' wrote by Katherine Paterson. If you think about it when you go into a library there is a ton of books to choose from. But how many do you think is appropiate for every age and including children, not very many. That is why they have sections for the books, but there are times people are rude and mix them up on purpose.          How many times have you been in a library and find a misplaced book? Many of times right, that can be accidental or on purpose. I know if I took my child or children to a libraby and they got a book that was inappropiate for them, I would take it to the front desk and complain about that book. Now if it was a book that has been misplaced I would take it from them. But, yes there are some books, magazines, movies, and music that should be removed from the libray.      I remember from when I was a little girl going into the library to check out books with my mom or my dad, it did not matter they both enjoyed taking me to the library. They were pleased that I loved to read but, one day my mom took me to get books from the library, she did not think about looking at the books I got until we got home and she realized on of my books had a cursing word in it. She was not happy at all, I had no clue what she was doing. But I figured it out, she grabbed me by my hand and took me to the car. She fastened me in and off we went, back to the library. She had no problem going off and complaining, I can remember her every word she said it sounded like this. '@CAPS1, my name is @LOCATION2 and this is my daughter @PERSON2 she is six years old. We were just her about an hour ago, but you want to know the funny reason we are back. Well if you can give me a funny reason for why my six year old daughter has a childs book from here with cursing in it. Please speak up and explain I would love to hear it.' The lady at the front desk was stunned she has never had someone go off on her for the seven years she had worked there. But the book is no longer in the @LOCATION1 library, I can not remember the title of this book, I just know that with a mom like mine she can get something done.   Just like Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I can tell you from experience and observation, you can do and get what ever you want with a little power and persausion.

4121,"Books being taken off the shelves?  No way!  The @CAPS1 is the place to go if you want books, movies, music, etc., that fit what you like and want.  Should some material be taken off the shelves all because of it offending someone else?  No, because Libraries are ment for everyone for a reason.     Everybody is diffrent.  Which means everyone comes to the @CAPS1 for diffrent types of information.  If the libraries took off all material that offended people there would be nothing left.  What offends someone @MONTH1 not offend someone else.  For example, the libraries have information on the @ORGANIZATION1 history.  While some people like that kind of information and want to continue learing about it, the information is also offending @CAPS2 @CAPS3 who it talks about.  But really if you think about it, its all selfish to take away material someone else wants to learn about.  It would be keeping the next generations to come from learning everything they possibly could or wanted to.     When people go to the @CAPS1 they know, no matter what information their looking for, they will find it.   Isn't that whats so great about trips to the @CAPS1?  Looking and finding things you never learned about, even if it offends others. All that matters is that your head is holding more knowlege about that certain subject. It will never be okay to take certain material off the shelves that offends other people because libraries are ment for everyone for a reason",3,3
3316,"Censorship is a topic that it strongly opinionated. If one person does not like the content of a text, that person could might find themselves saying that they have to right to obstain from being able to view that text in a library, public location, or online source. But what about the other people? Shouldn't they have a say too?     Let's say that 'person one' does not agree with the language in a text, but 'person two', perhaps does. Which person has the benefit in @CAPS1 situation? Freedom of speech and expression are two factors that are very valued, and pherhaps sometimes even overlooked in our society. In @CAPS1 case, both 'person one' and 'person two' are allowed have a right to say and think what they feel about the text.      Should 'person one' still have the right to say that @CAPS1 text does not belong in a public location? Well, if every person had the right to remove something that they disagreed with from the public, there nothing would be left. In such a large and diverse society, there is bound to be at least one person who does not agree with the content of a certain material of each and every lyric, magazing, book, and text that there is avalible.      Some might say that @CAPS1 is unfair to that one group who does not agree with the content of a material. But how is that fair to the other group who actually do agree with that material? Freedom of speech and expression are still not being excluded from that group who does not agree with such material. That group is still allowed to speak their opinions and takes on that particular material, as well as the people who do agree with the material.      Take iTunes for example. If there is a song that has language and/or content that could be considered disrespectful to a person, there is a red tag by the song that says: 'explecit.' @CAPS1 is an indecator that a person who could find foul language offensive, that such person should no buy that song. There is also the compromise. Quite often, if a song is tagged as 'explecit', the is usually an alternative of the same song. That same song is then tagged with a gray tag that states: 'clean.' A song being 'clean' simply means that the song is still the same, but the considered to be disrespectful content is removed, or removed and replaced with different words that are not considered to be disrespectful. Both parties are now satisfied with the so called: happy-median.      Take movies as another example. Movies are rated based on their content. The higher the rating, the more explecit such movie is. Along with the rating, there is an explanation as to why that movie is rated the way that it is. If you are a person who is careful about viewing things that are against your own opinions and beliefs, then by seeing the rating and explanation, such person knows that @CAPS1 material is not for them. Again, the happy-median.     For every given case of a goup of people who do not agree with the terms of a certain content, the alternate group must be considered as well. Both parties in @CAPS1 case are still able to say and express their own opinions. So, should @CAPS1 context be removed from the eye of the public because a certain group of people do not agree with the content in it? No. However, one must keep in mind the views and opinions that each person has on such material, and that person should still be respected for their take on that material",3,3
3711,"I agree and disagree with the prompt. I think that it is good everyone is allowed to take any book off the shelf, listen to any music, watch all types of movies, or read any type of magazine. Then I think it isn't okay.     First, reason for agreeing is because some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. @MONTH1 not be suitable for most young children. They @MONTH1 use profanity, show naked pictures, or take about things that a child is not yet supposed to be exposed to at that age. Most music and movies these days use bad language or show people having sex or without proper clothing. Also, adults @MONTH1 use these materials in a way that could cause many problems with the library. So these are my reasons for agreeing that certain materialsm such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves if found offensive.     Then, on the other hand I think that libraries should leave most of the books, movies, music, or magazines on the shelves for everyone to take off. I say this because if a child does not be experienced to what could happened if they use bad language or go out without proper clothing, or go on watching adult movies. So this gives them an opportunity to see what is wrong with it if they are exposed to these things at a certain age. I think it would be better if they had a section for the books other than just taking them off the shelves permenantly.      In conclusion, I think that this could go both ways. But, the books, movies, music, or magazines that are felt like they are offensive should be move to a certain area in the library",3,3
4372,Some books are offensive but not all of them. Some libraries have begun to censor their book collection by removing ones they thought could be offensive. I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries.     One reason I do not believe that there should be censorship in libraries is that tons of good books are lost because of it. Some libraries do not carry @PERSON1 books because he uses curse words. They should not remove the books completely they should just warn people of the language.     A second reason why I do not believe in censorship is that some books on different religions get removed. I once saw a librarian throw a book away simply because it was about the @CAPS1 religion. This was a horrible action because the @CAPS1 religion is an extremely interesting one and now many people will never know anything about it.     A third reason is that they @MONTH1 end up offending some people by removing a book. I once heard of an @CAPS3 family complaining about a library because they removed a book about the @CAPS3 religion. I found this upsetting because everyone deserves to have access to the books that they want.     I propose that instead of censorship the libraries seperate the books by different subjects and genres then put up signs warning anyone that goes into that section. This way everyone can get the books that they want to get. The libraries also would not have to worry about people being offended.     I believe there should not be any censorship in libraries. Some libraries have begun to censor their book selection by removing ones they thought could be offensive.Some books are offensive but not all of them.,4,3
3265,"A very wise man in @CAPS1 life once said, 'The only way to escape temptation, is to remove the temptation all together.' @CAPS1 @CAPS2, @PERSON2, while growing up had poor influences all around him. @CAPS4 went to a run-down school, lived in a crime torn neighborhood, had a drunk for a @CAPS2, had no mother around to help him and had an older brother that often beat him and hurt him, emotionally and physically. As @CAPS4 grew up there were temptations to do the wrong thing morally all around him. @CAPS4 had no example of how to behave, yet @CAPS4 stayed away from @CAPS3, tobacco, drugs, guns, prostitutes, violence and fighting, and even something as 'minor' as pornography.      As I have been growing up with @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a hard working individual and having @CAPS1 mother around to help me with school work and preparing for college, the truth shows how times have changed. Just before I was born, @CAPS1 parents moved out of the old crime riden neighborhood and out of the city for that matter. We moved to the suburbs where crime is more rare and mostly just misdimeaners. @CAPS1 @CAPS2 told me one day, 'I'm scared by how the times have changed. When I was a kid, fowl language was un heard of in songs and music but now-a-days the songs seem to be about nothing but sex, drugs, killing people, and even about rape! At this rate I'm scared of the thought of what you're kids are going to see, son.' @CAPS4 had a valid point. In our curent days the youth can go to even the public library and get books on illegal drugs and movies with sex scenes and music that talkes about killing law enforcement officers.      What has the world come to when a child of age eight @MONTH1 walk into a public library and check-out a book on cocaine? The worst part is that they can just read these books while browsing, they don't actually have to check the book out. A quote from the author Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' I believe that rather than hoping they don't pull the book off the shelf that we should just remove the book from the shelf and @CAPS5 have the book there at all.      Public libraries are marked as safe places for children and adults to go to if they feel thretened or endangered. Well what if @CAPS1 @CAPS2 as a parent feels thretened by the fact that there are evils out in the world and they have become so accepted by todays society that they are even found in the public library? Then what? Public libraries and other public resourcess should be controled and monitored about what they allow into their doors. A parent SHOULD @CAPS5 have to hope that his or her child doesn't pick up a book about an inapropriot topic while in public but should know that that is @CAPS5 the case. Parents should be able to relax and rest asured that their child is safe from the filth of inmoral things",4,5
3696,"Everywhere one goes, something is being kept from them. It is either to keep them safe, pure, or happy. In the everyday world people who break the law are put into jails and prisons. Not only is it a punishment for them, but it is also to keep them away from other people. This is much like how our libraries are becoming. Books that have questionable content are being thrown out.     I do not believe that this should be done. Books are here to enlighten people and let them experience something they never would have been able to on their own. People should be able to choose what they @CAPS5 and if it offends them they can choose by theirselves to stop reading that book. Many times I have learned new things from books that @MONTH1 not have been appropriate for my age, but it taught me a valuable lesson. For example, I @CAPS5 a book about a teenage girl engaging in sexual relations, she became pregnant and it ruined her life. From this, at the age of ten years old, I learned that I do not want that to happen to me, so I am abstaining from adult relations until I am married. Of course the libraries should be seperated into different categories such as: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, and @CAPS5 at Your Own @CAPS6. Also, the same with magazines and music. That way, a person could go to a specific section and know what to expect from there. This is much like the movie ratings, a mother can pick up a movie and see that it is rated @CAPS7 and know that it is exceptable for her nine-year old to watch, except possibly save for a few curse words, but a child hears that in their everyday life anyways, wether the parent knows it or not.      In conclusion, I believe that literature should not be censored from the people. However, it should be categorized so a person could have an idea of what age group it would be most appropriate for. People have the right to choose what books they @CAPS5 and what they @CAPS5 about. Everyone can learn a valuable lesson from any book, it just depends on how they interprate it.",4,4
4585,"Yes, some materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are offensive.Yet they shouldn't be removed from shelves.Reason number one is: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. Reason number two is:'offensive' material will @CAPS6 be out in the world.And finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. In @CAPS2 following essay, I will explain thoroughly my reasons for an opinion as such.     '@CAPS1 is one man's trash is another man's treasure.' @CAPS2 quote goes very well with the first reason: @CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. People's views about everything could be significantly different. For example, a book about @PERSON1 killing the @CAPS3 could be offensive to someone with @CAPS4 descent, meanwhile,a book filled with cursing could be offensive to a religous person. As you can see,'offensive' is defined differently by different people.     Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. Parents can't shelter their child from these things forever. At one point in their lives, children will learn offensive things and parents won't be able to do anything about that. Children have actives mind that pick up on everything around them. If they learn from these offensive materials, then parents should teach them @CAPS1 is wrong and @CAPS1 is right.     Finally, if parents don't want their children reading offensive material, they should only ban their children from reading them and not the rest of the world. @CAPS2 reason ties in perfectly with the first. Parents can't decide @CAPS1 the parents of other children should do. They can only do something about @CAPS1 their children are doing.     Therefore, my belief on censorship in libraries is nonexistant for the following reasons. @NUM1.)@CAPS1 some people find offensive, others don't. @NUM2.)Offensive material will @CAPS6 be out in the world. And @NUM3.)If parents don't want their children reading offensive material,they should only ban their own children from reading them and not the rest of the world. Thus, there should be no censorship in libraries",3,4
3306,"If we were to take away every thing that someone in the world finds offensive, there would be nothing left. Many people in different cultures find many different things offensive. it's not right to take away from others something becuase a select group of people take offense at it. Something being offensive isn't always a bad thing. There's many different reason why, but removing something because of someone else's opinion isn't right.     First, whether you find something offensive or not, is laregly based on your culture. To most @CAPS1 cultures, declining food is offensive. To @CAPS2, eating or hurting cows in anyway is a complete disgrace. If something is offensive to one person, it @MONTH1 be because they have a different background. You're never going to please everyone.      Second, one of the best thing's about the @LOCATION1 is that you can have your own beliefs. If something was removed from the shelf at a library, because someone found it offensive, I would be disturbed. I have my own beliefs that I'm sure not everyone agrees with. Some of my beliefs wuold be offensive to certain people. That doesn't mean I should have to stay silent about my beliefs, does it? No, of course not. I wouldn't want anyone else's beliefs forced on me. I'm sure no one wants my beliefs forced on them. By removing things from a shlef becuase took offense at it, you'd be removing freedom of speech from the shelf also. That's not only wrong, it's illegal.     Some people would be offended at a book with a cross on it. Some people would be offended by a @CAPS3 cover with a pentgram. That doesn't mean they should be taken away. It's good to get offended sometimes. It often makes people stand up for what they believe. To me, it's reminder of why I believe what I do. I @MONTH1 be angered by what I see. I'm sure the terrorist group @ORGANIZATION1 is greatly offended when they see the @CAPS4 flag. We wouldn't stop waving it, would we? That'd be absurd! Just because someone takes offense at something doesn't make it wrong. It never has. It just means they have different beliefs. We should have the maturity to look away instead of demanding that it be removed.      I personally believe that removing things from the public eye, merely because they're offensive, would be wrong for many reasons. So many people find so many thigs offensive. It'd take away everythign if we removed eac and every one. Removing offensive items would also be an intrusion of freedom of speech. Plus, many things that are offensive often remind of of who we are. We should be string enough to look away and not fight about it. I don't think they should be removed. I want my library to be what @CAPS5 was made to be, a mixture of cultures and backgrounds. I don't think anything should be removed unless it directly causes harm to people",5,5
4256,I believe books are writen for a reason and the words in the book goes with  the whole point of the book is the words in the book are ment to be in the book. But I am also the kind of person who sees words that are to offensive for people to read. But no by far I  think not letting people read the books that has offensive wording in it is kinda off silly because the author ment for it to be in there and if you change one word you kind of are changing the whole book and whats its trying to say.      But if some books are to offensive yes i believe it is good to not let people read but to take it off the market and exit the book and and try to resale it. But some people would be upset about the changes we make because they will think that the book is saying  something different but its not it is just worded differently. But i believe in both not to stop letting people reading them and for them to stay on market. Why I think its good to let books like this go on books that had offensive wording in it yes its worng but its also worng for the people who dont see it as being a offensive.     Am sure the author of any book that has offensive wording in it didnt mean for it to hurt you. Am i know in my heart that they are sorry for hurting you in anyway. But why I think they should stop is because some people would really have a hard time reading offensive wroding  it could be about  something that happend to them when they are little or just a word maybe they just dislike. But if they come across any word they dont like they  should stop reading.      I believe it is very unfare if they take a book away just because there might be one word someone dont like. But to others its does nothing to them. I think books that have a offensive wording should say somewhere like on the back of the book it should have a warning if it has any offensive working in it I think this would help out alot of people would start doing that.      This is really kind of silly because a book is a book and you should alway read about the story on the back of the book and if its a offensive and you dont like it that tells you not to buy the book. Dont always buy a book by the cover because the cover could be with flowers on the front of it and the book might not be about flowers at all.     I really feel like am on both sides,3,3
4292,"There should be a certain age bookshelf that only certain aged people are aloud to look at. It's like the adult section at the library. Theres no reason why they should be removed off of the shelves. I would understand if the little kids could come see the books and movies and be offended by it or scared but thats why you would make a certain section just for older more mature people.     It would just depend on what offends people and what would make them offended. Some things could or would be bad to have little kids see them, but just make sure they couldnt get in the reach of young kids or not matured people. The only way i would say remove them if it was really offensive such as racism and things like that.     Censorship in libraries in my opinion is a good thing. Just because the fact of some people might not like the things that would be in a library or things that they have in the library. So I would have to say yes on cersorship in the library.",3,3
4349,"Some materials in libraries @MONTH1 have information that is offensive towards others.  But should they be removed if they are found offensive? Some people believe that they should be removed depending on how bad the offense is. But materials @MONTH1 be removed if it is sexual, racist, or life threatening offense.     Some material @MONTH1 have offensive comments that is sexual. If its an offense that is sensored and the author or artist of the material went too far, then that @MONTH1 be a good reason for the material to be removed.  It @MONTH1 make the person feel emotions that bring them down.  It @MONTH1 also make the person feel violated and offended.     There @MONTH1 be material that has racist comments.  Racism is one of the biggest conflicts in the world today.  It is something that starts fights and arguements.  It also causes individuals to feel bad about themselves.  Racism can cause people to feel very hurt also. So if there is too much racism in a material, then that should be removed.     There are some material that @MONTH1 have offense that seems life threatening.  Say that it is a book about the whole nation and the author slips in something that @MONTH1 seem like the nation would be in danger, someone @MONTH1 feel offended and want that material removed.  Material with too much threat in it @MONTH1 make one feel like their life is in danger or like something bad is going to happen.  They would feel a life threatening offense and want it to be removed from the shelves.     So should offensive materials be removed from the shelves? Yes they should.  If they were to be found sexually, life threatening offense or had racist comments, they should be removed so individuals won't feel these offenses are life threatening, hurtful, or cause negative emotions",3,3
2980,"Do you think that libraries should remove certain materials off the shelves? People have different oppions, of whats good and whats bad. I have read and seen a lot of books in my life time. I hear people telling me, 'oh dont read that book its a bad book.'But I ask myself, @CAPS2 do I know it's a bad book when I haven't even given it a chance?'      @CAPS1 are some books, music, movies, and magazines out @CAPS1 that are offensive. Yet we still want to read, listen, watch, and look at them. If we tried to remove all the offensive books, from the libraries we wouldn't have anything left on the shelves. Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work i abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson makes a great point out of her quote. Why should we have to remove a book if just some people think its offensive?     Ask yourself the question again, '@CAPS2 do you know it's a bad book when you haven't even given it a chance?' @CAPS3't judge a book by what you hear. Find out what your own oppion is",2,3
4012,"My views on censorship in libraries are alike in many different ways.     Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries if they are found offensive to more than just one person.  If they are not that big of a problem they shouldn't be removed.       People might change their mind about going to that particular library, if they find a lot of offensive things there.  Also having these offensive things in libraries greatens the chance they could be read by the wrong minds, and it could possibly change how most children act, or think.  A few things that I would find, that would bother me are books or magazines that contain drugs, nudity, horrible violence, and bullying.     From my own experience, having books that contain these types of problems are very offensive to most parents and can effect the way you live, if you take them seriously.  Some libraries don't even realize that they have these offensive books, magazines, or videos.  I have had a teacher take a book away from me and I got in trouble for reading it, even though it was in the library where anyone could have grabbed it off the shelf and read it.  In my opinion I think libraries should take the time and look through the books they have and decide whether or not they  are considered offensive to parents if their children were to read them.     I agree with removing certain materials that contain offensive things, from all libraries.  Also I believe if parents could choose they would decide to get rid of all the mean, nasty, and offensive materials",4,3
4674,"Today, we all have a very large variety of books to choose from when we enter a library. Some are childrens books, while others are intended for a more mature reader. Many parents are scared that their child will read a book that @MONTH1 be inappropiate for their child. The thing is, if everyone removes the books that they don't find acceptable, there won't be any books left in the library for us to enjoy.     What makes a book unacceptable to read? Could it be language, graphic scenes, or parts that are just extremely scary? Many people think that books like these should not be available for anyone to read. Removing a book from a library would be done through one's opinion. This is not fair because we all have the right to free press, which means that anyone can publish anything they wish to and everyone has the right to read it. By removing books from a library, you are violating not only the author's right, but the reader's as well.      Unfourtunately, there are some books that @MONTH1 cause a child to become scared. When a child reads a book, it's harder for them to realize that they are just reading a book. Many children take in every word of a story and turn it into a reality. Not only can this scare a child, but it makes it extremely difficult to explain that what they read in the story is not true. As more and more of these books are released, the more likely it becomes that children will be reading these offensive stories.     I believe that removing books from a library based on opinion is wrong. I understand that leaving these types of books out for children to read could cause a problem, but libraries are usually set up in sections. For instance, there is a childrens section, a teen section, and an adult section. This helps kids remain in an area appropiate for their age. I think that if a parent is worried enough that their child will read an offensive book, then they should go with their child to the library when checking out books to read.     A public library is designed to accompany a vast variety of readers. There will always be certain books that some of us find offensive. Removing books from a library only decreases the number of books to choose from; and if that were to happen, there would eventually be no books left for anyone to enjoy.",4,4
3446,"The quote that Katherine Paterson declairs a very strong point and is completely true in my eyes. Everyone thinks and functions differently so therefore something offensive to one person might be completely fair and good in anothers point of view.     Everybody thinks different and as you go to school or work everyday you find that obvious by just about anything the person is doing or owns. For instance, their clothing. Belongings can show a lot about a person just as much as actions or words. So what do you think? Do you think that any material from the library should be taken off the shelf just because someone or a couple of people think its offensive or terrible? In my opinion, no. Every book, magazine or anything in the media can send out a different message in everyones personal thoughts. For example, one movie could touch someone in a very special way and at the same time, someone right next to them could think it's disguisting and cruel. I have actually had a real life situation were this has been a conflict.     During the years of my seventh grade experience there was this playstation game that i loved to play and enjoyed playing every single day with all of my friends. My mother, and pretty much the entire @LOCATION1 found it very offensive. It was really awkward and annoying that one of the things i loved is something that they tried to ban and not allow it to be sold from local stores. Now being in my shoes how do you think that felt for me? I thought it didn't feel very fair at all, it's selfish and inconsiderate. That's like taking somebody possessions and telling them your opinion on them and then ditching them into the trash to rote and vanish forever.      I believe that you should be able to read anything you would like in the library without the fear of your next favorite book being taking off of the shelf because a group of people protest from the language or whatever they think is offensive to them in the novel, because the next time you know it, everything will be gone from the shelves since everyone has different opinions. If you dont like the novel, then i assist you to return it, and to never read it again. I feel this conclusion is very fair and considerable. So what do you think as readers, is it fair to be able to read whatever you want or do you think if you or someone finds it offensive, you can take it off of the shelves?",4,3
4070,"Many books, movies, and magazines are made for the different age groups of adults and children.  I do agree that certain books are not approperiate for some children.  Is it right for some parents to ban books from schools and libraries?  Authors create books and stories because they like the idea, and students can wright what we want on paper because it's what we want it's called freedom.  Schools can try to be creative and have a way to only allow books to the approperate age groups.     Books are a great part of a students learning.  Parents need to learn, and understand no matter how much they don'@CAPS1 like it that they can'@CAPS1 protect their children from the world some day they will be moved out of the house supporting themselves.  How would childern and teens even know how to live or what and how to react to hearing a bad word or watching sexual on @CAPS1.V.  If students never know how will they live.       Books can be learning in many ways.  Some things a teenager might be experiencing a parent might not want to talk about with their child.  Maybe the family can'@CAPS1 afford to buy a pass to the public library. So the only other option is the school library books.  If students can'@CAPS1 have access to then whats the option for them?  Everyone knows how today's society is changing, if a student wants to learn about sex or @ORGANIZATION1's they should be able to if the age is approprite.     All libraries check out books so the book is under a name.  I know at our school students just come in and take the books instead of checking them out, but some students do still use the card and check the book out.  If schools had books that our for only a certain age group a soultion to getting the older students to check them out and only the right age could be the books are in a case that is locked up.  So for the student to have the book unlocked and checked they have an electronic key to unlock books for the age group they are in. When the student unlocks the book and goes to check it out the computer knows what books that specific student can get.  Books are very important to learning and all books need to stay and not get blocked by  parents.",4,4
3906,"No Censorship     Do you enjoy reading interesting books, watching superb movies, or listening to appealing music that some people don't approve of? Most people would answer yes to the question because anything that a person reads, watches, or listens to @MONTH1 be found offensive or crude to someone else. Certain materials in libraries should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive because different people find different materials offensive, people sometimes specifically come to libraries to search out materials they can't find elsewhere, and if a person finds a material offensive, they don't have to keep reading, watching, or listening to it.     The first reason reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because different people find different materials offensive. Each person is different, and people have all sorts of opinions on books, movies, magazines, music, etc. Also, several different ethnicities exist in the world and many nonfiction books educate people on different cultures around the world. The ethnicity of the people living in the culture @MONTH1 find what the authors of nonfiction books are writing about them offensive because the book is talking about something in their culture they wouldn't want the public hearing about. However, the public needs to be educated on the cultures of different people. Students do research in libraries for research projects and essays. Also, books pertaining to racism such as To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 and books about slaves @MONTH1 be offensive to the race that is being victimized in the book. In contrast, some people @MONTH1 love the book because of the a good theme, symbolism, word usage, etc. So, who would be the judge of whether a material is offensive of not? If the person who is doing this for a certain library finds many materials in the library offensive, the whole library could close down because many materials that could have been popular were taken out of the library.     Another reason why certain materials shouldn't be removed off shelves if they are found offensive is because sometimes people specifically come to libraries to search out materials they cannot find elsewhere. Libraries are the one place that people go if they are looking for that certain book or maybe even a movie they can't find at a video store. In my experience, there have been an infinite number of times where I have wanted to read a book I have heard about, and I've gone straight to the library and found it there. Also, because no video store exists in the town I live in, I go to the library for movies because I know they have a large selection. Some of the books and movies I or other people like @MONTH1 be found offensive to others, so if they were taken off of library shelves,I'm not sure if I would go to the library as often.     A third reason why censorship shouldn't occur in libraries is because people don't have to read what they @MONTH1 find offensive. Everyone has the choice of what materials they acquire from a library, unless it's something they have to read for school. If a person hears about a book that @MONTH1 be found offensive to them, why would they read the book. Also, if a person accidentally checks out a book or watches a movie from the library that they find offensive, they can always just stop reading the book or watching the movie.      Censorship shouldn't occur in libraries because everyone has different opinions. Libraries assume that if someone finds a material offensive, they'll just stop reading it. Also, if libraries take out all the materials anyone finds offensive, what will be left to read, watch, or listen to?",4,4
3847,"As I walked through @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 as a young girl I saw a @CAPS2 magazine book, seeing this and being a girl that likes reading that magazine I opened it. I soon found out it was a book that I would never actually read. I found my self embarrassed  and wondering why they wouldn't make it clearer that it should be censored. I think that censorship in libraries and book stores is a good thing. Yes, kids need to learn about relationships and intimacy, but that is their parents jobs. A @NUM1 year old girl should not be able to see an inappriate movie, magazine or book when ever she wants because we need to teach them ourselves. Censoring magazines gives children a chance to find who they are not what the world wants them to be.  Censoring the book helps by keeping small children 'sheltered' they don't have to know everything by age ten. It gives them time to grow up themselves. The movies that are made give a false out look on what sex and intimacy really is.      You flip through magazines and see child stars everywhere feeling the pressure to grow up. They think they have to dress like an adult and act like one too. Children see this and think that if @PERSON1 acts like that so should I. The magazine industry really hurts children in the long run. They put the super skinny model in a barely there bikini. Sports @CAPS3 prides its self on that. Maxim has the '@CAPS4 @NUM2 a bunch of @CAPS8 laying around in clothes that barely cover them. The boys all think that its @CAPS4 and that that's what every girl is supposed to look like. They get the @CAPS5  magazines and drool over how the center fold looks. Letting small children see this makes them think that they have to dress and act a certain way. It makes them think of you dress like this when you get older you can get all the boys too.      Today there are so many books on how to keep your man happy, how to spice up the bedroom, @NUM3 things to try in bed tonight that a child could just walk and see. Many of these books have images of how do this and that. That it could really make a child and his or her parent(s) feel very uncomfortable. When yougo to @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 or any book store they have a relationship, love section that are all these kinds of books. Many young people @MONTH1 think love, oh I bet that's @CAPS7 or a @PERSON1 and @PERSON2 book. They see the cover that intrigue them. They think oh this girl is pretty.Censoring these books can give an ease to kids and parents. The kids can just grow up the way that they should.      Now movies give a very large false pretence on what sexual intercorse really is. They see the people do all these things and they think that its normal and you don't have to worry about a thing, but kids here's the kicker sex is not just sex. When you have sex you have to make sure you are safe. This isn't just fun and games. In @LOCATION1 today many young @CAPS8 get raped. Does it show that on the movie no it doesn't, many young @CAPS8 as little as five go around thinking about how awful it was to raped, but yet we set back and let pornography be made. Pornography is false, @CAPS8 don't just look at eachother andget turned on. Sex is never going to just be sex, and by censoring the movies kids don't get that idea before they really learn and have the knowledge of what sex really means and is.      Censoring is something that I strongly believe in. To this day my parents still make sure the movies we pick are appropriate. Parents and children can learn about sex whenever they want, but some parents choose to wait. By putting those movies and those books in a separate area it gives parents the chance to teach their kids, and the kids time to grow",4,5
3731,"There are many things in this world that childeren should not see and that poisen the minds of them and others whatever age they @MONTH1 be. The things people see these days can be bad and shouln't be seen by anybody of any age. These things should be disposed of so our minds will be clean and the minds of future generations will be clean also.     The reason that I think that no one of any age should think about these bad things is because if kids shouldn't know about them than, then why should the same kid that has grown up know these same thing. But if things like this are in libraries thenthe question is who should be in charge of deciding what is right for wroung?      Sence the worlds population is so large and so many people have diferent ideas then how could we get one person to look through all things and decide between good or bad? Well the awnser would be that it is impossible to. That is why it is up to the head of the family to decide what to do about this crisis.",3,3
3958,"Do I believe that our libraries have some books on their shelves that they shouldnt have. Well of course I think that there are some books, music, movies, magazies, that young children should not read about, hear, or watch. These kind of things affect our every day living.      Lets start off with a book that has killing in it. I'm not a parent at the time, but I know for a fact that I would not wan't my children reading about that kind of violence. Thats not something that a twelve year old child should be reading about. Those kind of books could get kids thinking oh he killed someone why couldn't I, and thats how some kids grow up to be bad and have to go to jail at the age of @NUM1, because they have killed someone or tried at least. There also other books that some children shouldn't read about and that @MONTH1 be about slavery. If a mother doesn't want their child to know about slavery at the age their at there shouldn't be that type of book on the shelves for a ten year old to read about. I mean if I had family members that lived in the slavery days i for sure wouldn't wan't my kids to read about it, because that shows how white people disrespected the blacks and that could have an affect on that child. That could cause them not to like white people.     Second is the music. I know that most libraries don't have all that bad music that is on the radios, but I'm sure there is some music that has something about steeling on it. Thats aother thing that could give kids the wrong idea and send them on the wrong track again. There's just some things children shouldn't hear unless their with one of their parents, and then that parent could explain to them that you shouldn't do what the song says. But they shouldn't be in our school or public libraries.     The third thing is movies. There should not be any movies of killing, breaking in peoples houses or fighting at any sircumstance in a school library. School is not a place for a child to be watching those kind of things. That just gives a young child the wrong kind of idea, and isn't approperiate for schools to have.     The last one is magazines. There should notbe magazines at school of women in their bathing suits or men with out shirts on. That could make the kid think he could do that and he could get him self in to big trouble.     Thats what I think about the books, music, magazines, and movies in a library.",3,3
3825,"It has been brought to my attention by some members of my community that the local library is planning to remove some materials such as our books, movies, and music. I've confronted them and they've made no such such effort as to amend the censorship that has already taken place. I understand that some works @MONTH1 be found offensive to some audiences, but I believe all people should have access to the knowedge they wish to acquire.     These works they wish to condemn and banish are works of passion and labor. What I've noticed is, the materials they view as compremising are some of the most passionate, heartfelt labors of expression; and I firmly believe this removal act hurts more than those that are banished. This denies those artists of their own freedom of expression and represses something simple, our own expression.     The capibilities of the human mind are limitless, but yet those who display it's functions are limited. Knowledge is the key to unlocking a much more vast understanding of the world around us and I believe this censorship highlights what I attempt to depict in my own exposition of our minds. I believe we have come very far in the evolution of our liturature and I would hate to see the flame of inspiration for creation snuffed out in a modest dash. Just out of a few broken heartstrings? Or a spare tear lost upon the earth, dusted by some ignorance forsaken, missunderstood language doomed to be lost; out of a loss of understanding? I think not.      In conclusion, I've noted what I wish to converse and I firmly stand against this censorship. I'm only one voice, but this is a call to arms and I believe we can accomplish great things together. So let's get the word out and defeat this repression of expression",4,4
3881,"Now take a moment and go back to highschool. Do you remember roaming under the opera house with the phantom? What about fighting for @PERSON2's freedom with @PERSON1? Perhaps getting people into trouble in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS1? No matter what your favorite classic piece of literature was, you recall the wonderful feeling you felt when reading it. It enveloped you into its world, and you felt every sensation it offered. What is this though? The author is a @CAPS2. The author uses occassional bad words. The author is a woman. This is not an acceptable excuse to miss out on everything literature offers. Censorship in pulic libraries is wrong.     The @CAPS3 was a dark time. Thousands upon thousands of @CAPS4 people were killed for their religious belief, as well as homosexual people, and other minorities. Amidst all of this chaos, the @ORGANIZATION1 decided it would be a good idea to burn all books written by @CAPS4 authors. So they did. Millions of books were eradicated along with their owners all because of a religious difference. Does it even need to be asked? This was wrong. Many say that ignorance is bliss, but is it really when people impose their ideas on others?      Let us now look now at what a book, movie, magazine, or song offends with to be censored. A curse word, a bit of skin, a controversial idea. Sometimes these are needed for emphasis of the compilation. Imagine how much less forceful an angry character would be without a few curses every now and then. Pathetic.     So is it worth it to you? Will you give up a beautiful composition because it is controversial? Will you hide your children from materials that will make them form their own opinions? One thing is certain, I will not. I will stand against censorship until it has felt the mighty blow that it has inflicted on so many beautiful works. One day my plea will be heard. Censorship in public libraries is wrong no matter how you put it",5,5
3981,"Remain on the Shelf?     Certain materials such as books, music, magazines and more can often contian offensive information that many would want censored. The people writing the items are not making them so that they are just plain offensive, the way people take in information is the main factor. People choose whether or not to believe certain things for themselves, and with those come their personal opinions. Books and magazines should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive, this could create more problems with the public and those who disagree on what has been taken out, that dont consider them to be offensive.     What is offensive to one person, @MONTH1 not be offensive to the next. Items being removed because of a complaint made by one person should not even be considered. Whether it be a book, magazine, or music the author had a purpose for it and it was not intended on hurting someone's feelings. For example, a book about slavery could be offensive to a white man, but a black man would consider it to be about his history. People can find many things offensive by just reading titles, or listening to one lyric from as song, but that does not mean they have to read the book or keep listening to the song. Someone else is enjoying the book and the song could be what another person looks forward to everyday.     These magazines and books could also be seen as informing. The material in a certian magazine @MONTH1 not be acceptable by some, but a lot of new information can come from them. If everything found offensive was removed from the shelves there would most likley be nothing left. Removing them could cause choas to someone who is trying to learn more about a disease, when another person who is suffering from it does not want their story told. Certian materials being offensive can only offend so many, and chances are what doesnt offend them offends the next person. Informing articles and books should not be removed from shelves in libraries because they are there just to provide a source of knowledge.     Censoring in libraries would also take away from those who are just interested. A lot of people like to read and rent movies just for fun, but chances are if the book or movie does not sound interesting, it is not going to make any profit. What is considered offensive to a person could be the interest of another. From my experience teenagers are interested in alot of action and romantic films and books. They often times contain alot of physical and sexual content along with a decnt amount of foul language. A older person would not be interested in the foul language and content, they would consider them to be offensive to either the girl or boy in the story and would wonder why it is even being read. Most would even say that the books and movies can be degrading to some, but it is what interests teens and makes them want to read more becasue they can't wait to see what is going to happen next. Removing items such as these would push teens away from reading and viewing alot of movies because nothing then would spark their interest.     Scenes and facts in materials that could be offensive to a person are usually not intended to be. People are not being made to read and watch what offends them. Everybody is different and what offends my neighbor @MONTH1 not offend me. Chances are that there will alwasy be something that is going to offend at least one person. The more we all get used to it , the less many people will actually run into items that offend them. They @MONTH1 still be offended on the insided but it won't matter because they will have realized that not everybody is offended by the same thing",4,4
4165,"It is important to know what is going on or what has gone on in the world. If @CAPS1 is unaware, problems can only be helped to a short extent. There is a point in which words can turn into harrassment, but the boundaries before reaching that point can be fairly defended by the freedom of speech. @CAPS1 must learn in order to teach. @CAPS1 must teach for others to learn. Censorship in libraries is more offensive than the material that is hidden.Censorship should be prohibited because knowledge and time is all we have and everyone must receive and give respect.      If @CAPS1 were to look up information about the government on the internet, that person would not find a lot of useful information. It is a challenge to find why same-sex marriage is illegal in some areas or if the words on the news are true. In this generation, our species relies on cellphones, websites with recent dates, and the news. It seems that the time of research is diminishing. @CAPS1 can only learn so much from a world history textbook. It @MONTH1 not be completely accurate. The passing of the information from historian to historian over the centuries can potentially be described as the game telephone. With such a high risk of being mislead, the world needs as much information and thought as it can get. Knowledge, no matter the content, is valuable. It can help @CAPS1 to learn from mistakes and solve problems. The world cannot afford to censor. Censorship does not change the existence of that censored author's thoughts or the reality of what has occurred. The hidden information could be helpful. As this essay is being read, people are dying. It can easily be counted: @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3. They are gone. At any moment, anyone and everyone could die. Time is mainly all we have. We need knowledge to make the most out of it.     Everyone deserves to be heard. If @CAPS1 were to refrain from listening when being spoken to, it would be disrespectful and offensive to the speaker. A lot of the people in underdeveloped countries go with their starving cries unheard. Such cries make the more fortunate, well-fed, and housed people such as myself uncomfortable. Despite such discomfort, this information should not be hidden from anyone. No matter how uncomfortable or offensive a material @MONTH1 be, perhaps the author is simply thinking for himself/herself. Perhaps the author does not find it offensive, and is simply trying to make sense of the world because that is all @CAPS1 can do with all of the problems that exist. Every single person has the right to be heard. The people that believe something should be censored or hidden could have completely different opinions from others. There is no absolute, divine being that can accurately judge a material. The people that censor could be wrong about the content of the material. Because of the great variety of opinions and concept of respect, everyone must be heard.     Censorship should not be allowed because time and knowledge are the valuable building blocks that determine the future of humanity and not a single thought should go unheard. Censorship is a great hindrance to knowing what is occurring and what has occurred in the world. Truth is knowledge and knowledge is truth. It is up to the world to unleash it and make something out of it.",5,5
4455,"Libraries, they are everywhere and all together they contain millions of books that influence everyone who reads them. Whether a book is being read about @PERSON1 or the @CAPS1 there is always something influential to be read. Some books have more adult themes or references to certain subjects which most adults find inappropriate for readers of certain ages. The question is, is it a good idea for those books that are now being censored to be taken off the shelves? In personal opinion; yes those types of books are influential, yes it is possible that it could negatively effect the youth of @DATE1, but everyone has the right to read what interests them.     Being influential is one of the main priorities of most reading materials. There is a point to be proven or a side story to be shared within most books. Is this a bad thing? Is it 'bad' to explain a point of view or to explain a life experience? No, having experiences is only half the point of living; sharing it is the rest. The @ORGANIZATION1 explains one of the more major downfalls in @LOCATION1 and how it brutally effected the people struggling for life and money. Twilight shows the softer side of love and that anyone can be happy if they set their hearts on someone. These are not only experiences but things to ponder upon, and losing these factors in life would be a horrible mistake.     The youth of @DATE1 is portrayed in mostly a negative light. Whether they are considered monsters or maybe even the devils offspring; our youth need influences. Reading is one of the major sources of inspiration for students to grow and prosper. Most students find reading to be boring. In school you are not offered what you want to read. Lists are made, and guidelines are created so that only certain things are read and taught. Young adults need creativity and books are there to shine a light on their eager minds. Taking away the books students and young adults are interested in is one of the many growing problems contributing to people not wanting to read.     Teachers, principals, business men, and even children deserve the right to reading what they like. If you were a sports major and suddenly the population decided sports journals and sports themselves were too harmful and badly influential to people; what would you do when suddenly everything sports related was taken away? You would lose your career. Romance novelists use sensual or even sexual experiences to convey something everyone has trembling inside their minds. Taking away something that is related to something so natural in every day life would have severe reprocussions; especially for those who greatly enjoy those books. Revoking the rights to the literary works of thousands of authors would also take away an intellectual culture that is conveyed.     Influencing people to think about things that are viewed by everyone is not a bad thing when it can be used to inspire people in their lives. Just because someone is a student or a child doesn't mean that a literary work could rot their mind. Taking away something that can contribute to the every day art of life would slowly create a less creative, inventive, and inspired world. Not everyone believes that certain books are bad, and i, am one of those  thousands of people.",4,4
3626,"The seven books which constitute the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series by @PERSON1 are books which are frequently censored in school libraries accross the country. The main reasoning behind this is that since these books portray witchcraft in a positive light, they must be harming our innocent children. Many books, from @PERSON2's 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series have been banned from school libraries due to their content being deemed inappropriate by a group of people who fail to take the larger meaning of these works into account. Works meant to be accessed by the public should not be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are deemed offensive.      Under the @ORGANIZATION1 to the @CAPS7, every citizen has the freedom of speech, press and religion. By censoring the speech of authors, their rights have been denied. It is an author's right to say what he or she feels needs to be said, and it should not be up to a board of parents or directors to prohibit that right.      By prohibiting books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' to be read; the greater meaning of these works is being disregarded. Many conservative @CAPS12 groups have advocated that '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' be banned from schools because of its portrayl of witchcraft (and therefore satanism) and the nominal fact that @PERSON3 has stated that @PERSON4 (the @CAPS15 in the series) is homosexual. However the ultimate message of the series is that love triumphs over evil. Apparently that is not a message worth teaching the youth of @LOCATION1.      However, even if every school in the country took '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' off the shelves; that would not, and should not, stop children from reading these books. Since 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4' began to be part of many schools' curriculum in the @DATE1, it has been at the top of the most censored book list due to its vulgar language and a chapter involving a prostitute. That has not stopped millions of teenagers from reading this novel, which is considered to be a rite of passage for most young adults. Being one of the most continuously challenged books over the last fifty years only seems to add to its allure and its popularity amongst the very people that these censorship boards are trying to 'protect'.      If a parent, however, does not want his or her child to read such a novel; it should be left to the parent to censor what his or her child reads. But just because one parent does not want their child to read '@CAPS1 @CAPS2', does not mean that every child should be denied the opportunity to read it. Censorship should be a matter of the private, not public sphere.      Books and other works should not be censored in libraries. In doing so; an author's freedom of speech is violated and the greater meaning of the work is disregarded. And while certain groups @MONTH1 advocate to protect the children of @LOCATION1 from these offensive works; the children will still find a way to access them",5,5
4264,i fell that this test is stupid i hate reading and writing. i think that you all should only make sure that we can read on level and write on level bc alot of kids arn't even going to really try on this test till like their @NUM1 or @NUM2 grade year and also alot of teachers dont even teach this material till the end of the year           so i think that some of the stuff that u all test on should be changed like the stuff you test on and how long the test is and should be more focest on reading and writing levels     however i do agree that the test should still be here because it helps felter people who passed the class by cheating and who passed it by hard work     i think there should be an alternative test that is taken on paper to because some kids test better on paper then on a computer     this is the way i feel about the test. i know i was supose to write about offensive material but i couldnt think how i felt about it and this is the stuff that was on my mid so i thought i would enform u think you very much,2,2
3748,"Should certain books and magazines be removed from the shelves if found offensive ? YES! Children shouldnt be exposed to certain things. Some books and magazines are to explict for children at certain ages. Children should read books that meet their age group. If children read books that are inapporiate for their age they might start to act out that way. Parents should try and remove all books that are offense to their children because that can have a real bad affect on them. Children at a certain age group should read books thats on their level and apporiate for them.          Certain books, magazines, music, and movies are to explict for kids these days. I think they should all be blocked and out of children reach. If children started to listen inapporiate music and read offense books it might affect the way they act. Children shouldnt be exposed to things that might brain wash them. If kids start toread horrible book and listen to bad music imagine what affect it might have on them in the world we live in today!     I think parents should try and do all they can to keep certain things out of the reach of their children. Parents should protest and call meetings to make sure libraries are taking inapporiate things off the shelves for kids. Parents should want to keep kids far away form certain things that @MONTH1 appear offense. It will mean that they'll doing their job as a good parent.      Sometimes kids wont always agree with what the parent might say but they hav to realize it could be whats best for them. Parents shouldn't always want to be their child friend because, sometimes kids would run over you. I know from personal exprience because sometimes peoplecan take kindness for weakness! Being a parent you should already be prepared for things like this.     In conclusion explict magazines, books, and music should really be taken off the shelves from kids. It might expose children somethings that isnt always good for them",4,4
4753,"I know that some people find some books offensive mean cruel or racist but most of the time people write @CAPS4 beacuase its what they feel or what people want to read. Books are a privlige and we should be able to use that privledge. People need to learn that its ok that books are sometimes are a little harsh. The @CAPS1 is not the most friendly place ever and books can help convay that with less hurt then  experencing @CAPS4 first hand.   I know that all books should be left on the shelfs becuase just because its offensive to someone doesnt mean that you should take @CAPS4 off. For every book someone will find @CAPS4 offensive because of somthing. If the cause is if its offensive then all books should be gone. If someone took the time to go out and write and book and make sure that everything about @CAPS4 is correct then why should we stop them from letting people read @CAPS4. They have a right to write @CAPS4 and we have a right to read @CAPS4 and no one should take that right away. If someone wrote a book on the hollocost people are very offended by that but they dont try to get ride of @CAPS4. so why should any book be different because its not a big event like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3. Its just seem so upserd that people who go to such lengths to get rid of a book just because they are offended by @CAPS4. I think they just need to suck @CAPS4 up and move on. if they dont like @CAPS4 then dont read @CAPS4. Someone who wants to can so do not take that away from the people that want to read @CAPS4.      I remember a time when someone wanted to read a book in are library and they said,'oh you cant read that because @CAPS4 was found to offencive.' @CAPS4 made me uphald that they would deciede how someone els feels about a book. @CAPS4 makes me so angry that they get to dicied how someone els feels about a book. they must be magic becuase I did not know that they know how someone els feels about a book or anything for that matter. we do have books here that are kept behind the librarians desk that if you really wanted to read that book its behind her desk. and im ok with that beacuse at least they have @CAPS4 for people to read if they really wanted to. This is what i think should happen if they have books that they think is too offensive to people. At least try to give an effert to perserve are right as citizens of the @ORGANIZATION1.     Lets throw an other aspect here about money. the book that you want so badly gone from a library was most likely payed by you, the tax payer. So you and a lot of others payed for this book and now you want to wast that money. That is just insane that you would want to wast that money after @CAPS4 being payed for. This just make me want to say wow do you really want to be that upset about a book. Does @CAPS4 make you feel better that you got all worked up over a book and now its gone. Well good for you mission accomplished. All you did was get worked up and you wasted money. People just need to relize the bigger picture not just themselfs but others. In them taking down a book because you were offended, offends me. This offends me a large amount because now you ruined somthing that was not nessisary to be taken down.     This is how I feel about this subject. I am very upset that people would do this and go to such lengths to ban a book away from a library. If you wrote a book and people did this to you how would you feel. I know that you would feel like dirt that someone would do this to your hard work. People need to just calm down and smell the roses and forget about things that do not matter. Stand back and think for a second and say,'will this really effect me if i get this book taken off the shelf.' @CAPS4 also make me mad that the libary bought the book and now its gone so did the money just go to waist becuase the book is just gone. This is how I feel on the matter of getting ride of books.",4,4
3401,"I do not think books , music, movies, magazines etc... should be removed because they are offensive. There are books movies and music that offend everyone if we took them all away we would have nothing. Theres no reason for all that. Thats why i say we do not take away offensive materials.     First, if we took away all the offensive materials off the shelves they would be empty. As well as the library, the movie store and everything else. If something like a book or movie offends you i feel bad for you anyways, but just put it down and dont wory about it.      Second, i dont think we should remove offenssive materials off the shelves because of what they mean to us. They show us the good and bad the right and wrong, thats what books are for. Books are important to this world as well as movies and magazines and such. But to some more than others. You cant get mad at a book or a movie so just learn from them.     For instance, say we did take away all the offensive materials what is that going to do? Is it going to make the word a beteter place? I dont think so. I think we need stuff like that on earth to show and to teach us the way to be. To educate and informate.     In conclusion, i do not think offensive materials should be remove. We would have nothing and the libraries, movie stores and books would be empty. We would also be pretty missinformed about life. So we should not remove offensive materials off the shelves",3,4
3782,"People all around the world think differently about music, books, and movies. Some think that books and music should have different kinds of ratings. Some people think that a song should be rated '@CAPS1' for mature when others could think that it shouldn't have any rating at all. Level rating stops young kids from buying something they are not mature enough for. Level ratings help the parents know what the kids are getting into.      If everyone could pull off a book or magazine, etc then there would be no books left. This is why we have levels of maturty on the material. Levels are letters, such as '@CAPS1' for mature. '@CAPS1' means that their will probably be some naked and sexual play into the video or song. With this on their it warns the parent so that if they do not want their child listening to it they can take it away. This leaves the parent with some control over what kids can watch and hear.     Stores won't let kids under the age of @NUM1 buy a rated @CAPS4 movie. Rated @CAPS4 stands for sexual act, language, and blood. It can stand for more things such as drugs. I am happy that my nine year old can't buy a rated @CAPS4 movie, but senice the law says a @NUM1 year old kid should be aloud to watch it, then its saying they should be mature enough to see or hear it.     We should be happy that we can have some control over what are children watch and listen too. We could try getting rid of all bad books, movies etc, but over time I'@CAPS1 sure more will be made. I am also sure that over time we will find a old copy of a book on a website. We cannot save our kids their whole life, so over time we have got to let them grow up. Our kids will decide if they are mature enough to watch something we would rather them not watch. We just have to raise them the best we can.",3,4
3789,"They will see it eventually. There is no reason to censor a library, I believe. I think they should be sectioned off, maybe put the 'offensive' books in the back  of the libarary is enough censorship. You have to look at it in the publishers view also. They want to sell and advertise their product and they have a right to do so. Libraries shouldn't take their product off the shelves just because someone stumbled apon something they believe is offensive.          We all know what offensive things we could find in a library or a bookstore like @ORGANIZATION1. Things that show innaproperate pictures, drugs, firearms..ect. I believe they are already censored enough. Most of magazines that many people find 'offensive' are always put in the back of the store or secetioned off so people don't stumble upon it or have their childern flipping threw the pages corrupting their minds. Some material are even put in a plastic sleve so the person must puchase it before reading.          If you decide to write and publish a book, don't you think you should be given the right as everyone else to put it on the shelves and promote it? I do, there is no reason why you shouldn't be able to. The library shouldn't censor your book just because someone else thinks and feels it's offensive. That's not fair in @LOCATION1. I think that the libraries shouldn't censor any materials. offensive or not we have the write to publish and promote it",3,3
3289,"In my opinion i don't really think certain items should be romoved from the library. I think this because many people have different kinds of interests in many things they love doing. In my personal opinion I never remove anything from a library because I know their are alot of people with many interests. At the same time I do understand some of the items should be removed from the library, beacuse they could not appropriate for childrern. If we removed cerain items from the library people would get mad.      I think no item should be removed from the library because many people are interested in many things. There are many ways we can arrange the library by sections so that certain books or topics are in one area, and others are in another area. We can aslo make sure that no under age kid can go to an adult area. If we don't remove nothing from the library we would have alot of people coming. In the other hand if we removed a certain type of books, people would get mad and not come to the library. If that happens smaller amounts of people will come.      In my personal opinion no item should be removed from the library because many people  have many interesting in many topics in the library. If we remove a certain item from the library then we would loose a certain amount of people. Thats why we should not remove anything from the library to provent the decrease of people coming to the library. Like I said many people have many intersts in many things and they deservie to enjoy them in the library.",3,2
3035,"Many pepole think that offensive material should be removed from the libary because children could pick then up and look in them. I do not belive this should be done.     They already have a childrens section if a child looks in a inappropiate book outside of the childrens section then its thier fault. I do not think it should inconvience someone to have to go elsewhere to get that cd,game,book, or movie they were looking for. It is very hard to come across a inapropiate book without looking for it on purpose. It could be a book used for teaching health or nursing class and is not meant to be inapropiate at all.          These are a few things you should consider when choosing a side on this debate. Who knows we might have to vote on it someday",2,2
3246,"I do in deed believe that certain material should not be in public libraries, or places where young people can see it. Things, such as pornagraphic material should not be out in the open where kids can see it. I think we would all believe the same way when we say that kids do not need to be seeing these things.     I personaly have been in a movie rental shop, and seen some of the movies that my parents would not want me to see. Material such as this should be put away somewhere out of sight, and requested if wanted.     I also have a religious view on all of this. I know that it is a sin to look at the things such as porn and so the people in charge of the shop, or library ought to respect me and my religion. @PERSON1 in the @CAPS1 says that if eating meat causes his brother to stumble than he will not do so. We need to have the same aspect on life. If something causes someone else harm we should not do it.     This is an issue that we face every day, and the reason I am using pornagraphic material is because it is everywhere. If I am standing in the @ORGANIZATION1 check out line I see the people magazines and I find it verry offensive!     I will say though, if you are old enough to live by yourself than you can look at whatever you want. I just find it untollerable to post these materials were viewers who do not want to see them have to see them.",3,3
3461,"No books should be taken off the shelf. Most people have different taste in books, magazines or movies.  If people find one of those offensive, then why can't they ignore it? They can go find a different one. Not everyone should have the same taste as one person, thats what makes the person we are today. If everyone had the same taste in everything this would be a pretty boring world.I'm more into horror novels more than anything. My own opinion, I think they have alot of excitement; with the killing and what not. I'm also not a big fan of reading, I read when I absolutely have nothing to do.Its very hard to move onto a different series of novels. Such as: romance, horror, adventures, even poetry!It takes alot to understand poetry. Poetry has alot of big descriptive words. @PERSON1 for instance, he's one of my favorite poets; he's actually pretty famous for what all he has done. Well, he didn't become famous until after his death.Overall, not everyone has the same taste in books, magazines, movies or even poetry. We're all different even when it comes to this.",3,3
3025,"I belive certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should never be removed from libraries because even if offensive people still have the right to acess that information. I make this opinion by the guidlines our country was built on, freedom of speech and equality for everyone. If we started removing books, movies etc. from out of our libraries for being offensive, where would we draw the line between offensive and not? To remove even one book from a library for offending a certain race or culture, would be the beging of a tornado of books being removed by eveyone who has ever not agreed with what is said about them or about their culture and lifestyles. Now, let's stop and think about what it means for somthing to be offensive in the first place. People are offended by things in out world every day and books and movies in our libraries are probably pretty low down on the offensive totem pole next to say the internet or news I would think, wouldn't you?. Plus, the materials we provide to our libraries with are for people too learn and teach, they arn't made to be offensive or rude and in my experience with libraries being a @NUM1+ year user I have never found anything to be offesive or hurtful to anyone.In my conclusion there are just too many books about to many subjects already written to even begin to go through which ones are offensive or not and too whom. In conclusion to that libraries are a place of leaning and teaching and the information inside is ment to be helpful and constructive not offesive or hurtful and to start removing materials now would eventualy lead to the end of libraries.",3,3

3764,"In this article I am going to talk about the way libraries sensor their books. I am going to hit points on what I think about the subject. But also give what point of view I feel about the books that are on these shelves. Also on the way libraries should handle this matter by pre-sensoring the books on the shelves. I will try to give details on why it does not or if it has to be taken off the shelf.     I think that certain materials should not be a problem if the librarians can keep a closer eye on what their reading. But it can be stopped by just looking at the review and seeing if this is a good enough book for your child to read. This can be a problem in some ways if kids are exposed to this material that they are reading. But some children can take some of this stuff the wrong way when they are reading a mature type book. But you just can not for get about those books, you have to watch what they are reading.     Some ways that they handle this problem can get a little extreme. If you take a book off the shelf what is the older person going to read. You just can't do this because what if another persons wants that book and they can not have it. But what you can do is make a special section for those types of books young children will not get those books. This I think can help with the problem.     I feel that they could also pre-sensor these books. This will help explain things in a way they can understand it. Plus it can improve the way people feel about them books. But also they print two copies one for a more mature audiance and one for a younger one. If they do this it would make an improvement so younger kids can take this information lke a mature person does and say this is not real life.     In @CAPS1 conclusion I feel like I am nuatral about the subject. I think it is a bad thing to have them on the shelf in a library. But I feell it can be prevented in the way libraries run it. Just keep a closer eye the younger audiance. Also to try and pre-sensor them to make them more friendly to the younger audiance",3,4
3244,"Some books are not suitable for kids. They could make a section for adults that includes books that are not censored. These books should not be aloud to be checked out by kids under the age of @NUM1 unless their parent or guardian allows them to. Some adults don't care what there kids read but the library should. I've read books at school that were adult books at school.      Back in elementary school, I remember checking out alot of books but I don't think they were adult books. Some kids enjoy reading adult books. It helps their reading skills but the content in the book is not suitable for them.     Making a section for adults would help stop kids from reading adult material. I believe that this should take place at every library around the world.",2,2
4033,"As @CAPS1, we are entitled to both freedom of speech and freedom of the press.  However, these rights are somewhat suppressed in the censorship of media at libraries.     I can understand why libraries feel that they need to ban certain works; there are many children that frequent libraries, and having explicit content could deter parents from allowing them to visit.  Surely, though, the media in question could be placed in a seperate area, off-limits to anyone under a certain age.  Even if someone gets their hands on one of these works, safeguards could be used at the front desk to keep them from borrowing the material.  Their library card would show their age, and the worker would not allow them to check out the work if they were too young.     Furthermore, I trust in people's common sense.  If they believe that a book or movie will be too adult for them, they will avoid checking it out of the library.  Parents, as well, will surely not allow their children to borrow risque material.  Information is open to those that search for it, and the knowledge it brings prevents unwanted results.     There are those that want this content banned because it does not conform to their morals, but this is really just setting restrictions on other's freedoms.  They @MONTH1 think it is too explicit, but another @MONTH1 not.  That other person might want to use the material, but because of restrictions set by the first person, the borrowing of the work becomes prohibited.  It seems that if the first doesn't agree with the material, they could just let it be, and not bring others into the dispute.  People know their limits and generally make sure they don't cross them.     I think this conflict represents the @CAPS2 way of life in itself.  When a disagreement arises, no matter what the topic, one group of people wants to basically control what everyone else can or cannot do.  They organize protests, sign petitions, etc. True, people do protest laws, and with good reason.  However, there really is no need to argue over petty issues that could easily be avoided if people were to just use common sense to reach a consensus.  I think this censorship issue is a prime example of that.     When it comes to these kinds of debates, we need to learn that we can't be too quick to place restrictions; that we should leave others to do what they think is best for themselves.  The best course of action is to leave others alone concerning simple things such as this, and to avoid placing any restrictions on anyone's works, rights, and freedom.  To paraphrase @ORGANIZATION1, I @MONTH1 not agree with what you say, but I will fight to the death your right to say it.",5,5
4726,"Every single person has there own beliefs and disbeliefs when it comes to books, music or anything in life for that matter. What @MONTH1 be a bad and vulgar book in our opinion @MONTH1 not be bad in others opinionated views. Everyone will have there own views about a book, music, movies, or magazines. That's why censorship is good in a public place like a library. Does that mean we're saying that you can't like what you want to like, listen to what you want to lisetn to, or watch what you want to watch in your own home? No, by censoring all that in public places like librarys or say video stores your helping fight a lot of trouble and concerns that could happen in the future.          Then again censoring movies, music, books, and magazines in a library could also be a bad thing. Not everyone is going to like the same things or be interested in all the same movies or books. At the same time though we can't censor every single thing someone doesn't like. By removing something because one parent has a complaint over their child watching, or reading a book they thought was too 'vulgar' then your giving that right to any parent that complains about their child doing that. It's not the librarys responsibility to watch over everyones child, to make sure they watch and read what their parents want them to. Kids will be kids and they'll do what they want to do.          By censoring and taking things off shelfs of librarys your not preventing them from watching a movie they shouldn't be seeing, or reading about book they're not supposed to be reading. Censoring librarys is just like censoring words in movies, by doing that it's not stopping your child from hearing or learing vulgar language. Children now in this day and age hear more vulgar words in school then they do in movies and television.       What does the word offensive really mean to a person? Everyone has their own opinion on whats offensive and whats not. Like i said, everyone has there own opinions and views on life and everything in it. You can't remove everything off the shelfs because one parent doesn't think it's right for their child or other children to be seeing, looking at, or listening to. We all have freedom to look at what we want and listen to the kind of music we feel like listening to. By taking things off the shelfs that maybe other people like oppose to others then your taking that right away as a @CAPS1 citizen. Censoring on some things like, sex scenes in movies, or maybe vulgar language in music is alright in my opinion. Taking books off the shelf because you don't like the way its written or you don't like the person who wrote it, or you don't like the kind of language the author decided to use in it isn't alright to me, you're pushing the limit on that one. Books teach kids things everyday, books give children imagination. By taking books off shelfs i think you're hurting a childs ability to grow.      Censoring is a good and bad thing. It could hurt children or it could help their ability to grow. Censoring some things are a good thing, but like i said not everything with vulgar language should be censored, or vulgar scences. Sometimes in order to grow and live in this world children need to read and see the things we as people but in books and movies",4,4
2978,"Certain materials being removed from libraries such as books, music and magazines, shouldn't be removed from the libraries. It gives people a chance to understand how the real world @CAPS2.     Having certain materials such as books and music definitly should not be removed, because most books and music can show most people how bad the statement in the book @CAPS2 or how bad the lyrics are in a song, and help that person to avoid that type of thing that the book or song @CAPS2 saying to the reader or listener. People should give every type of music at least a try and not always doubt what they hear about what people say about that type of music. I always hear about people saying how bad the band @PERSON1 A.M. @CAPS2, just because in the lyrics it talks about drugs and how much cursing each song has. Really the band @CAPS2 talking about one mans life and how he turns his life from being a drug addict to having the best life someone could ever live. People always doubted him and never gave his music a chance. Another example would be @PERSON1's book, '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' for it talks about drug addicts, homeless people, people who have been born with disfigured arms or even someone who lost there legs, and telling how beautiful each and everyone of them really are. His book taught me a few things and made me think different about people. It doesn't matter how they look or how they talk, no matter what, that person @CAPS2 beautiful.     As far as movies and magazines has gone within the last few years, I think that the also shouldn't be taken from libraries. I think @CAPS1 for the same reason of how I feel about the books and music. Of course we see previews of movies and think that they @MONTH1 not be good, but libraries shouldn't keep leave them out. Movies @CAPS2 a great way to learn how to treat others and how to act around other people when you don't know how to act. If you act differently around people that you've never been around before, then you could feel embarassed or maybe even get @CAPS4. Movies can help people learn about the real world by seeing how to do those type of things as we get older. Same goes with the magazines, they also help people see what not to do or to help them understand the consequences of something that shouldn't be done. Knowing what to do from a magazine could possible save your life or perhaps maybe even someone elses life.     I don't understand why some libraries would want to banned certain materials to help people understand the things that happen in someone elses life and to help them not make the same mistakes as that person once did.",4,4
4302,"The offensive things found in a library. In many libraries now a days there are all kinds of vilent and bad books talking about vilenst. Should libraries take these books, movies, or music off the shelfes find out.     The library should not have to take these tipes of things out of the library. If they have bad related books they should just make a different section in the library for them. For rated @CAPS1 movies they can have them in the library. You have to be over @NUM1 years of age. For music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. If the parents dont like it then dont get it.     They should make different sections in the library for the offensive books that they have. Kids under a surtain age should not be allowed to read the books. If they still want the book they have to get parents permissition to rent it.      Rated @CAPS1 movies they should be allowed in the library. You just have to be over @NUM1 to go in that area and with an adult. If you want to rent a movie you need to have parents permissition. You also have to watch this movie with an adult.     Music if it has an @CAPS2 sticker you have to be over @NUM2 to rent it. You can still rent it if your parents say its ok. They should make the @CAPS5 behind the counter. So that little kids can not see the front of the cases. If the parents dont like the libraries rules then dont rent anything from the library.     So dont take off the offensive books, movie, or @CAPS5. If you were head of the library what would you do. Take out the offensive things, or just put them in different sections",3,3
3755,"Imagine. A nice sunny day, sitting outside under a tree and reading one of your favorite books. Feeling the wind in your hair and taking in all that is going on in the story. You not only read at home but at school as well. Just think, what if you could not read that book because it was offensive to someone else in your school? How unfair it would to allow nobody to read that book just because of one person. This i could not imagine.     At my school, teachers and other faculty are always encouarging kids my age to read more often. Most teenagers are always busy participating in after school events such as: band, playing a sport, theater, choir, ect. Not many teens are able to just be alone and read a good book, which is why I was so shocked when i heard about this strange news. Should books, magazines, ect., be removed from shelves if they are offensive? I do not think doing that would be a good decsion. Kids should be able to read what they want to read.     As you probably know, not all kids are alike. Some enjoy things that others @MONTH1 not. For example, not all kids like to eat corn. This goes with reading as well. Not all kids like to read romantic or action books. I enjoy reading romantic and mystery novel. Some novels, more than others have a lot more graphic content such as @CAPS1. @CAPS1 has a lot of fighing in it. If a mother did not want her son to be exposed to fighting, should we take all @CAPS1 movies, books, and magazines out of our libraries? Another example would be the @CAPS3 series. Some parents do not want their children reading about vampires and werewolves. Should we not be able to borrow or rent this movies? I do not think so.     Another reason I do not think that we should take out book and magazines in our libraries is, not everyone is offended by the same thing. For example, @ORGANIZATION2. Personally in my family, me and my brother believed in @LOCATION1 for many years. My cousins however, do not teach their children about @ORGANIZATION2. If I brought over @ORGANIZATION1 and read it to their kids and they got offended, should we get rid of @ORGANIZATION1? The answer is no. Some families have a tradition. Just because one family does not want their kids to know about @ORGANIZATION2 does not mean that eveyone should not be able to get the satisfaction of reading or seeing a movie about @ORGANIZATION2.     So the final question is, should certain materials be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Can one person eliminate more than one book just because it offensive to them? I guess it all depends on your view of the situation. I do not think that offensive novels should be taken of the shelves because: kids should have a choice in what they want to read, not everyone is going to think that the same book if offensive and lastly because if we got rid of all the offensive books; what books would be left to read",4,4
3228,"Censorship in libraries is a very contraversial.  Many people believe that it is the right thing to do while many others strongly disagree with it.  Censorship should not occur in libraries for several reasons.  All people have freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1 and when books are taken off the shelf because they are thought to be offensive you are taking away that right.  Authors have the right to express themselves and the right to have their works equally acknowledged by the public.  Censorship is acceptable in some circumstances but what is censored should not be decided by the government.      First of all, freedom of speech is very important to the people of the @LOCATION1.  If this freedom were to be taken away, it would definitely not go unnoticed.  When books, music, movies, and magazines are censored, the freedom of speech that the author had is being diminished.  For example, what if an athiest wrote a book saying that @CAPS1 wasn't real?  Many @CAPS2 would want to take this book off the shelves of all libraries.  Just because one group of people do not like the topic, message, or theme of a book does not mean that it should be taken out of a library.  A library is a place where all books have a chance to be read not a place where people get to pick and choose what they want there because of their beliefs.     Secondly, authors have the right to express their thoughts and to have their works equally acknowleged by the public.  Of course there will be books that are more popular than others, but at the same time there will also be books that are neglected not because the quality of the writing but because of the topic the author chose to right about.  There is no reason to have a whole community ignore an authors work just because a  large group of people do not agree with what it says.  In that small group of people that were not trying to get rid of that book you will find a number of people that would read the book.  Just because a majority does not like the topic of the work does not mean that the minority should have the book taken away from them.  The author has the right to what they wrote and should have the opportunity to have their work acknowledged.     Last of all, censorship can also be a good thing in some circumstances.  It just depends in what ways censoring is used. For example, many parents do not want their children reading, listening or watching certain things.  The parents of the child should be able to decide what a kid can read, listen, or watch, not a large group of people.  Many parents have different standards and what some parents find acceptable for their children @MONTH1 appall others.  So, there could never be a set standard for what is acceptable and not acceptable without creating a large amount of contraversy.  Once that child becomes and adult they have all the rights to decide what they want to get from a library.  There should be certain limits though.  For example, a person must be the age of seventeen or older to rent a '@CAPS3' rated movie.  This is the same age a person must be to get into a '@CAPS3' rated movie without parental supervision.  Some of the age limits throughout society should be put in libraries, but other than that, the decisions should be left up to the person.     Censorship in libraries will always be changing.  Sometimes it will be in effect while at other times it will not.  People of the @LOCATION1 have the freedom of speech and taking away books from libraries is partially taking away that right.  The author should have the right to have their book equally acknowledged by the public and kept on the shelves.  Censorship should be decided by the person themselves and should not have it decided for them.  Parents should have the say over what their children read and should not have that decision made by others",4,4
4672,"Many people i know would be very upset if there was'nt anymore books on the shelves of the library.  I think there should be books that are offensive, who wants to read a book that is boring and not exciting.The libraries should have lables on the books so when people go to check them out the books there would have a lable that says this book @MONTH1 not be right for sertin people and my contain bad language. Thats just a example. There should be adult and children sections in the library maybe sections for every type of books like murder and mystery.That also goes for the movies, music and, magazines. I love going though the books in the library you never know what to expect out a book",3,3
4604,"What happened to everyone having the right to have freedom of knoledge? I do not believe that certain materials should be removed only for the reason that someone finds it 'offensive' or 'inappropriate'. Our youth have the right to access these materials. Kids should have that right because it allows more access to knoledge, it provides more realistic details about life, and keeps them from being shut out from the world around them. We cannot deprive children of that.     First of all, all children and students at schools all over should have access to more knoledge. If certain materials are censored and taken away, they cannot access that type of learning. What if a student wants to learn more about how goverment and politics work by reading an an article. But then, the article is taken away because of one small comment in it. We cannot take away our aspiration to learn more about the world.     Secondly, it can give a more realistic image of a person, place, thing, or event. Explicit content can give children more details about how things really are in life. If that is taken away, they might have a different understanding of how things really are and have different expectations of things. This might have an emotional or psycalogical impact on them once they see the real world. They should be well informed of what life is like in further detail to avoid confusion once they get to that point.     Finally, they could be shut out from the world if everything is kept from them because of censorship. Being kept from that kind of knoledge can be an emotional strain. A friend of mine had parents that kept her from many things in the world around her, blinding her from what she should have known. As she got older, things became harder and harder for her. And now, she is affraid of many things out in the real world. This is all because her parents had used cencorship to keep her from knowing what was important.      Our students should always have access to knoledge, details about life, and not kept from knowing enough to have an undertanding of things in our modern world. We cannot allow censorship to make such irrational descisions about what we do and do not have access to. And if it has such a negative impact on society and our youth, why isn't it censored",4,4
4045,"Most people consider libraries an unharmful place. However it's often found that some libraries have offensive books as well as magazines on it's shelves. Kids that are interested in reading can't be looking for a book and pick up a @CAPS1 novel with a nude lady on the cover. I do believe libraries need to have some sort of censorship on not only their shelves but computers and movies as well. Let me further explain to you the reasons why libraries should have such boundaries.     A library is a place to get away and explore your mind in a fascinating way; by reading books! Now would you want to be looking for one of your favorite books and find an offensive image? Nudity, cursing, and drugs are all offensive images I have seen in a library. It's not appealing to see an article about some sort of alcohol when its sitting right next to a kid's magazine. What kind of message are we trying to send to them? That it's ok to get drunk or have sex and read the magic school bus? I think there needs to be some kind of organization set up to go around and help censor libraries. Since the media controls the internet and most of the magazines, I think it would be a great idea to dispose of that in our libraries.     Libraries are a reading playground for not only our children but friends and family as well. We don't want our kids getting the wrong message when they go check a book out and pick out an autobiography on @PERSON1. Censorship does need to occur in our libraries and I believe it should happen soon. I'm not saying go and wipe out all the books you have already purchased at sometime because that's already in the past. No matter where you are you cannot escape offensive gestures; but please let's keep it out of the library.",3,3
3488,"With new things coming out these days, I, @PERSON1, believe that all things out in libraries should have a certain organization for certian subjects. I am not asking for any removal or destorying of books, magazines, or anything that is in the libraries but I am asking for a fair hearing of my opinion.     I would like more organization for certian things, I do know people have their own ideas about things that should be in a book. These books found in a library could bring enjoyment to people, but sometimes can offence other people.  So, with this way I would really like if there was a scale, or organization of books.      So with that, people who dont like certain subjects could easily stay away from the books that they do not like. If there is a scale factor of these books, music, magazines, or movies, you can just have a number or a letter symbolizing the certain catagories. Even though, I, personally think it is alittle worse than a different organization, it would atleast worn people of these things.     If you were to deside that either way would be better so then less complaining people would be wanting all books destroyed. I think that organizing the books in a different way would be better. This would be a lot of work but, thinking of a mother of a child could easily keep them away from books the mother would not even touch herself.     I would not like any books removed from libraries. This is because if you start taking one out of the library, that my offence someone, I believe you will start taking out more than one. With this thought I think it will come down to either everyone complaining about a certain book in the library to no library at all. So please, please think about organizing the books, magazes, movies, music, and more so then this will not happen in the future. Thank you for your time to read this, I hope you can find a way of going in to this subject more. Also, maybe publish some too, into the newspaper.",3,3
3644,"Censorship in libraries is kind of a big deal in schools. There @MONTH1 be  a book that someone really wants to read, and they cannot get it in their school's library. A lot of books that are great educational books have been taken off of the shelves of libraries, because they are either too violent, or they have bad language in them. If kids or parents are offended by these types of books, then they do not need to check them out. There should not be censorship on books in schools.          There have been a lot of books, teachers view as being educational books, that have been taken off of the shelves in libraries. Books that teachers would like to give to there class to read. There should not be any problem with giving someone a book that has a few bad word, or a few violent scenes for them to read. Some of the books that are banned could relate to someone, and touch them. Banning books in libraries needs to change.          People should have the right to read what they want to read, even if the book or magazine comes from a school library. There are books that are very good that have been banned. '@CAPS1 for @PERSON1' for example was banned in public schools for some reason. This book is one of my top five favorite books, and i could not check it out of the library because it was banned. This kind of stuff needs to be open to everybody no matter the age.      Censorship in libraries is something that needs to go away for good. Many peoples lives could be changed, touched, moved, etc... due to a book. Many books that have been banned are great books that can have an effect on someones life. People should be able to read what they want to read when and where they want to read it.",4,4
3590,"Do i think that if books, movies, music, magazines, etc should be removed from the shelves just becuase they are offensive? No, i don't think that the stuff should be removed from the shelves just becuase someone thinks or takes it to be offensive. Let's say this ok if we had everybody go and say that this book is offensive, or I don't think this movie should be on this shelve because i think it's offensive or this or that then we wouldn't have anything to wacht, lissin to, or even read. I under stand that yes people do have rights and there believes on something but it doesn't mean that they have any say so on what should stay or what should go.           If we let people do this than nobody would be abel to wacht, read, play,  or even lissin to for fun. Us people used these thing for haveing something to keep us intertaned. Let's say this ok we all know how littel children have thier emanginashon and they used that to keep them intertaned just like us older people used books, music, movies, and ect to keep us intertand. Well if we don't have this stuff than we would be lost and won't know what to do with out that stuff. Just's think of our littel kids if we take there emanginashon away than they would be lost and hoples because that's how they learn and grow up.     We people used this every day use to not onley keep us intertaned but to also help us learn more about what every we need to learn about to survive in every day life. See in ways we are not so diffrent from our chiledren at all realy. they used what every they find or see to keep them intertaned and for enjoiment. If people realy thought about what they are realy going to do by removing something from the shelves than they would regreat that what they did was stupied because now they don't have anything to read, lissin to, or even wacht. I my own self had experience on what it's like to have something like that polled down from the shelves befor and it's realy not cool at all fore that to happen. Takeing something off the shelfs that is alittel bit offensive doesn't meen that it should be tooken off the shelves.     I think that if people who took something off the shelves just becase one person thought that it was offensive if wrong and should not take somthing down that maby other people like. I mean just look at what the thing is talking about first and see if it's offensive to you or not and maybe it's something that people could learn from. Taking something down befor even reading it your self is stupied on be hafe of your part becasue maby other people like and maby you like it who knows. I just think that people should realy think befor they go and take something off the shelves with out haveing alote of people giveing you a bad coment on it befor just taking one persons opean on it.",2,2
3586,"Everyone person can think of something that we did not like or want to see. If you were offended by that one thing, do you think you should have the right to have it taken away or banned? Or what if you liked the choice of what the place had, but someone else didn't? Should they have the right to take it away just because they don't approve?                                            What if @NUM1 people came into a library with  @NUM2 books, magazines, music and movies, and @NUM3 of them did not like any part of the library and wanted every book, magazine, music, and movie taken out? Even if the @NUM4 others loved what they saw? Do you think it's fair just because some people do not approve, that they get to pick? I do not think it would be fair for just one person to be able to have the right to do that. If something is that offensive to that many people, they should be mature enough to ignore what they see and find what they like.

The world would have never ending chaos if people had too much power to change things. It could only get worse.              I have encountered problems between people that do not agree on throwing out or keeping it. One solution could be just move it to a different area where if certain people would like to look at the item they could, otherwise have  separate parts of a room that are divided into all ranges.                                       If you read this and think to yourself about how many different options you have to get along and not have to worry about offending people you will realize that no certain person should be able to take that one thing that you would like to keep to enjoy and be happy.",3,3
4696,"Hi, my name is mason and i'm writing about wether we should take books off the self and etc. People have differnt views on differnt things.     Books, books give a differnt form of lerning to differnt people.I personal don't learn from books as well as I do from the internet or tv but books are nice to have every once in a great while. Eeryone like to sit down and read a good book every once in a while.     Music doesn't really teach you anything, it relaxs you in differnt ways. Some people might learn from listening to music but i'm not one of those peole. It influnce you to get movited, say your getting ready for a football game and you want to get hyped up for it, well some music can get you hyped up for that game.     When i sit down and watch a movie I can learn from it cause i have the patien to sit down and watch it, to learn from it but that is just me other people have differnt ways of learning but the best way for me is to watch movies. They get stright to the point and don't waste time telling you stuff you alredy know.     Magazines are helpful to they have short artcicles that get stright to the point too, and that is what I like about magazines and movies. Even though there are very few magazines that give out helpful information, the ones that do help out alot.     So I think that music should be taken off shelves because they don't really teach you alot but books, movies, and magazine do help you to a certian point. It is up the other people to decide wether music should be taken off the shelves not just one person cause music might help other people in differnt ways not just one way but many ways too",3,3
3595,"Libraries are for children, and adults of all ages. Because all people have different views on life, different beliefs, and different feelings, @CAPS4 makes @CAPS4 hard for libraries to please everyone. There are also different genres that people enjoy reading. Some @MONTH1 enjoy romance and comedy, while others like to read action books or mysteries.     Today, libraries have sections dedicated to different genres of materials. They have kids, fiction, informational, and many more. They also have different areas where you can find movies or magazines. But, if there are magazines, books, or movies, that should be viewed only by certain ages, the library should put a warning sign in the areas where those materials are located.      On the back of movies there is a rateing on @CAPS1 bad the movie is. Why not put a rateing on the back of books and magazines? This way people can know what to expect if they read @CAPS4. @CAPS4 would also help them decide if they even want to read @CAPS4. Rateings on the back of magazines and books would help destinguish what age is appropriate for @CAPS4.      Once, when i was visiting the library, there was a man in the check out line, right before me. @CAPS3 was returning the book that @CAPS3 had just read and checking out the new one @CAPS3 had already picked out. When @CAPS4 was finally his turn in line @CAPS3 stepped up to the counter and explained to the sweet, old, lady at the front desk, what @CAPS3 had wanted to do with his books. She simply understood that @CAPS3 wanted to check out and return one. As she was checking him out she was making small talk and asked, '@CAPS1 did you like your book, @CAPS2?' @CAPS3 replied ' @CAPS4 wasn't what i expected. @CAPS4 was completly inappropriate. ' As they disscussed a little more @CAPS4 turned out that there were tons of curse words throughout the entire book. This is one example of @CAPS1 people don't know what to expect when they read a book.      I don't think that libraries should remove materials off the shelves that people have complained about. They should simply do something to let people know what to expect when they read the books, magazines, or movies. Some people @MONTH1 not mind reading a book with a few curse words here and there, but others @MONTH1 find @CAPS4 outragous. Libraries spend their money to buy these books for the communities. Why take a book off if only a few people find @CAPS4 offensive? No one makes those people read those books, its by their choice. Libraries need to figure out some way to reasure people that they will enjoy what they are reading and not be offended by @CAPS4",4,4
3467,"Censorship    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chldren have taken off the shef. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work I abhor -then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 was quoted from an author named Katherine Paterson. I don't believe certain materials such as books should be removed from shelves under any circumstances. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion about certain materials. If books are removed from the shelves due to censorship, than what is the point of writing or even reading books? If people continue to remove books because they're found to be offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.     I have seen many offensive books. Whether it had something to do with religious beliefs or even revealing too much sexual content, I'm sure it's offensive to someone somewhere. Books are written by authors who believe they have the right to express themselves through writing. If you are to take away or ban a certain book from the shelf, than what would the author who wrote the book think? @CAPS1 world is full of offensive and rather disturbing books. It can't be right to just get rid of those things because they bother us. Everyone has the right to read any book they want to. Just because it offends one person, doesn't mean it offends everyone.     I believe censorship is unnessesary. What gives anyone the right to remove or change something because it's inappropriate? I have personally read a few books that I wouldn't want little kids to read but that doesn't mean I should remove it from the shelves. Perhaps, somebody else has been waiting to find that book. If I did remove it than I'm restricting others from experiencing the joys of reading that book.      Censorship in general is wrong. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and different ways of expressing themselves. I don't believe anyone has the right to take something, that someone has worked on for so long to make, and remove it because they find it offensive. There will always be something out there that you won't approve of. Just because you don't approve of it doesn't mean everybody doesn't approve. Authors write books for a reason, musicians write music for a reason, people make movies and magazines for a reason. What gives anyone the right to take something that somebody made and ban it from the rest of the world because it's offensive?     Books are there to help us become more educated and more open minded towards different thoughts and ideas. We shouldn't just ban them because they offend certain people. If you don't like a book because it offends you, than don't read it. It's just that simple. If people continue to remove books because they're offensive, then there won't be any books left to read.",4,4
4310,I belive that there should be no censorship in the country of the free. In the country of the united states there should be no such thing as censorship. This country has the freedom of speech where we can say anything we want. This one band got banned in the united states of @LOCATION1 for there music. How can your music get banned in the land of the free. I think that there should be no way that any thing can banned in a liberary there should be no such thing. And how can we know good from bad if we never have seen bad. I know that there are some movies and magazines that parents dont want there children seeing. So dont censor it still have it just make it where you got to be a certain age to see that movie from a liberary. There should be no sensorship in the land of free speech. How would we be call the land of the free if we are censoring everything. That is why i dont think we should censor anything in @LOCATION1.,2,2
4204,"I believe that people are able to romove as books, music, movies, magazines, and other thigs that they need to use. There are many people who need that because of their knowledges.     First, we sould be allow to use the things such as books from the shelves. Everyone is allowed to get such as books from the shelves which mean any other person's books or library's. They take that because they need to use and they thought that could be helpful to their work.      Another important reason is that we don't have enough memories to use in the many situations. There are many serious problems and also suddenly accidents in real-life. We don't have enough memories to slove that real situations. That's why we are allowed to take off a book from the shelf.     Most important reason is that the people are want to know many knowledges. I think that is the people's desire to know everything and be smarter than other people or competitions. So, they need many things for their knowledges and take that from the shelves.     In conclusion, things such as books and magazines are allowed to take from the shelves. Then, the knowledges from the books and magazines spread to many people who need",3,3
3295,"Should certain materials such as books, magazines, movies, etc., be taken off the shelf in a library if those items @MONTH1 be offensive towards others? There are many possible answers to this question, but I believe that if someone does not like a certain book or finds it offensive they should not have the right to take it off the shelf.     I believe that him/her should not be able to take it off the shelf because if that person finds it offensive, there are others who would not find it offensive. For example, @PERSON1 might want to read a book about abortion, but @CAPS1 is against and offended by that book or subject. If that book is taken off the shelf, it is restricting other people, such as @PERSON1, who would like to learn or read about that specific subject.      Another reason why I think that certain books, magazines, music, or movies should not be taken off the shelf is because if one book is offensive to some people, then another book @MONTH1 be offensive to others as well. So, if there are people who find some books offensive, and are then taken away; there will be a little amount of books for the other students to read.     Even though certain books @MONTH1 offend people, I think the book or magazine should not be removed from the library or shelf. I believe that if someone does not like a certain book, magazine, movie, music, ect., that person should not have the right for that book or any other material to be taken away. They should not be taken away because other people might want to read that book, and secondly, that would leave a lot less books for other people to read and learn information about.",3,4
3743,"Dear Newspaper,     I don't think there should be censorship at all. Everyone has the right to read or watch whatever makes them happy. Just because someone is offended by them doesn't mean it shouldnt exist. Maybe if you were to take books and movies off the shelfs for censory that alone would offend someone? It would offend the person who wrote the book or made the movie.      There are many reasons why censory shouldnt be in libraries. My first reason is freedom of speech. People have the right to say or write whatever they believe. Just because it can offend someone doesnt mean you should take the opportunity to read away from the people it doesn't offend. Give people the full right to read and write whatever it is they want to.     Also if you use censorship then it's going to effect literature in a bad way. By using Censorship you will have to take the books that offend people off the shelves. Not having these books up on the shelves, means no one can read them. If no one can read the books, no one learns.     One more thing to take into consideration, is the authors money. Alot of times in the library if I see a book I really like, I'll go buy it. But taking these books off the shelves means no one will see them. The author's write these books so they can make a point and make money. If we take the books down, they dont make money and they dont make their intended point.     In conclution I think censory is overall a bad idea. One because of freedom of speech. Second is it could possibly drastically effect literature. Third is its taking away authors money and point of view. These are the important reasons I do not surrport censory.",3,3
4428,"A library card is one thing a kid always looked forward to. It's the first piece of identification that many kids have that they are allowed to carry around themselves.The card opens up a whole new world of entertainment and storys that can take you anywhere you want to go. Once a kid owned a library card, they were allowed to check out any book they wanted out of the huge selection of items in a library. But how do you keep a young child from checking out a book, movie, or magazine about inappropriate adult material? A solution to this problem should be formed so that people can be protected from material they don't want to see in a book, movie, or any other source of entertainment.     Libraries today normally have a specified children's section, where picture books and short stories litter the shelves. The rest of the building is a scattering of books and other materials sorted only by author name and genre. The only way to understand what the item is about is to flip through the pages or read the back cover and try to find a hint of how the plot goes. This could be dangerous at times because not all materials give a specific summary of what happens.      I once rented a movie expecting it to be a scary thriller about a killer in a trailer park. It ended up being scary for another reason, as multiple uncensored sex scenes were displayed throughout the first couple minutes of the feature. I had no idea the movie was going to involve scenes like that and I was disgusted that there was no warning. I believe items like that should be placed in a seperate area or at least be required to give a summary of the kind of offensive material in them. Libraries could collect viewer comments, allowing people who had checked out an item to write what they thought about it. People could then read these comments before checking out that item. Viewer comments would be a good way to get someones else's opinion on what the item contained before another decided to rent it.     Another effective way to help this problem would be to give materials a certain rating, like the ratings of movies when they come out in theaters. A specific rating would warn viewers or readers from checking out an item that is offensive or inappropriate. Libraries could also give specific age ranges according to the ratings on an item, not allowing anyone under a certain age limit to check out a book from the building. Ratings would help keep offensive books out of a child's hands, or that of anyone else who didn't want to be exposed.     Libraries hold all different kinds of materials about any subject you could think of. They can open a whole new world to learn and be entertained but also a world of inappropriate items. I believe items with offensive material should be either put in a seperate area, or given a certain rating in order to warn people before checking it out. Allowing viewers to make comments about the material could also be very helpful. Libraries are a wonderful place full of great stories and adventures, so they should not be polluted with offensive and inappropriate material",4,4
3562,"'hey', I believe that certain materials, such as book, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.        First, I know that people have different views appon things such as magazines, books, and music. And I also know that there are somethings that @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but they aren't offensive to other perople. Such as music there are all kinds of music out there. And I know that some people find rap music offensive and some doesnt. Because A lot of people that doesn't find it offensive relates to it.      Second, I feel that if the people that find it offensive would just ignore it then it wouldn't be a problem. Because I know that maybe there is a type of magazine, book, or even a type a music that they listen to is offensive to someone else they might not find it offensive but I bet someone else finds it offensive. So for them to judge these things wouldn't be right.           Third, I'm pretty sure that if something in the library was too offensive the library wouldn't have it. But maybe if we would take the time out and worry about our self instead of worrying about what's offensive and what's not then the world might be a better place. And yes i understand that people have different views but we shouldn't let that get to us.        So you can see, I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. Because there are billions of people on this earth and I doubt they would all give you the same answer. Because So many people have different opinions, and beliefs appon things.",3,3
3664,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:     I am writing to you today concerning cencorship in libraries.  I have had a select few instances throughout my life where I have read a book or magazine that to some @MONTH1 seem offensive and to others not at all.  However, I do have my own view point on the situation and I feel that @CAPS2 is my duty to inform you that I feel offensive books, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves.     Everyone has grown up and been taught different values and morals that are important to them. They stand for these values, but at the same time respect that other people have the right to believe differently than they do.  With the world the way @CAPS2 is now, violence can errupt from the simplest of things.  Putting books on public shelves for the public to read, can very easily cause outbursts and debates between people who have opposite opinions.  Offensive books and magazines put out for the public is asking for something bad to be a result.     My suggestion to you is to remove these offensive books.  This will create a safe and happy envioronment for all who visit public libraries,and other public places.  @CAPS2 will create fewer arguments between adults and set an example for younger children who are observing their parents behaviors.  Children follow in their parents' footsteps.  Observing bad behaviors from the parents due to offensive books does not teach the child how to act in a responsible way if they were put in this postion.  When our children grow up, we want them to beahve in a responsible way.  Offensive books not being put on shelves will hopefully create a healthful environment for appropriate behavior.     As a student, I want to grow up in a world that has people who are resepectful, happy, and responsible. I want people to get along with each other.  I feel that taking offensive books off shelves will help with this somewhat peaceful world I would like to live in.  Violence can be created through anything, and I feel that offensive books should be the last thing added to that.  Without offensive books for the public to read, will create a better environment for the people living today.",4,4
3259,"I dont see any reason why to take books off the shelves. If someone doesnt like a book, then they dont have to read it. Books are ment to entertain or inform people. There are books that talk about black people in a bad manner, but they still need to be out there so that people will know. Libraries are out to make money thats all. Let them make money, they can sell whatever they want.      If I had a library I would sell just about anything i could. people will: watch, listen, read anything. So why not sell it or rent it out. It's a honest way of making money.",2,2
4281,"Corrupt Censorship     @CAPS1 @MONTH1 occur when censorship decides to remove or block; showing certain media or readable content all pertains to the creator. In some cases, the distributor and less the author, director, or publisher, has no opinion on whether to display the product they have made, but from their own habit of making what they enjoy; it is the will from the store, person or etc. to display these materials. Libraries have an exponential option to publicly put up on their shelves or stock, but restricting too graphic material is all depended on the eduacational rules the library is equipted with.          Any type of content is art, art that should never be even considered to be changed or enhanced because it pertains to one artist. You can never remake, rewrite or recreate that visual material provided from the creator. And you are not aloud to, unless given permission to from the creator. Censoring or removing on the other hand, is permitted to the distributor. Their choice to publicly demonstrate something made by someone is all their choice.     Libraries for example, show that any given media or readable content is publicly displayed for anyone to see, so long as the audience fits their rules or criterias. In some instances, partial side of the audience will run across unexpected media and will have the inexecptional pursuasion to accept what is demonstrated. Though it is not the creators fault to ensure where their content is diplayed, but the audience's fault in whether to see that material. It is choice to read or see whatever you'd like, you aren't forced upon to follow through to what the distributor-let alone the creator- is offering. Enjoying the topic or material is optional.   When you have options in front of you, any given topics or subject to read or follow, it it your will to chose to read or see them. Enjoying is even more harder, but when a library's limit is basically the sky, you should not force it on them to throw out the book just because the censorship isnt up to your level. It is not the library to blame, but your own. Everyone has different views on certain content and it isnt your obligation to view it.      When you take down materials @CAPS2 intended for those who chose to view and enjoy, you destroy not @CAPS2 art a creator has made, but the joy that filled a viewers taste. Libraries shouldnt exceptionalize for certain people's expectations because not everyone finds censorship a solution. Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work i abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so deos everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'",4,3
3427,"Do I think we should have to take books off of shelves? No  we should not have to take certain things off of library shelves. Think of it in your own perspective. For example, say you like horror books. If someone else doesn't like horror and you do, and they take it off of the shelves, how mad would you be.     I like @CAPS1 magazines. Magazines like @CAPS1 @CAPS2, or @ORGANIZATION1. If there is a bad picture or anything in it they took it off. My perspective is that if you don't like what you see then put the book, magazine or whatever it might be up. Don't just sit there and complain, because how would you feel if the same thing happened to you?     I have had personal experience with these kinds of problems. At my school, we used to have magazines like @ORGANIZATION1. Just non-hurtful things. All it took though was one person to complain about it, and boom! They were gone. @CAPS1 fanatics like me don't like to see our favorite things gone. So really, what is the problem?     The problem is that people can't handle what they see. It is understandable to a certain point. Like if your a very religous person, then yes i understand that you couldn't look at those things. But when you do it just to spite someone, then that is very hurtful.     Finally, i just want to say that if you have a problem, keep it to yourself. Just because you don't like something, doesnt mean someone else won't. You wouldnt want it to happen to you",4,4
3953,"'@CAPS1 are you reading' asked mom. I immediatley hid the book behind my back, knowing she wouldn't like the idea of me reading such an in depth book. Some parent don't like for their kids to read some content. If it's not okay at home it shouldn't be okay at school. There is some subjects that maybe we shouldn't but we do because our parents say no. Removing said subjects will remove the chance of disobeying or parents, and coping behavor from book.                There are books, movies, magazines and music that is 'cool', but not all that appropriate. Some movies and music use offensive language and actions that some kids pick up on and refelct actors, actresses and artists. Soon they start making a name for themselves by using such language or actions and eventually becomes known as the bad kid. Students such as myself are inferior to being popular or noticed, so they feel the need to do things to become noticed. Most things students model after are the things they see, hear, or watch, such as the media.      It is wise to set censors in the libraries, for students. Though some students don't nessicearily want censorship in libraries, it is only for their best intrest to remove materials that are offensive. It will make students including myself better people by not learning of the things we hear about or watch. I think by using censorship it will help student to make the decison at home to to become involved in such thing.      I have noticed that students often watch how movie stars and famous people act, if they are a fan or the famous person then they are more likey to model after them and do the thing they do. Lets say I was a fan of @PERSON1 and I read that she stole something. Being a fan of her I would either find someone else to model after or do as she does because it cool. If I did the things @PERSON2 done my parents would most likely kill me, and if I got luck somehow and they didn't then I would go to jail for sure.      So  in conclusion, I think censorship is important in libraires because it insures the well being of students and protects them form things they odn't need to be part of. I would respect the idea of censory in my school becaus eI would know it is only there to help me. I hope that all students see that it is important not to be subject to violence, sex, drugs, drama, through movies, music, magazines, or book",4,4
3486,I believe that in libraries certain materials should not be removed from the shelves even if it is offensive because if someone does not like that particular item they could always go and get another item. I have been to a library and nothing at all was offensive to me or anyone else. If you dont like that the library displays all the 'OFFENSIVE' items then you dont have to go it is an personal choice. Everyone has their own choice on what they listion to or read it doesnt matter as long as that particular person likes that sort of thing. That is what I believe in,1,1
3818,"I do not believe that any material should be removed from library shelves.  I stand frmly with this because it is a choice to read material that is found offensive.  I would not expect a young child to seek out inappropiate materials because they are not interested in them.  Just as I would not expect an adult to go searching for a little kid book.  Basically there is a maturity barrier that seperates what each age level is interested in reading.     There is no point in removing any material from libraries because you would accomplish nothing.  People who would get offended mainly children are already exposed to violent videogames which glorify war and violence.  And you can not just go ahead and remove material that you think is offensive.     If you removed offensive material from libraries then I guess you would have to shut down the internet as well.  A child could much more easily go to a computer and find anything offensive they want to find with the click of a button.  Also at a library their are age level restrictions on cards that prevent a child from checking out offensive material.     Some people might enjoy material that is offensive.  If material is removed  alot of people would be upset that libraries do not carry what they wanted.  There would be alot of complaints, and problems.  And some people might stop going to the library because the content was limited..     The best thing to do is allow libraries to have whatever material they want to have.  Many people will be satasified, and most people will be happy",4,4
3433,"Libraries, not many people like them, but most people do. Libraries are almost in every town. People like to go there to read book, get on the computers, and do activities with their families. But there are some things that people would really want to do things there but they cannot because of their age or so, or it just might be prohibited at all times. Do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone?    Most people really do not think that you must always go to the library for things because if you are a irresponsible person with all the damage that you have done to the item that you have checked out or how late you turn it could be the same ammount of money on buying that item. If you are a responsible person then you are fine. But some do not think that the libraries should be putting stuff there if they are not going to let any one touch it or check it out.    So if they are not going to let one person get an item from the library then it should be removed from there, because there will be at least one person who will want to get that item and it would be rude if the librarian tells you no you cannot have that.     Libraries should just stick to the same old same old a section for kids with kid books. A section for the middle schoolers and the teenagers. A section for the high schoolers and the adults and mostly everything will work out fine. Just want to make it fair for everyone since it is the public library of your town.     Now that some facts and opinions have been stated hopefullly the libraries and librariens do think about what they are going to put and what they are not going to put on the shelves of a public library to make it fair for everyone. So do you think the advantages and disadvantages at the library are fair enough for everyone",3,2
4432,"Do I think that certain books, music, movies, magazines should be removed from our librarys. No i dont think they should be removed, they could be placed in another part of the library away from all the other books that aren't offensive.     If they did decide to remove these books are kids would have a hard time learning about the truth. Book publishers put only what they want are kids to learn. Most of the time they leave out bits and pecies about what really happened. So if they took the offensive books, music, movies, and magazines out, a lot of kids would just go home everyday and sit around or cause trouble. From my own experience, I enjoyed reading, listening, and watching the offensive materials they want to take out of our librarys. So if you don't like the offensive materials then don't even look at them, that will solve your problem, and teach your children that to.     Overall I think they should keep the offensive materials. If people still complain, move it to another part of the library, in seperate room or somethin of that kind. This should solve the problem of kids reading, listening, and watching these kinds of things.",3,3
3893,"Censorship for books? Never thought I'd see the day. But, that doesn't necessarily mean I approve or agree. Just because I don't approve or agree doesn't mean I do not oppose it. I find that need taking a step back and arguing both sides is sufficient and fair. Shall we?      Among others, I find that if you censor one thing, you censor them all. Public items such as televisions, radios, magazines, and even books have wriggled their way into our not so perfect world. Yes, there are crimes and indecencies happening as you read this. But, is it entirely fair to say that these public items have completely influenced and brainwashed children into early adulthood? Maybe. Then again, maybe not.      It is true that children, at their youngest, are easily molded and cut out into who they will permenantly be, or at least until they're old enough to form their own opinions on certain topics.For instance, when I was younger, my cousin, who happens to be just a few years older than me, started to like a certain thing. After spending time with her for an elongated amount of time, I started to 'like' it too. I found myself obsessed with it. Now, before you start getting it into your mind that it was something bad, I can assure you, it was nothing other than stacks of @CAPS1 cards. Anyway, it wasn't until later that my mother informed me that it wasn't really my interest. It was hers. I modeled after her likes and dislikes. Every other child in the world has done something similar. What makes anybody think they wouldn't do the exact same after listening to uncensored music, watching uncensored television, or reading an uncensored book or magazine?      On the other hand, it would be unfair to take away some books that people find to be improper or indecent. If that were the case, nearly every book would be out of sight, but not out of mind. Today, you can't turn on the radio without hearing something about sex, drugs, alcohol, or smoking. Now, those things are a lot more accessable to anybody. You can't turn on the computer without advertisements for porn or other sexually crude websites popping up on your screen. Books have gotten out of hand, as well.      The world nowadays has gotten ridiculous and out of place. But in the end, I'm sticking to my original opinion: If you censor one thing, censor them all. It's only fair. Radios, television, movies, and even @CAPS2's have been censored. Books are not as innocent as they seem, anymore. So yes, my final opinion is that libraries should, in fact, censor their books, or at least make an effort to. Libraries are places to learn and have fun doing so, not have a mental scar leading back to what they read in a 'harmless' little book.",4,4
3406,"Offensive literature, sexual content, disagreeable topics. Books all have those things to someone some where. It would be impossible to get rid of all of the books that offended everyone and still have books left. There are many reasons why censorship is pointless and wrong. Censorship only causes curiosity. Censoring books could take away from learning. The real world is not censored so books should not be either.     Consorship only causes curiosity. Young kids every day are told what to do and what not to do. Many people know that children are most likely to want to do exactly the opposite of what they are told to do. Being censored from things makes people want to rebel and learn the truth. No one likes to be told what they can and can not do. The same goes for being told what you can and can not read. No one wants the truth cut out of  their reading materials.      Censoring books could take away from learning. In school children are required to read many different books in their english classes. Some books, depending on the teacher, have what some would consider offensive language and topics. What some people do not understand is that reading those things are a part of life. Reading foul language would not be any more offensive than if someone was to use the same foul language in front of you in real life. In fact, the real life situation would seem to be more offensive. If we are censored from these things how will we learn that they exist.     The real world is not censored so books should not be either. You can not go walking down the street and expect a loud beep to randomly play over someone's foul banter everytime they curse. When someone says something offensive in the real world you have to learn to deal with it appropriately and maturely. We can not cut out peoples offensive banter in real life so why should we do it in our reading material. Has no one ever heard of freedom of speech? That ammendment was created for a reason, to let @CAPS1 speek their beliefs.     Everywhere we look today things are being censored and 'cleaned up' to make others happy who @MONTH1 be offended by whatever it is they are censoring. Sometimes it is appropriate for offensive language or topics to be written about. People need to be able to speek their minds and beliefs. But people also need to be able to have constructive critisism and be mature about offensive writing. Everyone will be offended in one way or another some time in their life by something they will read or already have read. It is just life",4,3
4762,"What if some one found your favorite book offensive? Inapporate materials do need to be kept from young minds of children.On the other hand, you can not sheild people from things they should know or already know. Everyone has different things that they think are offensive, so one person might think a book is so bad it should be recalled from the shelves but an another person @MONTH1 see no problem with it.     Children need to be protected from materials that @MONTH1 hurt them in some way. Children do what they see and hear, so they are liable to try and cop harmful things they read . Bad influences can be even magazines with famous celeberties being caught breaking the  law or doing bad things and young minds see that as 'cool' and @MONTH1 try to follow tha example.     Children and young people see and hear a lot worse things at home, television and even at school than in some books. Children need to be protect but, you can't baby proof life. They willl be introduced to plenty of bad influnces in there life time but, it should be the parent's job to teach their kids to say no and stay away from bad things. Kids can learn so much worse things from something at the library by just setting at home.     Libraries are places for use public and the public covers a wide amount of different kinds of people and someone will always find something bothersome with somting or another. People have different views, believes and religions, and, books on these might be offensive to some but, the life style of another. Like The  quote by Katherine Paterson, said if we take off the shelves every book or material that somone finds offensive there will be no books in the libraries at all.     Yes, there are books that are not always very presentable to a certain group of people but, they should have a right to be read if their is someone who wants to read them. It is not the librarys job to be prejudice against certain books for because someone does't agree with it. Books should be a wide varitey like the people who are reading them. Also children are protect from books if they have learned morals that allow them to make mature choices",4,4
3309,"I beleive it is wrong to remove books from library shelves even if they are found offensive. I have three reasons to support this statement. These reasons are knowledge, different sections of the library, and freedom. I will explain these reasons below but before I begin I would like to add that most people want to censor things that they fear.     If a book is removed from a shelf because someone finds it offensive then the next person who comes along looking for that book can not access it. How is that fair? In life there are many things that can offend people but thats life, you have to learn to let those things go. Everyone has a right to form their own views and oppinions on things, but they can not if they do not read other people's oppinions. Reading expands our vacabulary, at any age. Just because you do not like something does not mean someone else also can not like it. You have to give them a chance to form an oppionion.     Library's are everywhere. If you are concerned about your children finding books that you do not want them to see then take them to a library with sections. All libraries are broken down in sections. Keep your children in the 'children' section and there should not be any concerns in that area. Once your children get older allow them to roam the library and develope an oppinion on what types of books they enjoy most.      We live in @LOCATION1, which since founded has been all about freedom. Some people do not have the money to buy books, or internet, So these people rely on public libraries. If they look for books and can not find a subject that interests them they will not read. They could even be looking for a specific book and not be able to find it because it was taken off the shelf. There is also a religion conflict. There are many different versions of the @CAPS1 but, many different religions. People come from all backgrounds so if they do not beleive in the @CAPS1 do we take that off the shelves too?      In closing I would like to add that I can also see why people would want to censor certain things. However most of the things people do not like to see are things they fear. These people can not hide from reality, not everything in the world is good, so let's not pretend everything is perfect and do our best to contribute to the wellness of society. What better way than letting everyone read whatever they wish",4,4
4212,"Certain materials such as books, movies, magazines, and comics can be offensive to certain people. When we look at a comic and see that the writer of the comic has said something offensive, what @MONTH1 seem offensive to you @MONTH1 not be offensive to anyone else. Certain pictures or writings that seem full of knowledge and vibrance to you @MONTH1 be completely something else in someone elses eyes.     How many humans inhabit the world today? About @NUM1 billion, researchers say. If you think about it, each and every one of those @NUM1 billion minds thinks differently. If a librarian takes away the knowledge that you find so vibrant, it is like taking away a person's ability to learn.      In the world today, many teenagers and young adults are becoming more involved. What that teenager reads in that magazine article could spark a whole new reason to help the world. For all you know, the magazine could have gotten the young adult or scientist one step closer to finding the cure for cancer. How could you just take that away? Again, the magazine could be offensive to a person who @MONTH1 have cancer or a doctor who treats cancer, but will they be offended when their cancer is cured? Or when the doctor can successfully say that all of the cancer in your body has gone away?     If we take everything away that could possibly be offensive to other people, we might as well just take all the books, movies, magazines, and comics away that have ever been created. Once again, something that @MONTH1 be offensive to you would not be offensive to another person, because about @NUM1 billion minds do not all think alike. If reading materials were taken away that are found offensive, our ability to learn and grow as humans might as well be taken away as well.",4,4
3392,"Everybody does not have the same opinion on censorship. Some people don't like books and movies with profanity in it, but some other people @MONTH1. Also somebody @MONTH1 like the scary mystery books and movies, but others @MONTH1 not. I think all movies, music, and books are acceptable.     I can understand why some people @MONTH1 want to remove some movies or books from the libraries. They want to because they are inappropriate, but the thing is, they are not inappropriate to everyone. A lot of people like the books and the movies with profanity in them because it brings out the real in the book.      Personally I think that some magizines need to just stop being made. For example; @CAPS1 magizines are horrible to me. There is nothing but nude women in there. I say that the women don't respect themselves enough to cover up, but there are other opinions. Others @MONTH1 think it is creative and beautiful how the women look in the magizines, and it isn't jus magizines it's movies also. More and more movies are advertising sex and drugs in their movies.     Everybody has their on opinion on censorship and everybody can not get what they want. I think if you are offended by a movie, music lyric, book, or a magizine don't read or watch it",3,4
3965,"Dear @CAPS1,                    To @CAPS2 Or @CAPS3 To @CAPS2     @CAPS5 it wrong to ban a book?  It has come to my notice that this @CAPS5 exactly what our library has just thought about doing to any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that any person finds offensive.  To this I disagree.  The world @CAPS5 a better place to live, when everyone has a level playing field.  Some information @CAPS5 sensitive, but that same information should never be blocked completely for nothing more than just the @CAPS6 itself. Our country @CAPS5 based on a freedom of press and speech, to deny that @CAPS5 to deny our livelihood as a country.  To solve a situation as this, we must all create a type of checks and balances system to keep the information out there, but also protecting it from younger ones until the time @CAPS5 right from a guardian's viewpoint.         Our country has many problems, but a few of them are @CAPS3 the core values that are upheld in the @CAPS6.  In the @CAPS6 it @CAPS5 stated that we have the freedom of press and speech.  This means that we can publish anything, no matter the inappropriateness of the matter.  This also protects any reader from being denied the right to have information at their fingertips.  There was just an example of this, inside the @LOCATION1,when a local library had to allow any person wanting to look up porn on library computers because of the laws stated in the @CAPS6.  However much some @MONTH1 dislike the thought of this much freedom, we cannot ban works purely based on the discretion of some.     The world @CAPS5 a contantly changing place, with almost nothing a given constant.  This @CAPS5 the exact same for information of all types.  No one can say what will or won't be accepted in our society in the future.  At this moment many sexual subjects are quite offensive to many and are viewed unacceptable to the younger generation.  The only problem with this @CAPS5 the ease at which this type of information can be gotten.  The internet @CAPS5 the very place where so much information passes through, be it good or bad.  To block all of this information just can't be done, but to restrict it @CAPS5 our only hope.     To to create such a restriction, our library can needs to have a type of checks and balances sytem that could allow those with orderly consent or those of age to get a hold of these types of works. Those of age @NUM1 or older could easily be allowed into sections containing these works, but those under @NUM1 would have to have a guardian's consent before allowed in these sections.  A perfect example of this would be off of '@CAPS10 @CAPS11 and The @CAPS12 of @CAPS13' when @CAPS10 @CAPS5 @CAPS3 allowed in the restricted section of the library unless he has a signed pass from a teacher.  That type of protection would still allow the works to be released to the public, but still keeping the younger generation from having any freedom to look at inappropriate items for their age.     As humans we crave information, whether it be via watching, listening, or reading.  To block any part of this experience @CAPS5 to block our full potential.  Many things are offensive, but then again much of life @CAPS5 offensive.  Our founding fathers knew this and took it with them while writing the @CAPS6, and now we have a @CAPS6 that protects all our information.  This @CAPS5 a very good thing, but some things need to be upheld from those too young to understand the meaning of them.  We need to protect our freedoms, but also protect our children.  To do this we must create a program that allows those that want view what they want, and those that are too young view what they are allowed by their guardians.",4,4
3883,"My say would be no. becuse all that was history, say you hade like a kkk thing or anything like that. say you had a wighting aport but need the information for that. you would need information for that and that information would have notes,dates and other thing",1,1
4051,"Libraries.     What things are found in libraries? Well libraries contain more then just books. They can have music, movies, magazines, books, and much more. All of the things are not for just one particular age. Libraries have things for people of all ages, even though some do not like many of the materials found in them.      The library in my town has certin place for chilrden, teens, adults, and for @CAPS1-rated thing. Not all people agree with what should be aloud in a public area. Libraries try to make everyone that comes find something that might be intersting to them. Even though some of the things they chose might be different then what the public expects.     When I go to the library I think I would mind is i saw some @CAPS1-rated thing. Even though I think everyone should have the freedom to read, watch, listen, and hear about what they want. I think making areas where children can't go is a good way of letting people get what they want to get and not exposing it to younger people. Haveing these areas would help parents and childern feel alot better about what they would hear or see at a library.     What can be done about this problem? Even though it @MONTH1 cost more or be to dificult for an ower of a library to do, I think that building rooms for different age groups would be an good thing to do. If smaller children see thing such as violace, durgs, and sex, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to do. Most parents try and keep there kids away for those parts of library but don't always sucide. So there for I think that building rooms for these area is the right thing to do.     Even though we all think different things should or shoulden't be seen in public, we can't stop them from being there. We could try to contain them to where only people that would like to see them do. It would just cost a little more money then some are willing to spend, but if you think of when you were a child would you of liked to see some of those things? If u ever have kids whould you like for them to see it? I would hope not. So try and make the better choic when u find unupropret things for unger viewers.",3,4
4125,"Keep it on the Shelf!     What types of things do you go to the library for? Some go for books and others go just to relax in a quiet environment. Yes, the library is mostly used for books and studying, but there are many other things that libraries contain. Movies, magazines, music, etc., are all found in a library. Now, say you had to listen to a specific song, read a certain book, or review an article in a certain magazine, and you can't find it at the library because they have been removed because they are found to be offensive. All people have different views on what is and isn't offensive. Everything like books, music, magazines, and movies should all have their place in a library, regaurdless of the material.     Books can be used for many things. Some read just for the enjoyment and others read because it is assigned to them or they need to research some things. Books give information and knowledge that some people need desperately. What if you can't find that book because someone said that its material is inappropiate? What are you supposed to do about your research paper now? If a book is needed it should be able to be found on the shelf in a library and not be taken out because of the content of its pages.     Music is a great way to clear your mind and relax. Some music found in libraries can be somewhat offensive to some people. What if the only place you can find your favorite music is at your public library? You walk in and they no longer have it because it is considered to be offensive. Now you can no longer listen to the sounds that calm you down or modivate you to get your day started. Music should remain in libraries because of the cultural and educational sounds that most cannot find at their local music store.     Magazines are another great form of reading material found in a library. Magazines are a great way to stay up to date with the latest fashions and great dessert receipes. Without magazines our world wouldn't be able to keep up with the things that advance in our world everyday. Magazines show us the hottest trends, the gossip in the celebrity world, and some great facts from educational magazines. Without the magizines in the library we probably wouldn't know anything about our advancing world.     You can find movies anywhere, but some believe that you can only find the really good and old movies at the library. The library has educational movies for children that @MONTH1 not be available anywhere else. They also have old classic movies that aren't even around anymore. The library has many movies that you wouldn't be able to find in our advanced world today.     Libraries hold a lot of important books, movies, music, and magazines. Without out most of that, regaurdless of the material, we probably wouldn't know as much as we know today. The library has always been a place where you go to find exactly what you want and you know that they will have it. Removing these things from the shelves can be taking some history right out of our lives. All of theses resources should stay on the shelves regaurdless of their material.",4,4
3641,"I believe that if you are at a library or movie store, or where ever and there are books,movies, magazines, or cd's that you think are offensive that they should most likley be taken off of the shelf.     Have you ever walked into a store and seen something not approprite for little kids, and you get a little embarassed yourself?I know I have at least one point and time in my life. Which is why I believe that it should be removed from the store, or at least the shelves.     I always try to think of how my grandparents would feel if they new what kind of music most teen's are listening to today. There is so much terrible language and talking about violence and bad things that really just isnt appropriate for anyone to hear, or even talk about.      Some people feel differant about this, and some people take it a little to serious, but you have to remember everyone has their own opinion",2,3
3003,"The world in full of offensive material, and there almost nothing we can do for it. These books that we leave behind influence the future of our society. These materials should not be removed from the shelves of libraries because it is part of a large varity knowledge and the library is not the last place someone will look for such material.      On the logical side of this, the more a person knows the more power one has. That doesn't mean that some items such as centain types of music of movies are inapropate his or her age. Some partents get really  offensive when they see something slightly inapropate but the thing to remember is that, those so called little children will sooner or later see such items; it is just a part of growing up.      In the last paragraph, it suggested that a person should have large mass of imformation to choose from becasue there is not a perfect little soul and everyone has amounts of cruiosity. For example somethings like @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1 are taught in school and could be consided dangerous. In @ORGANIZATION1 we learn the ways of atoms and  make make perdictions of how they will react with other chemicals. When in the lab, students are required to wear safety material because of the dangerous enviroment. The same goes for @CAPS1, one learns about how to live a healthy life and this requires students to learn about the human body such as the reproductive systems. In these @CAPS3 we learn better how the world works around us and with this we learn things that can be dangerous.     With everything that we do there is postive and negative outcomes. What I am suggesting is that, we need to find a healthy balance of what is really needed and the materials that are strickly entertainment, and those items should be removed. If it has some purpose behind it, then it holds a place but if it is some magazine talking about drama it apears very useless.      In this large world there alway was and always will be people or material that are a bad influnce. Yet this is all a matter of perception and everyone has different torances and values. With this on going problem, we shall make this judgment with the best of our ablities, based off of our values",4,4
3065,"From my own observations I do not beleive that any materials should be removed from libraries.  All students have the right to read/learn about different subjects.  Even if that includes some of them being offensive.     Some subjects might be considerderd offensive, like the holocaust for example.  If we didnt learn about what happened during that horrific time it could possibly happen again without us even knowing that it has happened before.  But it is the students choice to read about that subject or to simply ignore it if it is cosidered offensive.     In conclusion I do not beleive that materials in libraries should be censored or removed from shelves.  People need to learn a little about everything that goes on in this world to be a better, more educated, well-rounded individual.",3,3
3445,"I personally don't believe they should us censorship in libraries. I feel as though no one has the right to say people are or aren't allowed to enjoy certain material just because someone @MONTH1 thing that it is offensive because, thats just one persons opinion. What's one mens trash is another mens gold, what one person finds offensive could be sawt out by millions. Plus in todays world if everything was censored there would be nothing left not even church because everyone has there own opinion and there own belief. Which would eventually eliminate everything because there will always be at less one person who thinks something is offensive in someway, shape, or form. If everything was censored people wouldn't even be able to exspress themselfs.    If cenorship was used everywhere schools wouldn't be able to teach half of the material they teach today and kid would have nothing to involved. Author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I for one completely agree with this quote. It's true as I have already stated if everything was cenored there be nothing left to be enjoyed.    Think about it this way would you like someone telling you that your not allowed to read or listen to certain material just because someone felt as though it was offensive and thought it should be taken away from the public? I'm pretty sure that would make most people upset exspecially if they're a adult. I feel as though everyone has the right to choose what they read and listen to. So if you ever get asked if censorship in libraries should be allowed then think back to everything I've said before you give your answer. Once they start censoring what everyone can read and listen to then they'll feel as though they can censor any and everything and control peoples lives.",4,4
3875,"Censorship is one of many important issues facing the world today.  Many argue that materials considered offensive are damaging to society, and should not be tolerated.  Others believe that freedom of speech is a universal right that should extend to any and all forms of human expression.  The issue is further complicated by the concept of what is and is not appropriate for children.  Are there materials that are acceptable for adults, but not kids?  Questions such as this have plagued humanity for hundreds of years, and there is no simple solution.       Today, so many people think of censorship as a bad word.  In fact, there is nothin inherently wrong with the concept of censorship.  It is only when people begin to abuse their power and censor materials that should not be censored that problems arise.  For example, many countries have restrictions on selling and owning copies of '@PERSON2,' the book that @PERSON1 wrote as a sort of mission statement for @LOCATION1.  While many of the ideas contained within the book are horribly offensive, it still should not be censored.  People have the right to read the book and form their own opinions on @PERSON1's teachings, it is not the government's place to decide for them.  While oppressive dictatorship and mass-murder are crimes, reading about them is not.     There are few materials available that should rightfully be censored and taken out of adult hands.  If someone understands what they are reading, and are able to form an educated opinion on the material, then nobody has the right to stop them from expanding their knowledge, or expressing themself by creating similar material.  However, the issue changes completely when one considers children.  If adults want to view pornography, or read accounts of extreme violence, that is their business.  However, those concepts are obviously inappropriate for children, and any decent parent wouldn't want their young kids filling their heads with such things.  Children need to be slowly and gently introduced to these concepts so they can fully understand them.  In the case of children, careful censorship is necessary for healthy development.       When it comes to libraries, there are very few materials that should be banned.  If libraries are meant to be places of learning, then one has no right to limit the information they contain.  However, that does not mean there should not be any limitations.  Libraries should offer a children's section, as many do, that would contain materials only appropriate for youngsters.  Then, it becomes the parents' responsibilty to ensure that their child stays in that section.  When a parent believes the child is ready to explore the adult section, they are free to take their kid there.  This system gives parents the ability to keep their children away from harmful material, without taking it out of the hands of adults.  Many would argue that unsupervised children could gain access to inappropriate material, but that is really an issue that needs to be handled by parents, not the library.  After all, it's better that a few kids see something they shouldn't have than all adults have to read censored material.       In conclusion, censorship is a concept that has its place in society, but must be used very carefully.  When the goal is to protect people, especially children, from harmful material, it can be used sparingly.  However, when those in power use censorship to attack ideas they disagree with, it becomes a form of oppression.  Above all else, people must be free to educate themselves, form their own opinions, and express themselves.  If someone doesn't like a piece of material, they can leave it alone, but they should never try to take it out of someone else's hands",5,4
3904,"Many people in the @LOCATION1 read. Books, magazines, news papers, and music are a great passing time. I enjoy reading books about people with special powers; such as necromancers. If we were to take such books that offend someone out of our libraries, what would we have left? I, for one, don't like reading @ORGANIZATION1 books, which seem to be the only type of book that wouldn't offend someone, unless they have some severe hatred towards letters.      Think for a moment about what you like. Think about your interest in music, art, and the style of books or magazines that you read. Now imagine all of those gone from the one place you can get away from screaming children or annoying neighbors: the library. You @MONTH1 be baffled as to why all of your loves have dissappeared. That book you love, the one about necromancers, it's offensive to @CAPS1 because only @CAPS2 has the power of waking the dead. The song that you have had stuck in your head all day is now no longer online. Its use of certain words are offensive to those with 'sensitive' ears.      If I were to walk into a library and find that all the 'offensive' works had been band, I would be shocked. Every one in the universe finds certain things offensive. My @CAPS3 @CAPS4 teacher thinks that rap and hip-hop or pop songs are offensive to women and their bodies, but I think that some of those songs hold a different meaning. If everything offensive were to be taken away, what would be left? Nothing that a teenager or an adult would want to read. Heck, @PERSON1' works are offensive to some people, they think he was crazy, and who wants their children to read a book written by a bafoon?      Also, the less the library contains, the less people go. Libraries would soon close because everything is being found as offensive. All of the books we had hoped to read would have to be bought online, if it were still allowed.     For all of the Book @CAPS5 out there, finding an attention-getting, eye-opening book is like finding buried treasure. It's an event that changes your life, makes your blood rush, and leaves you hanging onto your seat. It's an adventure played in your head, one that you set the specific details of each character, or it's the book that provides the knowledge that feeds your brain every time a new sentence is stored. Taking away everything offensive is like having a child being taken away, you can't replace that love with a distraction",4,4
4130,"I believe that if something or someone offends you, you have the right to take a stand. You shouldn't have to deal with it. If something is offensive in your library, it has no right to be there. A library is supposed to be a helpfull place. Who would want to sit back and watch a raciest movie? Who would want to have a little kid watching something sexual in a movie? Magazines can even develope a lot of problems. Muisc can be straight offensive.      If a young adult or a child reads or watches a movie that is raciest, it teaches them bad things. Racism is a very hurtful thing. What you see or read can really have an affect on you. You @MONTH1 not realise that it is wrong. It could have you saying hurtful things to a differant race. If a person isn't raciest and they see something that is, it could offend them. They @MONTH1 feel like they 'cool'. They go out and say raciest things. It makes them feel good. Later on they feel guilty. All because of a movie or book. If a movie is making fun of your race, it hurts. Being made fun of hurts. It is technicly bullying. Bullying can lead to suicide. Who cares if someone is black or white? We are all the same deep down inside. Movies like this should be banned from public libraries.      Movies today can have pretty much anything they want in them. Sex, drugs, cursing, etc. Kids can get by with watching them without anyone saying anything. The librarian just swipes your card, then you have the movie.They @MONTH1 not know right from wrong. If they see someone doing drugs or having sex, they might think that it is cool. They @MONTH1 go out and do it. We do not need movies like this in our public library. We should make it a lot harder for kids to try to get movies like this. These moives can also offend us. Make us feel uncool. Make us feel like we have to go out and try it.      In magizines today, they make everyone look so perfect. These people can offend you. Young teenage girls or even boys are the ones mostly looking at magizines. If you see @PERSON1 in a magizine, you begin to want to look like her. You see how skinny she is. She is tan. She has perfect skin. Its normal for someone to be jeleous. We are only human. Sometimes these images get to us. We @MONTH1 starve ourselves to try to be skinny. That can be very dangerous to your health. These girls knock our confidence down. Into today's society, people stive for popularity. They want to look perfect. They want all the guys to stair. We use the girls in the magizine to helps us know what we want to look like. You should love who you are and what you look like. You are unique. No one has to be skinny to be pretty. Magizines can be offensive.      In today's society music is horrible. Rap, country, or rock music. Some of the lyrics can really offend people. The words get in your head everytime you hear the song. If you really take the time to look up lyrics to a song, you will realise that they will let you say anything. I can't name how many songs I know, just beeing a teenager, that make fun of something. For example, there is a song by the band @ORGANIZATION1. It is called 'I must be emo'. It makes fun of people who are unique in their own way. Some lines from the song are, '@CAPS1 I get depressed, I cut my wrists in every direction'. How can you make fun of someone who does self harm. Depression and self harm are a big thing in today's society. Their is nothing funny about it. If someone who hurts themselves hears this, think of what could happen. It would really offend them! They could go and cut theirselves even more. They could try suicide. In the song it also makes fun of gay people. It makes fun of the way 'emo' people look. 'I look like I am dead and dress like a homo', is another line from the song. I don't know about you but to me that would be terribly offensive! We need to get these types of songs out of our libraries.      We should have a say to what is in our public library. The library is ment to be a good place. Anyone can go their. We are all unique in our own ways. If something is offensive to you, you have the right to stand up for yourself. We need to make offensive books, movies, magazines, etc., harder to get a hold of.",4,4
4268,"I think that some books should be banned from libraries that are offensive or use certain words against people, I think that should apply to highschool libraries because it really would matter in elementeries because they wouldn't know what some things mean. If a class were to read an offensive book and someyone in the class from the opposite race that reads the book others could get affended and it could start a fight.     Some high schoolers could get affended quicker than others and which could cause a lot of problems so by avoiding that there should be votes on books that should be banned or not be aloud to be read in class or in school period. Im pretty sure people would think its dumb to ban books but trust it me it would solve a lot of problems, but it all comes down to whats acceptable and whats not without hurting other peoples feeling and putting them down.     I bet all the time in classes theres been a story that has been read that has talked about races which makes others not feel comfortable, and theres always that person that always trys to make fun of something, but if I were in this situation I would try my best to not let others get to me and interfer with my grades and performance. I would just ignore them as much as possible and if it did start getting annoying I would talk to my counselor about trying to talk to that person individually or just removing me from class. I'm pretty sure most schools wouldnt tolerate this type of behavior but you will always have those kind of kids you just have to ignore.               You should never not go to school thinking you don't fit in just because someyone is making fun of your race or how you look. They just try to make the day harder on you and all you have to do is ignore them or report it and hopefully it is taken care of",3,3
4569,"Everyone has their own opinion about certain things in life. Maybe its politics; it could be a sports team. Everyone has a right to their own opinion. As for reading materials, the opinions could be endless and even painful to hear.      Opinions of some books and media type materials are biased. People could often be offended by the materials that can be accessed through a public library. For instance, let's say a grandmother and her grandchild are at the public library. The grandchild picks up a self-help book and starts to read. Later the grandmother reads it and finds out it says everything opposite of what the grandchild was taught about life by herself and her parents. To the grandmother, @CAPS1 is offensive.      Through observation, I have noticed when a person picks up 'an offensive book' and reads a little of it, they tend to put it right back where they found it. It obviously isn't hard to do. So why should a book be taken out of a library when all you have to do is set it down and leave it? The same goes for music, movies, and magazines. If you don't like the music, don't listen to it. If you don't think it would be a 'nice' movie, don't go out and see it. If the magazine seems raunchy, don't buy it.      @PERSON1 said it well, that if we took all the offensive books off the shelf '...then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 statement is as true as any statement could be. What would be left? Everyone has an opinion and likely someone will always find it offensive. Therefore offensive books and media should be allowed to stay on the shelves.      Whether or not you find a book, movie, music, or magazine that is offensive, why fret over it? It's just easier to move on and forget it. Ignorance isn't all bad",3,4
4698,"There are things in this world that are relative. Censorship is one of them. Relative means that one person has a different view than that of another. Censorship is when a person or organization in authority does not allow people to see things that they believe are inappropriate. One phrase that is very important to censorship is 'things that they believe.' @CAPS1 is inappropriate to one person could be deemed viewable to another. This should not be decided by one person or even one group that believes they know @CAPS1 is socially acceptable or politically correct. Censorship in libraries are not a good thing.     @PERSON3 and @CAPS2 walk into a library, and there is a magazine on the rack that depicts a person standing over a two hundred pound, twenty four point, state record, whitetail deer with with a gun in their hand. @PERSON3 is a firm believer in providing for his family and the rights given to an individual in the second ammendment of the @LOCATION1 constitution. Even if that means killing an animal for its resources. For some there is pride in harvesting an animal and knowing that they provided that meat. @PERSON3 will see the magazine as an opportunity. He might learn tips from the magazine, or find some new gear that he thinks could be useful.      @CAPS2 on the other hand is a conservative. She believes killing is wrong and inhumane. She goes to the store and buys her meat from the freezer section. @CAPS2 prefers not to know where her meat came from. She will view this magazine as inappropriate. Again, censorship is relative to the person looking over the material. Does that mean that just because @CAPS2 thinks the magazine is inappropriate, it should be taken off of the shelf so that someone like @PERSON3 can not read it, appreciate it, and gain knowledge from it? That choice is up to @CAPS2 not to read the magazine, not to the librarian. @CAPS2 is responsible for her own views and choices. She is entitled to them. @PERSON3 is entitled as well. Leave the choice to the reader.     Over in the book section there are @PERSON1 and @PERSON2. @PERSON1 is a fanatic for science and history. @PERSON2 has a preference for religious books that explain the theology behind some of the things the world says and things of his religion. At the end of the row, on top of the shelf sits a book on the topic of evolution. @PERSON1 belives this theory and sees the book as interesting. @PERSON2 looks at the book and thinks to himself, 'That stuff is not true. Why would anyone waste their time reading it.' Does that mean that the book should be taken off the shelf because @PERSON2 will not read it. @PERSON2 should just walk away from it. If he chooses not to, that is up to @PERSON2. Leave that choice to @PERSON2.     Up at the desk there are the librarians.They have their views and opinions and are entitled to them as well. But the books, music, movies, and magazines that are displayed  for checking out should not be chosen because he or she likes them or opposes them, but because someone might be looking for the information in that material. If the choice is left to them that material might not be available to the reader that needs it.     Censorship is a terrible thing for libraries. It takes material away from people that can be useful. Censorship, along with many other things is relative. @CAPS1 one person @MONTH1 deem inappropriate could be viewed as totally fine with another person. Based on moral values, character, and opinions developed with progression of life, people have made judgements on @CAPS1 is appropriate or unacceptable. That choice to look at that magazine, read that book, or listen to that song should be left up to them, not made for them.",5,4
3105,"Censorship in libraries should not be a big deal. There are materials in libraries that are found to be offensive to some people. To solve the problem, everything should not be censored. Why can't those that find it offensive just steer clear of it? I believe it should be a persons choice to read something or not and if they find it offensive, they should simply put it down.     The book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2' has offended many people. I have read it and was not offended. I found it very interesting and educational. Many people think the book should be censored. But if it is censored, the story would completely change and it would not be the same. I would have learned nothing instead of learning how people lived in @LOCATION1's history.      If all the books and magazines that were offensive to one person were taken off the shelves, and all the books offensive to another taken away, what would be left? Little kids books about kittens? Well that's just lovely.     I am very much against censorship. I believe that if a material is offensive to you, then you shouldn't read it or listen to it. But don't ruin it for the rest of us",3,3
4069,"Have you ever went to a library and found that some books arn't really the best choice for younger kids to be reading? Well I am about to write a persuasive essay explaining what I think is best for younger children to be reading.          I have went to multiple libraries and found that some books, magazines, and movies are way to extreme for kids to be reading/watching. I personaly think that children who arn't above @CAPS5 years old shouldn't be exposed of rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @NUM1 books, movies, or magazines. Children shouldn't have to know what adult movies, books, or magazines should look like at the age @NUM2. What I think kids should watch or read are @CAPS2 movies and books.           Some of you are probly like 'but it's not like there going to know what it means.' @CAPS4 if children don't know what something means then that deffinantly won't stop them from saying it. Children learn by hands on or watching other things. They will eventually ask what does this mean or mommy what does this word mean. No parent is ready to tell there child at the age of three what a four letter word means. If you are one of the few parents that don't know how to explain things to your child then thats when you can bring out the older books/movies. But don't let them read it on there own. Usually kids will start asking about more adult things when the hit the age @CAPS5 and up. Thats when you as a parents can start letting them read and watch older movies and books.          Tweleve years old is still a pretty young age for a kid to be reading and watching older movies on there own. Thats when you as a parent can sit down next to them and explain what is going on. As a kid we look up to our parents. We learn from seeing what you guys do. That is the exact same thing as reading and watching movies that are way to extreme for us at the age of ten. At the age of sixteen then usually kids are fine on there own they know what to expect. They know what is happening and they know how to handel it.           In conclusion I think that rated @CAPS1 books, magazines and movies should be kept above ages one-@CAPS5. I think that kids will be better off learning about things that they need to know by the time middle school starts. Then once they hit highschool they will already know about what becoming an adult is all about",4,3
3414,"Certain materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines, do not need to be removed from the shelves in libraries if they are found offensive.  There are multiple reasons to back up this statement, including an accurate quote from author Katherine Paterson.     People build their character through their reactions of how people treat them.  For example, in life sombody @MONTH1 offend another person, but that does not mean the offender is going to dissapear after doing so.  How does this relate to libraries you might ask?  Books and movies do not need to be taken off of shelves in libraries if they are found offensive because there are a lot of things in the real world that are offensive.       It is your choice in what you want to read, listen to, or watch.  Just because you @MONTH1 have the option of checking out something you do not think is appropriate or is offensive, does not mean you have to check it out.  Some people @MONTH1 enjoy reading or watching things that are offensive.     You @MONTH1 be wanting to argue, 'But I don't want my children being exposed to such offensive materials.'  That is why most public libraries are split into children and adult sections.  If you happen to come across an offensive book in the childrens section, then do not let your child check that out.  It is as simple as that.  Trying to take the book off the shelf or complaining about it would only take up more time.       The quote, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us', by Katherine Paterson, is a perfect example to conclude the reasons why books should not be taken off the shelf.  She is saying that if one person is allowed to remove a book, then anybody else would be able to have that ablitiy as well.  Therefore, a book that @MONTH1 not offend you at all could be taken off the shelf because somebody else does not approve of it.  Eventually, there would be no books left.       In conclusion, if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offend you, simply do not check them out.  You do not need to get rid of them because somebody else @MONTH1 want to check them out",4,4
4146,"These days there are many kinds of merdia in the liberaries beside books. There are musics, movies, magazines and many more. There are all kind of things and resources that you can find from liberaries. Do you think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive? What do you think? I think it shouldn't remove. Even it is stuff that you don't want children to know, they will know someday. Once we remove it from the shelves then more things, the informations are going to removed. After all, nothings is going to be leaft.     There are a lot of imfornation in this world. Growing children learn all kind of stuff from parents, book and from other medias. Parent want to let their children to learn much as possible. However there are sutten things that parent doesn't want the children to learn. You need to think this way. That children will grow up and become adult, then they will know any way. Why would you move from the shelves, if they are going to know about it some how? What is a point about it? Doesn't removing from the shelves helps children to not know about it? I don't think there is a point to do that.     Katherine Paterson, the Author, said 'All of us can think of a books that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us'. I agree with Katherine. Once, the books or other mediea get removed because of some reason, other things are going to removed because of other reasons. I don't think it should be remove, like Katherine said there are nothing gonna leaft for the children. If nothing gonna leaft for the children what is main point of having libaries?     I believe the certain materials, such as books, music, magazines and many more, should be removed from the shelves it they are found offensive, because children will know and need to know to be adualt. Also there is nothing gonna leaft for the children in the libareries",3,3
3002,"I think almost every movie might offend someone in some way, So if your wanting to take every movie off the shelf then go ahead. Everyone has different taste in movies, music, books, etc. If the music offends you, don't listen to @CAPS2. If a book does, don't read @CAPS2. Its as simple as that. So I don't think they should remove the books, music, movies, etc. That could offend someone, and here are my reason why;          If you were to remove all the things that might interest the people now a-day, then you wouldn't have anything that entertains the kids instead of them going out and getting in trouble, I believe every person has the right to read, watch, or listen to whatever @CAPS2 is they want to listen to. Also If they find @CAPS2 offensive then they just shouldn't listen that song, watch that movie, or even read the book or magazines. Everyones offended in different ways from another, So we can't help @CAPS2 if @CAPS3 little book, song, etc., offends a person.          I also think if you give a kid the chance to read @CAPS2, and he sees how offensive @CAPS2 might be, @CAPS2 might keep him/her from doing some of the things he might do if he didn't read the book, Also if he watches what movies he wants, he will learn that, @CAPS1 every body is good people. Children read in a wide variety, some read there dr.suess books and other could be reading @PERSON1 '@CAPS2'. Depending on the children they should be able to choose what they read, listen to or watch. The only flaw I find about Children down side to some magazines is the fact almost every magazine has atleast @CAPS3 half naked women, or man in @CAPS2. Children in there @ORGANIZATION1 years through about first year of @ORGANIZATION2 should @CAPS1 have to see that.          My @CAPS4 reason is, people have many different tastes in the materials, so I believe they can read what they want as long as @CAPS2 does @CAPS1 offend them. What there reading should @CAPS1 have any effect on others unless they are reading @CAPS2 also. There are so many people that get offended by the littlest things, but they don't see that its life they will get offended more than a hand full of times in there life.           In conflusion I think that people should be able to read what they want even the books people find offensive. The offensive things Should @CAPS1 be taken off the shelves. I also feel that if children get to read some things that could be offensive then they will understand the fact that life isn't easy and you will end up being offended. Also that @CAPS1 everyone is good people, and things happen that people don't like but its life. Finally I think people should @CAPS1 have to give up reading, listening to, watching or looking at things that @MONTH1 be interesting to them",3,3
3199,"Do we have the right to take books? Author Katherine Paterson proves a point by saying 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if everyone is able to just remove books from the shelf because they have something agaist it then we would hardly have any books at our libraries.        Everyone has their own opinions. There are so many things that effect our opinions. Our beliefs, life styles, way of thinking, culture, and the list goes on. I'm sure I could think of certain books, movies, music, and magazines that I dont like and could just do without. Does that mean I want to totally rid the world of those certain materials? It sure wouldnt bother me but that would be extreamly selfish. Even if something is totally innopropriate and offensive it is still information. Maybe it shouldnt go in the little kids section of a library or store but i dont think it should be removed completely. Music especially. There are wide ranges of music from rap, rock, oldies, screamo, classical, country, alternative and the list goes on. I dispise country; I go for the alternative and classical music. I know a lot of people who love it though. All the old people i know hate all the rap. Most of it is pretty offensive but thats just how things are.         So no, I dont think anyone should have the right to remove anything from anywhere just because they personally find it offensive. We cant hide from the world. I think people should be open to new things and understand that not everyone likes the same things. If we remove thing materials we dont care for, others will remove the ones you like and so on. So then were left with nothing. Just like freedom of speech we should have the freedom to read, listen to, and watch what we enjoy",4,4
4658,"Hello @ORGANIZATION1, I am writing to talk about censorship in libraries. In libraries they have tons of materials that have language and images that are offensive. i have a broad view on this subject. My view is just that if the censor stuff in a library, the should censor tv.     I have deaf parents, so we always have the captions on in our house. Everyday I see bad language thats inot censored. I also have seen images that are not censored. The youth of this time mostly watch tv than use the library. So why not censor tv. I see things on tv that i wont see in a library.     In my conclusion i would like to say i dont believe that libraries should censor their materials because the studdent will still find out. There are plenty of other places that are worse. Like crimes scenes, cime scens have blood and gore and a library would just have language. These are my views ancd yours could be differnt.",3,3
4738,"Dear reader,     Do you believe that certain book, magazines, movie, and music should be removed from the shelves of libaries if they are found offensive?  A lot of people in the world today are having this same question.  Some parents think they should be removed, but others argue they should stay.  I'm going to tell you what i think.      As a citzen,  I know some parents are arguing that certain magazines and books should be removed from the libary if they are found offensive.  Well if they do that then there wouldn't be anything on the shelves in the libary would be shut down.  I mean i see where some of the parents are coming from some of these things are offensive and not apporaite for children, but if you dont want your children to see it them keep them away from that section of the libary or don't bring them, you go get the book or magazine they want and then bring it back home for them.       In the world today everything is offensive to someone in the world i mean everyone has there own thoughts on what they think is offensive and what they don't think is offensive. So eventually if you were to take everything offensive out of the libary it would be emptied out.  I want you all to read this quote and really think about what the author is saying ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf.  But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf -that work i abhor- then you have the exact same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (@PERSON1).  I don't know about you, but this really sums it all up for me.     The truth is you cant always do what you want, you just have to live with the way it is and try to make it better for yourself and your family.  If you read this article and really listen and take into considertion what im saying i think you 'll find that it would be a lot easier for you to just act like the offensive books and magzines aren't there because if you try to get them taken out you wont even be able to go to the libary anymore.                                             sincerly the one and only,                                                                     @PERSON2",3,3
3176,"Hello, my name is @CAPS1 and I think that books, newspapers, and magazines being censored should be done but shouldn't. When I say that I mean that some books dealing with adventure or romance might have parts that need to be censored, but thats how the author made the book. It was meant to catch your attention right off the first sentence of the story.      I believe that sometimes magazines need to be censored because they are promoting bad habits for people all across the @LOCATION1 and other people around the world. Magazines in my opinion should be censored. Now some make it to where there less inaproperate which is somewhat a good thing, but others pretty much just let it slide and figure it will raise the sales by how ever much percent they want it to be considering what they put in the magazine.      I feel that books should stay on the shelf however. Some people feel that the 'censored' parts of the story are really what catches there attention. I myself have never had an expirence in this field because im not one to be a strong reader, but knowing how other people are, I would suggest that we censor some things, but not all.     People write books all the time dealing with something that has happened in their lifetime or something from their imagination. So we can't really help what people think about and what some people write down to be published in a book. For some readers, it is a very interesting story or passage being read from the back cover of the book, while others just want the book gone from there neighborhood library or out of their house. It all really depends on the reader.      If I could, there would be things I would censor, but not in books. It was their idea to put it in the story but some things need to be left unsaid. Some readers appriciate it, while others do not. It is really their choice to read the book and if its not appealing to them they can simply put it back on the shelf and find another close to it. I just feel that some magazines should be censored. Constantly, you see swimsuit models and 'sexual appeal' in magazines everyday when you enter the grocery store or library. I just do not think it is right for little kids to see that when there looking for a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 book or a book about their favorite animal.      Another reason to censor magazines would be because of some religious views on what people see when they look at the magazine. People everyday become @CAPS4 and being right with @CAPS5, so people will take offense to some of the disturbing images in magazines. I myself as a @CAPS6 take offense to some of these magazines, promoting being perfect and having the life sucked out of you as you read each passage.      As I have said, I am to the understanding of the books having what they have in them, because of the authors imagination, but some magazines just need to be thrown off the shelf",4,4
3060,"Certain materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive for three reason. The first reason being  what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is.     The first reason is that what maybe offensive to you @MONTH1 not be to someone else. In this society we live in we shouldn't go base on ones option because everybody has a right to freedom of speech. History show that many different people found different thing to be offensive because some people think that book that haves gays shouldn't be in books, but many feel otherwise.That a good example on how people have different opition.     The next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The libraries being a place to study and learn should have a bus load different things even if some take offensive to it. Infact some books teach us that we shouldn't get offfensive because that what one person feels and at long as your got someone who love you it doesn't matter.     The last reason being if we all just removed thing we don't like the world wouldn't be the way it is. Books are a way for someone to give there own point of veiw if you dislike it don't take offensive to it and try to removed it from the shelves. The @LOCATION1 has a government where they take everybodys opition. A prime example of this is the state funding schools which is a big issue we shouldn't just removed the school because someone doesn't like it.     In conclusion certain materials shouldn't be removed from shelves if they're found offensive for three reasons. The first reason being if you found something offensive it @MONTH1 not be to someone else. Next reason being that the thing being call offensive can help teach other about many different things. The last reason being if we all just removed thing we dislike the world wouldn't be the way it is.",4,4
4623,"In my life time I have been to many libraries. I also seen many diffrent catagories of books suck as comedy, fiction, non-fiction, drama, and etc. As we all know there are many topics out thier that is not suitable for minors or suitable for many other ages.     Movies in this time and age reveal to much for you eyes. For example in cartoons their are sexual content such as kissing .Some parents don't want their child expose to the kind of activity yet. Movies somtimes put false beliefs in peoples mind about the way things are, going to be,or the why you sould see it.Their are also some good movies place in libraries such ass docomentries, history , biography, and etc. Thats gives you good insite on how things was and hoe things are now.     Another topic is magazines. Its strange things going on in the world that @CAPS1 sould be aware of the why we put them in magazines but children have easy access to them in libraries. Picture that magzines have are images that sould be places in some magazines. As there are bad things there are also good that come from magazine. Magazines are in some ways just as useful as books. They carry very helpful information.     Music is aslo a big topic thats placed in libraries. Some of the lauguage thats is place on  cd tracks are good BUT  theirs alot of bad material that on them also. So many people out the known as @CAPS2 say some very harsh and profaine words that many and children sould just not want to hear. Like I said before as their is bad thier is much good. We have gospel , jazz, @CAPS3&@CAPS4, and etc that many people enjoy listing to.     In conclusion thier are many things good that belongs in libraries but also many bad. Libraries in my opinion sould take more caution on what people have access to. Very easy a young child (that can read) can pick up a adult book go sit in a corner read and be expose to most things parents are expose to. So in my opinion yes certin things should be removed from the shelves if the are found offensive.",4,4
4279,"Keep it on the shelvesThe reason for libraries is so that people can read what they want to read. If I owned a library I would have everything on the shelves because there are alot of people and not everyone likes the same thing. Truthfully I wouldn't care because it isnt just about a handful of people it is about everyones feelings. If people started taking certain things out of there book stores libraries it would eventually get out of hand. The reason it would get out of hand is because a certain topic like slavery if someone wanted to learn about it or enjoyed reading topics like that it wouldnt be fair because @CAPS1 @CAPS2 people might find it offensive to put stuff out there for the public like that.     Everyone has their own opinion but why express your own opinion if the subject you want to express it under isn't harming anyone physically or emotionally. If everyones opinion was heard and taken into consideration tghe world as we know it would be boring and outragous. People like action and adventures, others like laid back kind of stuff. Why take things from people that they have had for a very long time if its just going to start a conflict and change the way people live everyday life. Maybe it could turn out in a good way but really what are the chances of that @NUM1 billion to a thousand.                           Things that are offensive to some people are very interesting to others so keep everything on the shelves. If only certain people are going to complain about it its not really a big deal. Maybe someday when everyone in the world agrees on @NUM2 reasoning then we could change it but i really dont see that happening anytime soon. The main reason is there is always going to be conflict between @NUM3 or more groups of people. Everyone cant be happy at the same time i say who cares weather something offends someone or not thats their opionion and until alot more people are seeing it and can stay on the shelf for the people that actually enjoy that kind of stuff.",3,3
4226,"Movies is to popcorn as music is to headphones. Right? It is all fun and games until someone's innocence is completely destroyed. The simplest forms of entertainment are being minipulated by today's world. Many of the children in our modern society are quickly becoming conditioned and used to seeing and reacting to media found in the everyday store, shop, or library. The innocence of the youth today is slowly being destroyed by the subliminal messages found in music, magazines, and movies. The messages are all the same in each type of media: sex, drugs, and violence.      The world of music has evolved so much over the past decades of time. We go from jazz, disco, funk, rock, hard rock, to hip- hop/rap. All of these types belonging to a certain decade. But in our era, the music industry is exploding with rap and hip- hop music. This type of music is triggered towards the three ideas of sex, drugs, and violence. Almost every song that is heard today on the radio or on your iPod will most likely have something to do with one of those three. The sense of being so naive and so innocent is broken after listening to these songs everytime the radio is on. The youth does not need to be listening to this whatsoever and therefore, parents should be more aware about what their children are listening to and should think more about the effects that the media has on them.     Recently, more and more people are turning to articles and segments of works to read instead of the 'good old fashioned' novels. The novels that were written before our era are clean and nonexplicit. But today, literature has gone down a new course. More and more, @ORGANIZATION1 companies are becoming less tradional and more upfront about topics that are sexual, violent, or drug related. For example, in @ORGANIZATION1, you will see articles strictly pretaining to sex-like actions. Possibly on the other side of the page, you will see an ad for @CAPS1 cigarettes. Soon enough, kids are going to think that everything they are seeing and looking at will be okay and soon act upon it. The libraries that are offering these magazines for rental should restrict children from reading them due to the lack of modesty and morals found in these magazines.      There has always been a sense of subliminal messaging throughout the development and evolution in the cinematic world of movies. Movies are a timeless object of entertainment. But recently, the subtle or blunt 'hints' of sex, drugs, and violence is portayed in almost all movies offered in the box office today. There have been those action packed movies where there is all the fighting and the blood and the punching. Then there are the sappy movies where all it seems the main characters do is have emotional fights that are soon resolved by a session of steamy sexual actions. These types of movies are offered in libraries nationwide and are easily accessible to children. The youth of our country do not need to be seeing all of these actions and hearing these messages. In no way, shape, or form is this morally correct.      All in all, library censorship is very weak. The people who organize and let this kind of media float around for kids to pick up have some moral issues that need to be checked. The more times a child reads, listens, or watches media with subliminal or blunt messages about sex, drugs, and violence, the more they are going to think it is okay to act and do these actions.  All sense of innocence is destroyed and children are not children anymore",4,4
4360,"Censoring any type of media such as books, magazines, movies, or music from a library is not right. A library is huge amount information put common places for people to seek out knowledge.When something is found offensive, you should not hide it a away as though it was never there. If any media is offensive, it should be the person who is looking up the information to choose if he/she wants to use it.When someone for example a child has something offensive, the first thought is to take it away from the library or television.Instead, just explain what it is there looking at and they will eventually understand the reason it is offensive, but how does someone know what is offensive or not?Just because something is found offensive by one or two people does not make it right to just take it away. It should be talked about or discused by groups of people on the subject then decided whether or not it should be taken off the shelves for being offensive.If there is a book or magazine on the shelve and it might be offensive it should a decision made by the people surrounding that type information to take it off the shelve and not to be hidden away.",3,3
4215,"I think that their should be rooms were certain adult books are at. I think that they should have to be of age to get the books in that section.     I feel strongly that libraries should have every differnt kind of book for anyone. Everyone goes to a library so i think it should be an open library and have all different kinds of books. If a kid or a teenager is trying to get an adult book someone of age should have to come their and check the book out for them.      I think that libraries are for everyone in a community and that not everyone reads and looks at good nice books some look at naughty books and they should have the right to go and check out books like that. When you go to a library you should be able to go their and get whatever genre that you want and their be no restrictions.      I think that the only restriction that should be made is the age limit on naughty adult books or novels and if they are very bad then they should be behind the desk and you have to be of age to get it.      My conclusion is, if you are going to look at all kinds of books they should have no restrictions on what you look at. You should be of age for romance novels and darougatory books but for the library they should have tons of books and magazines with no restrictions",4,4
3718,"If I found a book that offendide me i would have to go and take it off the shealf because if I find that a book is offensive i know that others would think the same. I agre some books can be offensive to some and not to others and its really not fare for thows who think that way.     One reason that i would take it for that shelf would be to keep youn childern form reading it. Parents dont really want there childern reading about vilence and murdare.      Most of what I would take off the shelf would have to be about people being racist agents another person or people. people killing others and be doing sexaule things. People really shouldent read things like that because it puts things in there heads and somtimes make the think the same way as the writer.     If childern read books about vilence and sexaule actions they could think that its ok to do these things to other people and get in to alot of trouble with the law and there parents. Children really need to be keped way from these kinda of books, tell there older and undersdtande whats right and whats wrong. Some books have alot of cursing in them and alot of childern pick up on words and start using them more and more tell it becomes a habbit.     Evern thow some books are of real people they should still be taken off the shealfs. In some of these books there is alot of vilence and childern should not be exsposed to that kinda of book     Books can sometimes be more bad then good. If everbody had there way and could take a book that offendid them off the shealf whenever they wanted then there would be no books left.",3,3
2993,"Dear Newspaper,     @CAPS1 would you feel if someone wrote a book about @CAPS1 bad the newspapers are, and the tore you down so bad no one wanted to touch another newspaper? Think about it if something is found offensive should it be avalible for thousdands and thousands of other people to read? I believe that certain materials such as books, music,movies,ect. that are found offensive should not be allowed to be removed from a libraries book shelves, let alone even be on the shelves.     Now lets just think about this for a moment.What if a sexist book fell into the hands of an inocent childs hands that could just read enough to get through the book? That child could end up living that kind of life that the book protays. If I were a parentt I know for a fact I would never want my children exposed to harmful reading materials until they know right from wrong, and have a clear judgement on it.     Or from another perspective what if that  one book, about @CAPS1 black people are bad and nasty, fell into the wrong hands for this purpose lets say a drunken, old fashioned man. Who just so happens to think we should continue slavery. That one book could stimulate this white mans thoughts and he could try to put his thoughts into action. Throwing what that book says about black people in a young black womans face. Then continues ,after seeing what that alone has done to her, rapes and beats her. Only to let her live and make her his own whore or slave for aslong as shes living. Can you imagan this world when @CAPS2 only knows @CAPS1 bad this woman is hurting. @CAPS2 is the only one who know @CAPS1 long she will deal with the pain.Before she stops fighting for her life.     Just think all that I have told you about, gave you examples of all started with that one single book.The offensive book towards sexists and towards black people. these are all reasons for those book to be ban from libraries or at least glued to the shelves.",3,3
3198,"If the library is in a highschool then we are all old enough that we have already seen or heard anything and everything offensive. In case we haven't though you can't shield your kids from offensive material. This @CAPS1 hurts them in the long run. Such as when your boss gets to work and you or someone around you mess up a important assignment or task he @MONTH1 use terms such as the '@CAPS2' word or other vulgar terms to describe how mad he is. If you were to just hear those for the first time being yelled at you there is a chance you would have a break down or be ineffective for work.      Now im not saying we should all 'cuss' every day and talk in vulgar tongue. Im just saying that the real world doesnt have a 'clean' version. there is no mom or dad there to stand by and say, 'oh no thats not acceptable speech son'. If you took a survey of daily langauge of teens and young adults almost @PERCENT1 would say they use some form of vulgar langauge or inapporiate terms. We need to have our kids and teens to know its not ok to say those things and they need to know what is acceptable in society and not. but taking from them in the library and then thrusting them in a world with daily inapproite acts in not right",2,2
3784,"In the literary world of today it is never hard to find a topic that will interest you. Science fiction, thriller, romance, how to build a car with household materials and many more topics all await you at your nearest bookstore or library. With this vast array of topics it isn't that surprising that you will find some authors that have decided to go against the norms of society and write a book that is controversial in the ideas that it presents. These books will often get put on a 'burn list' or censorship list and will be taken off the shelves of the local libraries in order to protect the patrons of those institutions from those books' ideas. Many have argued that this is a way of keeping the society pure, but this censorship of literary works is probably one of the biggest mistakes a civilization can make.     Removing books from the shelves off a library is a form of censorship, which is a clear violation of the @CAPS1. In the @LOCATION1, everyone has certain unalienable rights. These were written out in our @CAPS1 as the first ten admendments to the @CAPS1. One of those rights is the freedom of speech, or the right to voice your opinion. By remving a book from the shelf of a library, you are silencing the author of that book and thus taking away that author's freedom of speech. This clearly violates the @CAPS1 and thus is unconstitutional and illegal in the @LOCATION1. By violating the @CAPS1 openly, this opens the door for other areas to be violated in the @CAPS1. The president is now a dictator, we are now a communist country, and many other actions are allowed, leaving the @CAPS1 as a scrap of paper with no meaning. Without the @CAPS1, the @LOCATION1 is just like any other country and has no direction. This leads to a downward spiral of our society.     The silencing of the voices of authors also stops new ideas from coming in to a society. Every year thousands of new books are introduced to the @CAPS8 public. Many of these have novel ideas that help shape our society for the future. If you take these books off the shelves, and out of the publics hands, you effectivly stop all change from new ideas in a society. Nothing would ever get better, and the society would stay at the same level that they were when the censorship began.     Censorship can also lead to the downfall of a society. In the novel '@CAPS9 @NUM1' by @PERSON1, the censorship of books has gone so far that all the great literary works of the world are banned. Anyone who is caught reading a book that 'makes the think' locked up or killed. The main characters job as a fireman is not to put out fires, but to set books on fire that encourage people to think. The censorship of that society had gone so far that no one did anything, they just sat at home and watched the television all day. Many people will argue that pornography is something that should be censored out of society, but the problem is once you start censoring, where do you stop? Censoring out pornography would lead to romance novels being censored, which would lead to magic books being censored, and so on until you are censoring out @CAPS10 @CAPS11 or the @CAPS12. By censoring out the books and movies that make people think, you quickly lose all intrest in higher learning. That is why censorsip can quickly lead to the collapse of a society.     Although censorship @MONTH1 seem like a good idea, it is really one of the largest mistakes a society can make. It can lead to the silencing of all the voices of change in a society causing society to grind to halt and stay right were it is. Not only is it determental to a society but it is also is clearly unconstitutional if you look at the @CAPS1 of the @ORGANIZATION1. So let us hope that all though we @MONTH1 play with the idea of censorship, that we never go down that winding road to no where",5,5
4062,"@PERSON1 @NUM1 @DATE2, @DATE1                                   @CAPS1 @CAPS2           You should be able to read any book, listen to any music and watch any movie you want right? Well in some libraries that isn't always the case. Some people find books, music and movies offensive and not suitable for public libraries.     In a public library I think that all books should be there to check out! The books might contain material that is more adult, but thats okay. For the books that are more inappropraite the library needs to offer an adult section. Just for the books that contain more adult material and are not suitable for younger readers. The person checking the book out should make the final decision if they think the book they have selected is right for them.      Music in libraries should not be censorshiped. The lyrics might be inappropraite, but most teenagers listen to that type of music. For younger children they should not be able to check out a @CAPS3 that is more adult. In @CAPS1 opinion, for the music that is more adult you should be at least thirteen years old. Children under thirteen years of age should not have the option to check out that music. Some parents don't know what their child has checked out from the library. The child should have parent concent to check out any music if under the age requirement.      I think that some movies should defenitely be removed if they are found offensive. Some movies have scenes that are horrible and that should be in the adult section. In a library you aren't expecting to find a movie that contains very adult material. At a movie rental store you would expect to find movies that are adult, but not in a public library. Movies for kids to check out should be educational, fun and most importantly, appropriate!      Katherine Paterson says, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf' that is exactly right. I would not want @CAPS1 little cousin reading books with racial comments and just plain out inappropraite content for a child that age. Even if the child doesn't understand what all of the content means, they will ask questions that the parent is most likely not ready to answer. As children,they might get the wrong idea in their head and say things that are not right.      In public libraries books should not be censored movies should be censored and music should not. It all comes down to what do you allow your children to read, watch and listen? Its a debate that has gone through several libraries over the content of the material. Now that you know @CAPS1 opinion on censorshiped, maybe others will consider this an important topic, too",4,4
3361,"Some people @MONTH1 think that certain book, movies, magazines, or music should be removed from libraries because they @MONTH1 be found offensive. I believe that libraries should not rid their shelves of 'offensive' material.      What really makes something offensive? If someone were to tell me that it looked as if I've lost weight, I would find that offensive. The person wouldn't have meant it that way, though. Although I would have found it slighly rude, another person @MONTH1 have found it to be a nice compliment. With this logic, can one really conclude that anything is truely offensive? By saying something is offensive, you're stating your own opinion. Even if they aren't the same as everyone else's, everyone is intitled to their own opinions; equality is something most people find very important. Because of this, one person's definiton of offensive shouldn't be held higher than another's. If we rid libraries of 'offensive' material, that is exactly what you would be doing; you'd be making one person's definition of offensive superior to another person's.      I also believe libraries should not get rid of 'offensive' material because by doing so, they would probably be getting rid of a lot of interesting material. Let's use my religious beliefs for an example. I am @CAPS1 @CAPS2. Basically, I do not believe in '@CAPS3'. If someone were to write a book about my religion, I would find it interesting. Some @CAPS4 @MONTH1 find it to be offensive, though. So if a library got rid of that book because someone found it offensive, I wouldn't want to go there as often. When I go to a library, I want to find a book that I'd enjoy reading. If all the material that is found offensive was taken out of the library, would there really be anything left? If so, I doubt many people would find it interesting.      I also believe this because by taking a book off the shelf because you find it offensive, wouldn't you be offending the author? As I said before, everyone is intitled to their own opinions. Because of this, libraries should allow authors to speak their minds. By taking their books off the shelves, you'd be offending them. They took their time and effort to think about and write that book, and for you to offend them by taking it off the shelf, you'd be controdicting the entire purpose of removing it from the shelf.      In conclusion, I believe that nothing can truely be defined as offensive. Also, people should be able to speak their minds. Therefore, libraries should not attempt to rid there shelves of 'offensive' material",4,4
3559,"Well today i am going to talk to you about censorship in books, Music, Movies, an Magazines  in your libraries, because some of them can be pretty grafic on some of the things they talk about or do in a story. But yes some of them can be more grafic than others, but that doesnt mean you have to take them off the self. Ya not everyone is into a sexual book but there are some people out there that like to read about that stuff. But some people like to read about murders an gangs selling drugs and thats fine. Its like this everyone has their own taste on what they like. it can be a novel, @ORGANIZATION1. Sports, @CAPS1,  just a true story that has happen to someone, an etc. thats just the part of the world. how would it be if everyone liked the same things. pretty boring right yeah deffentally.  So therefore i dont think books should be takin off the shelfs. it could be the next best story for somebody. you never know.     Now with music yes your so called rap today is music that your kids should not listen to. All they talks about is sex, drugs, achole, an etc. But that desnt give you the right to take them off the shelf thats what some people like to listen too. but there is some music out there that dont just talk about that. there is the oldies, country, jazz, hip hop, an etc. but for the most part all music is good its just some of them are better than others, lets take country for instents ya it talks about some sex, an some achole but thats not the whole song they manly talk about country boys an the things they do or have happened to them over time, an they are pretty much right. So all music is good, but without music i dont think the world would be a very nice place. people listen to music all the time. when working out, at work, driving, or just siting at home. So there are some good music an bad muic you make the call.     But with movies there are some movies made just for that reason its all call intertainment for adults. which yes is kinda pointless, but its there an prolly wont ever leave. there are movies made for sex, drugs, an achole. thats just the part of life, everything is not perfect. So in that matter you gota tell your children about this stuff in stop them from watching it at a younge age. because i think it is taking a big role in teen pregnecy, beacuse it they see it an hey it looks fun we shoud try it, and sexual content is so easy to get. its all over the web an etc. its like drugs they are so easy to get. there are meth labs all over for meth. an there is weed all arund. you just gota tell your kids what they can watch an cant. Disney, @ORGANIZATION2, an @CAPS2. are all great shows for kids. so parents be the boss about that stuff.     Now we get to Magazines. there are millions of magazines all aound the world, they are one thing that will never leave this world. they carry news, intertainment, comics, or tips on how to do somethng. thats what is going to be in this world till the world ends. But yes take with caution there are some magazines out there that your children should never look at till adults. but that doesent make them bad people injoy looking at them kinda magazines thats just what people like. its not like your going to stop your son from looking at a @CAPS3. or your daughter from looking at porn. its all apart of life. but you can stop it from happening at a younge age. you just gota get it clear to your child to not look at this stuff till your older. but you cant stop everything. But all i am trying to say is yes there is some bad things out there an their is alot of good things to. but that doesnt give you the right to remove them",3,4
3843,"When you are taking your little kid to the library because they want a book you think 'hmmm, there isn't anything bad at the library its all education books.' @CAPS1 would you feel if your child wanted to check out a movie there? You would be ok with it because no one thinks there are bad images or movies at the library.     A little girl could be with her mom at the library in the adualt section and they could see some things you would not want them to see. The romance books usually have girls on there half clothed and the guys in basically nothing. A child could easily see that and not know what it ment but they would have theat image in there head for a very long time.Some of the kids could go up to the movies section and pull out a scary movie that shows blood and guns.      Its not just the kids seeing the stuff its everyone. A teen could easily get a book and not be paying attention and see stuff about the other gender. A couple could go in the library trying to find a good healthy funny movie, but could find a movie that would make them uncomfortable. An older person could try to find some music from back in their time but when they get it, all of it is about drugs, sex, or even acohole.     The magazines always have girls half clothed, even in seventeen magazine. The car magazines of girls modeling infront of the cars to make them look better or irristable. You can get a baby magazine and it shows a mom breast feeding. You could have jsut wanted to look at if because of the babies you or your child do not want to see a mom breast feeding.     The library is a very resourcful place and you can get very good information about things there. They have some bad parts about them too. I think they music that talks about personal things and bad things should be in its own little place. Same with the magazines, movies and books they should all be in a room together away from all the rest of the items in the library. They should have an age limit you have to be to be able to go in that room. They should tell you what type of stuff is in there before you go in.     I'm not saying the library is a bad place for kids or teens or anyone. I just think that certain books, music, and magazines should be kept in a different place instead of out in the open where everyone can see them.",3,3
4466,"I think that only if there is real offensive stuff then it should be censored.  It is wrong to make fun of or joke about people. Mocking a dissability like there have been  movies made doing. Well actually, there is a movie I've seen before called The @CAPS1 and its a guy that made fun of a special olympic team, then lied about having a dissability to get money for racing and beating the team in races when he was totally fine.That would be something that I myself would want to take off shelves because there is no reason to mock a dissability.  I wouldn't know who decides what goes on shelves and what does not so maybe depending on what the offensive information is tells them something shouldnt be brought out",2,2
3836,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 many people believe that certain books should be banned from schools, just the opposite is true as students can learn valuable life lessons from these books, get a deeper understanding of the past, and comprehend the true meaning of an author's unique style.     Over the years many well-written books have been on a 'censored list', meaning that they are at a risk of being removed from the library.  'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1', '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2', and '@CAPS3 to @ORGANIZATION3' are all examples of books that have been marked down as being offensive.  These books are all written in a style of their own and can bring a different lesson to every reader.  While one reader @MONTH1 love the story and wear out the pages, another @MONTH1 get halfway through and never finish it.  However, the belief that there is freedom of choice in reading is correct.     'The @CAPS2 of @ORGANIZATION1' by @PERSON1 is a classic example of a censored book.  Throughout the book there is foul language used that is considered offensive to some.  However, at the period of time the book was written, these words were not considered to be wrong.  Books like this should be saved for older generations to read; however, we also have to realize that if a parent allows their children to read that book at a young age, there is nothing that can be done about it.  None-the-less, removing the book from the library is not the correct response.     Ever heard the saying 'learn from past mistakes'?  Books are a fantastic way to learn about the past in a fun and enjoyable way.  They are a tool of knowledge.  Removing a book from a library is like removing hundreds of pages of knowledge.  Every story has a unique style, which @MONTH1 appeal to some and not to others.  Many books give readers a deeper understanding of what the time period was like when the book was written.     '@ORGANIZATION2' has been a known censored book from the beginning due to its somewhat dark and gloomy aspects at certain points throughout the story.  How many kids do we see at school carrying around one of the '@ORGANIZATION2 @ORGANIZATION2' books?  They often state that it is their favorite book of all time.  If the book were to be removed from the library, it would cause many students to never have the opportunity to read a fantastically written book, which has a unique style about it.     Throughout our twelve years of school, students are taught to think for themselves and make their own decisions.  How are we encouraging this if we are removing materials from their grasp?  If we cannot let students make such a simple decision as to whether or not to read a book, we are teaching poor life lessons.",4,4
3577,"Many people have many different thoughts and beliefs. Some people @MONTH1 believe that a movie or song needs to be removed, but others @MONTH1 disagree, and nobody wants the things they enjoy to be taken away.     If there was a book on a shelf in a bookstore that you didn't agree with and thought should be removed, and you removed it, then you are taking away from someone who @MONTH1 enjoy that book. If everyone removed things from life that they didn't enjoy, then there would be very little to enjoy.    For example, I personally love horror movies. I love the thrill you get from a horror movie and how they can make you jump even though it's just a movie screen. I'm sure there are people in this world who think horror movies are wrong. If those people were allowed to just remove them forever, I, and many other people, would be sadly dissapointed. I also love video games. Video games are a huge part of my life, and I know for a fact that there are people who highly disagree with some of the content of them. If people could take video games away because they didn't agree with them, i would be crushed.     I am also aware that people @MONTH1 just be worried about their children watching movies, listening to songs, or reading books that are not appropriate for them. I understand that the parents want their children to be supervised, but removing the books, movies and songs is not exactly the answer. Movies and books can easily be censored. Many movies and songs have language filters and some movie programs now have parental options that allow the parents to decide what movies they want to allow their children to watch. Parents can also supervise their children when they download music onto an ipod or phone, and depending on where they are bought, books and magazine's @MONTH1 require parental consent. Video games also require parental consent depending on the rating of the game.      We can't just go around removing everything we dont like, because it is not fair to those who @MONTH1 like it. We live in a world with many different ideas, thoughts and beliefs, and we all need equal right to share them",4,4
4625,"Dear @PERSON1 news paper editor.     Pulling a book, cd, dvd/vcr tape, magazine, etc.,because of whether or not they are offensive or obscene is a panzy move from the people who think the world must be perfect when in reality it is so far from perfect that it is disgusting,and yet the sad truth is the fact that only a small percentage of people on the face of the earth have come to accept this truth. If I have not conviced you other wise please keep reading.     I believe that if the world can not handle what is on the shelf at the public library they should just leave it alone, and stay in there comfort zone of reading seletions. If they are offended they can go to read some where else.       I understand that people might have been there first. If that is the case well then nicely ask the person/persons offending you to move some where else.     The world is not a perfect place by no means. The world does have it's positives for instance the @CAPS1 nations, and north atlantic treaty organization (@CAPS2.A.T.O.), but for some reason the world acts as if they are going to die if there is not perfection all around them. That means that they decided to strip the libraries all over the world of the offensive and obscenties in all the books so that way boredom and perfection could slowly but surely set into the worlds minds to be okay. Well I refuse to let it set into my mind, and I hope you choose the same for yourself.                    Your's @CAPS3                               @CAPS4",3,3
3440,"Should taking books, music, and movies off shelves of libraries even be questioned? Aa stated in our constitutuion, people have the freedom to information. People have had this luxury every since the beginning of this marvelous country. Also @CAPS1 have the choice to either pick up a type of book or not too. So to answer my question, taking types of books and movies off shelves is completely out of the question,     In the @ORGANIZATION1, it @ORGANIZATION1 that people have the freedom of speech, religion, and many others including freedom to information. Due to this reason places like libraries should have as much information as possible out on there shelves. Even if some of the conduct is inapropriate, it is still serves a way to educate. Which for children, education is largely what their childhood is for. Parents and teachers are always pushing their kids to go out, read and learn new topics other than what is being taught in the classroom or at home. If books were to be taken of the shelves, we @CAPS1 would only be depriving our youth of knowledge in the world. All books or magazines @MONTH1 benificial to some and offensive to others. However for those who would find this beneficial do we want to simply go against our @ORGANIZATION1 and deprive them of that information?     Another topic in the @ORGANIZATION1 is the freedom of choice. Even if bad books or magazines are on the shelve, children have the choice to pick them up. Parents should simply tell there kids to leave those types of materials alone and choose something else. Having books that @MONTH1 seem innapropriate to some, aren't hurting anyone by just sitting on the shelve. However some, @MONTH1 come aross a book like this and find it very interesting and decide to check it out. This action plays no effect on child who is not supossed to be viewing material like that. Finally, it is very simple to avoid this type of information, all one has to do is simply not choose to look at it and walk right by it.     As for myself, I personally as a child was not allowed to view certain types of movies, books, or magazines. For example I was restricted from watching rated @CAPS2 movies or things with innapropriate sexual actions. Since this was the case, I simply avoided those types of movies or magazines that had those types of content. For most of my childhood I did this and it was very simple. However, I don't think it would be fair to remove those types of things from other children. For the reason that it's their choice to do what ever they would like and that it has no affect on me at all. Lastly, I feel like removing certain things from libraries would be very unfair to children who have the privelage to view them.     In conclusion, removing materials,s uch as books, music, and movies is completely absurd. As I said before doing something like this, would be going against our constitutuion. The answer to solving this problem to me is black and white, children should just not pick up those types of materials end  of case",4,4
3827,"A library is a place to rent books, music, movies, etc., that you don't have at your home. Some people go to a library to use the computer for a project, or to check out books, musical materials, movies, etc. @CAPS1 isn't a bad thing if the library has materials that are offensive to some people. If people don't want to see material that will offend them then they shouldn't go to the are in the library that contains the offensive materials.      In my own personal opinion, @CAPS1 doesn't really apply to me if there is offensive material in the library. If there is going to be offensive material in a library then you should be a certain age to rent @CAPS1 or read @CAPS1. Not just anyone should be able to walk into the library and check out these offensive materials. If someone that is under this age tries to check out this material, then they shouldn't be aloud to have them.     Another opinion of mine on this subject, is if these kinds of material offend someone then they could not go to that area of the library. Instead the person can go around this section of the library or they could not pay attention to the materials. The library could make a certain part of the library made just for these kinds of material, so that people nor children have to see them.      Also, if a child wants to see these kinds of materials then they could find another way to see them. They don't necessarily have to go to the library to find these kinds of things. If a child wants to do something badly enough then they will find a way to do @CAPS1, or in this case the child will see something that they want to see.        If parents don't like these kinds of materials in the library then they should teach their children not to look at these kinds of materials, if they catch their children looking at materials that are offensive then they should punish their child and let them know that they shouldn't look at those kinds of materials. A library shouldn't have to take off their books, music, magazines, etc., just to satify parents.      If the library took these kinds of materials off of their shelves then they would lose business. So in theory, libraries should not have to take their materials off of their shelves just to satisfy parents. Libraries need money so that they can buy new materials and without customers they have no money which enables them unable to buy new materials. So parents should keep track of what their kids check out at the library. Offensive materials should not be taken out of libraries, these kind of materials should just have rules.",4,4
4132,"Shut down libraries?     Yes, I do, because music, movies, etc. could not only contain unnessisarry attire, they could also contain potty mouth language.  The words could, and can, corupt the minds of youngsters.  All librairies put them there because of the needs of customers.  The things they do to make some cash around here, do you agree with me?     They should create seperate libraries for each type of reader.  Still, they put all of these things in the same building.  They should put up sales for kids' movies not adults, but the librarians say 'books are books'.  I think I'll write my own @CAPS1 sieries, thank you very much.     However, because some have dull enviornments, or lack of customers, some libraries close down.  Make use of that thought I just told you.  I wonder if some books on endangered species of fish.  But some kid's sieries are dieing of because of more popular ones, or being replaced by some family stories.     If a little kid were to listen to some cursing, his/her mind will be warped for life.  What chic-cursing out loud in front of the baby.  How about saying '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 that?..' or '@CAPS4 that ball, you meanie!'?  Maybe THAT will give some education.     However, some older boys and girls are teaching this bad language to the young mind-maybe even before they learn good language.  Those dilenguents don't care about their minds at all.  Your honor, I have my proof right here.  I suggest reeducating those teenage dilenguents to acting more @CAPS1.",3,3
4690,"Cencorship is a very large thing to talk about. Some people think that a book has too much talking about sex in it, while others think that it is sutable for the public. Sometimes people want other people to make the decitions on what they read. People need to decide what they do and don't want to read and see.      Firstly, people think that other people are incable of deciding for them selves what they want to read. They blocked books because they thought that it would show a side of things to children that they did not want them to see. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 books were block because they had witchcraft and they were scared that people were going to start trying to do it. Grapes of @CAPS3 was banded because their was slavery in it. Even though slavery was a big thing they still did not want any of the younger people to have it.      Secondly, some music and movies should be banned. Music has become a way for people to express them selves. Latily they have gotten to the point that drugs and 'hos' are alright to talk about. One song that I just saw was called @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Now if that is not sending a bad message than I don't know was is a good message. Movies are in the same boat as music. They are showing the violence that people only have in their head. @PERSON1 was a movie that off the top of my head was showing a minner that had gone completly blood thursty and was killing any one that went in his cave, just because he could.      Although, somethings we need to see the things that people have in @CAPS8 heads. I know that I am going to be more carful when I am out.      In conclution, @CAPS8 is no real yes or no anser. @CAPS8 is always exceptions to whatever people say. This is why people need to decide what they do and don't watch and read",3,3
3348,"Have you ever found books, movies, music, and magazines that are about drugs, sexuality, and violence?      I think that books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they have anything to do with drugs, sesuality, and violence. There are many reasons why I think that those books, movies, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of libraries. One reason is because little kids can get ahold of the book, the kind of music, the movie, and the kind of magazine that contains drugs, sexuality, and violence then they can learn how to do those kinds of things.     A second reason why I think that they should be removed from the shelves of libraries is because I feel like a library is not a place to have those kinds of books, magazines, that kind of music, or that kind of movies for parents and their kids to read about and to watch, or even to listen to music that contains drugs, sexuality, and violence.     The third reason why I believe that they should be removed form the shelves of libraries is because thoes kinds of materials belong in another building, a building that is far away form children and only certain people can get into the building and look at the books, magazines, watch the movies, and listen to music that contians that kind of stuff.      The last reason why I believe that they should be removed is because from experience, one time I found a book about drugs I looked at it but it was very unappropate for little kids to look at, it had pictures of what drugs look like, what certain durgs can do to the body.     In conclusin I hope who ever is reading this that you realize what these books, moveis, music, and magazines are doing to the people that are reading them, watching them, and listening to them",4,4
4057,"I think that we should have offensive materials on the shelfs in libraries. People have their own ideas and opinions about offensive material like @CAPS1 shouldnt be around in libraries for children to read or we should have offensive material because @CAPS1 might help someone one day. Some times when people think of offensive material they think of bad and not good for people to read or watch because @CAPS1's not treating people right. Then also some offensive material like videos or movie can be very fun and make the movie great to watch. Today im hear to tell that offensive material can help students in high school research for a project, @CAPS1 can also show us how offensive materials were back in the old days, and @CAPS1 can also teach us more about offensive material.      Today in are generation we do alot of studing or projects for school, we do this so we know more about the subject. As a high school student i would research the topic about offensive material. Why would you ask i do this? Because of researching this offensive material you can learn more about @CAPS1. Like where did @CAPS1 come from, why people are offensive, you could probably find out more than what you know and thats a good thing finding out what you dont know. So if we take away the offensive material we would never get to learn more about @CAPS1 or know where @CAPS1 came from. Its good to still have have books that are  offensive material because you get educated not to be offensive.     Going to a library is fun and exciteding because you get to read all these books. Well when you choose a book you can choose the most recent one or the one back from the old days. In are case we have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries. Lets just say here you went to the library today and you wanted to research a paper on offensive material from the old days. Well in the library they will have generations of  books on offensive material. This provides us of offensive material back in the old days. So the library is a good thing to have that because we need to know  about what happend back in the old days.     Everyone one goes to a library to learn more about what they like to do or read a really good book. Well i know alot of people that would love to learn more about offensive material. Offensive material to people is like a good book you can read @CAPS1 and learn more about. Some people think learning to much is a bad thing exspecially when @CAPS1 is on offensive material. Learning to much is not even a discusion because people can learn whatever they want to. If the libraries take away the offensive material @CAPS1 is just like talking a good book from you.      People can think what they want to think about offensive material. Like i said before if libraries take away offensive material book, its like taking away a good book from a reader. People do need to learn about offensive material thats why we still have the books. If we didnt want to know about offensive material why did they publish all the books and videos about @CAPS1. This is why i think we should have offensive material on the shelfs in libraries",3,3
4677,"Censorship in libraries could have negative effects on the library. Parents have different views on books, music, ect. One parent @MONTH1 not have a problem with one book that has a few curse words in it but another parent might think it is not something they want their children to pick up and read then later on start using that kind of language. But if the libraries censor that book and is taken out of the library it would make a big impact on people because, what if somebody really likes that book but since someone complained about it, it is now not allowed in the library. The library would lose people because of books being censored.     Everybody might not agree on different subject and they would want a certain book, music, movie or magazine censored. But if one person complained and the book is no longer there does that mean the libraries are going to be empty for now on. A person who @MONTH1 not have children might say, '@CAPS1 one little joke can hurt.' A joke not suitable for a child under @NUM1 to read, hear, or watch. But a parent might get upset that their child is hearing, reading, or even seeing these things and might band it from the library.     When a student @MONTH1 need to go to the library to go look up their topic they must research for school and can not find any or even good books on that topic because someone who thought the book was offensive has been removed from the library. The student might get frustrated and would not know what to do and would have to get most to all of their research off the @CAPS2. What if their teacher/proffesor said that they needed more then one source and all their information can not just be off the computer they need a book, magazine, or newspaper source also. But since that topic they are researching about has upset someone they are not able to find the imformation they are looking for.      Yes, there are some books, music, movies, magazines, and sometimes newspapers that are not for children under @NUM1 or even pre-teens to teens. That is why the libraries are divided into sections for the age groups. Still how do these section keep our children from reading something unaporite. Parents should know when they come into a library they should look for signs on the walls, if a library does not have signs that tell them what kind of section they are coming into all they have to do is grab a few books of the shelfs and read the inside cover or outside to suggest what kind of books are in the rest of that section. It should not be hard to find these sections because usually the children section has toys and puzzles in them and children theme walls.      Censorship would not only get rid of the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but it would also make our libraries empty. A lot of people have different point of views, his view might be diffrent from her view. From teens to young adults, teachers to children, parents to non-parents. Everyone is different no one person can speak for the whole world. This is why censorship would not work in our libraries.",4,4

3255,"If any book, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be offensive to anybody don't even bother to look at the material.  Even if you might find it interesting, in then end you find out that it is offensive to you then just take it the other direction.  No material of books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the materials because authors, directors, and music writers have made it their creation. Nobody has the same views as everybody else, each person is different in their own way.  Then why is it so bad when they have offended you if it wasn't intentional?     Each individual has their own opinion of each material. It might be offensive to somebody else, but to another person it might not even effect their views about what they've read, seen, or heard. Others @MONTH1 have to realize that even if its written down it is not directed towards the person reading it, if they have tooken it the wrong way. Even if your just making an observation just walk away and do not let it get the best of you. Don't let anybody tell you different of your own opinion.     The cenorship in libraries are not made just for you, they are made for everbody around you. If you do not like a book in the library or even think it is inapropriate then just walk away and put it down. Anything in the library shouldn't be removed, just because you didn't like it doesn't mean that somebody else will find it interesting. If you find any material offensive then maybe you should think in your head of ways to make an argument to prove the authors that they are wrong.  You just have to be strong and take anything that comes your way, and you have to be ready for it.      I go to the library once in a while,and most of the time i'm just looking around for something to read and I find something interesting and I pick it up. Once I start reading it, and if I feel  the type of material is directed towards me and I find it offensive I just leave it along and put it down.  I don't take it the wrong way because I know it isn't a serious type of matter, because it didn't have my name in the book. So, why should I get worked up about it if it isn't about me?  I don't take any type of material that I'm looking at in any negative way because I know that someone else's opinion and not my own.      If anybody takes it the wrong way then they should look at other things about the topic and put your own opinion on the topic. Anybody should know that your own opinion matters than anything else or anybody else. The littlest things shouldn't get to anybody, especially if it doesn't matter. It doesn't change how you feel about the topic. The way you feel about it should not affect the way other people feel see it",3,4
3243,"Have you ever walked into the library hoping to find a good book, and picked up a very volgar and inapropriate article? Were you dissapointed to see what children could easily get a hold of, or did you just place it back onto the shelf just simple thinking it wasn't your style of book? In this essay I would like to discuss both views on these censored books, and why I believe they should be censored.      People all over the world are vastly different. From color, race, size, shape, and personality there is not a single person on the planet who is excatly like the other, so why would they all have the same interest in reading or music? Some @MONTH1 enjoy a romantic novel that makes your heart skip beats while @CAPS1 my prefer the thrill of a horror story. Either way everyone has their own opinion of what makes a great book. The same thing accures in the question, whether or not censored items should be allowed into a public library.      Many @MONTH1 say yes, people have their right to choose what they @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not observe or listen to, 'If you don't like the style in which the item is protrayed then don't pick it up.' @CAPS1 @MONTH1 say no, 'The library is suppose to be a safe haven where they don't have to worry about children seeing and hearing things they shouldn't.' In my personal opinion I believe the parent figure is right, although I also can understand the opposing opinion.      As to the opposing opinion, I can understand why you @MONTH1 think that censored items are ok in libraries. If it is a personal choice of how the author writes the book and still makes a great story, I believe that the book is alright as long as it is not in reach of a child. Many people have different ideas on what censored means and there could be the consequence of loosing many books but there are always consequence to every choice, good or bad.      In my personal experince, I have taken my ten year old sister to the library to barrow a movie and a few books. She is very scholary and comprehinds things quickly. Futhermore when she found a book that she thought @MONTH1 be interesting. The book turned out to be full of curse words and profanity. Think about it, what would you say to your child who just learned a few curse words from a place you expected to be a safe enviroment? To me it is rediculous to have to search every single book, cd, movie or magazine for profanity to make sure it is safe for my sister to read! Kids these days have changed majorly in their attitudes, language, and responses to things and I believe a big part of why is because of what they take in through the worldly materials. If the books and the music they read and listen to are offensive and rude then what else would they know other than to follow the lines of something more 'cool' than them. Therefore I believe that there should not be censored books in a library, and parents should have the right to ask for them to be removed.      When I sit back and realize what I would want my kids to be reading and listening to I wonder why people would even chance the fact that their child could be negativly influenced by it. Why tempt them to be someone that reflects profanity and offensiveness when they could be so much more? Parents should do everything they can to make their kids the best person they can be and I believe that they have a right to protect their children from not reaching their full potential. Therefore in the end books should be censored!",4,4
4113,"No, I believe all materials should be on the shelfs at libraries. Because some people like stuff other people @MONTH1 find offensive. But you as parents should control what your kids are reading. If you find it offensive tell them to pick out a new book, new @CAPS1, a new movie, or a new magazine. If you don't its not their fault it's your fault.     Some people like stuff that others don't. Such as, stuff from anther culture or maybe something from a different religion. But we can choose to read what ever you want to. If you don't like it find something else but, some people find it interesting. Not everyone has the same veiws on stuff. If there are books just for adults put it in anther room to were miniors can't get in. Make it to were you have to show an @CAPS2 that says you are @NUM1 or older to get in. Than you can look at inapporiate books without haveing to risk kids seeing them. Than in order to check them out if you're under the age of @NUM1 a parent or gaurdian has to be with you if you want to get it. If it's a @CAPS1 or musican that has cussing in it you need to be @NUM1 or older or have a parent check @NUM4 out for you. Because some parents don't let their kids listen to bad music.      Like I said in pervious paragraphs I believe that they should't take stuff off the shelfs that a few or some people @MONTH1 find inapproite. Because a few of us might find it interesting to know that this world isn't all the same. People are different like different things",3,3
3463,"I think they should'nt remove material from libraries if it's found offensive. People find different things offensive that others do not. If you started takeing these things out,thers a good possibility that you'll loose everything,books and your people.      One example I say this is because, some people are offensive bout movies that have violent scense in them. Others like the violence in those shows. The librarie might be the only way someone can get ahold of something they like.      Another example is, magazines can contain material you don't want your kids round or seeing. That same magazine could help a student with a assignment at school. Kids might need the material that is offensive,it could help them through life.       In conclusion I do not think we should take movies and books out if someone finds it offnesive. Some of the offensive material could be used to help students in there education. Other offensive material some adults enjoy reading or watching. Just because one person finds something offensive does not mean the next person that comes in will.",3,3
4600,"Censorship is method of limiting certain contant that has been deemed inapropriate. This method is widely used today in the modern world. Censorship is used most commonly with our movies, video games, and television. If other forms of entertainent like television and internet utilize such methods shouldn't our libraries.Also if these methods are not made manditory should there be a block on certain tittles that our children could get there hands on.       This limiting agent called censorship can be very usefull in our everyday lives. Censorship could allow us to keep track of what our children and teens view. This agent can currently be installed on such products as our televisions, computers, and phones. So if the procautionary measuers are being taken on the following products wouldn't it be appropriate for the actions to also be in our libraries. Shouldn't our libraries be a place for children to waunder through the shelves picking up and reading books at random without the thought of picking up an inaproiate book for their age group. Personally that is what a library should be like to me.         Discussing the topic that was touched on before .A block should be manditory for libraries. This block would not abolish the books completly but rather would limit their viewing audience. The books should be cateragized by age group. And with the block certain children, based on age ,would not be able to enter the section and would prevent certain materals from reaching children that are not mature enough.     Certain materials should not be view by younger children. That is not only a statement based on opinion but also of fact. The factual experiance comes into play when young children are reading and looking at pictures that were intended for maturer audiences. These tittles heavily influence a childs thoughts and actions. Just the other day a cousin of mine no older than @NUM1 years old was watching two individuals of the opposite sex and began asking questions such as: when are they going to kiss? or why is he not touching her? These questions do not come naturally but only through her viewing of material that she was not ready to view. The origin of these question will probably never be known but there are ways to prevent such topics from being brought up and that is censoring what children read, view or listen to in our libraries",4,4
3676,"The library is meant to be a place that is filled with materials of all different genres and types. Many of us go to the library because we are looking for something in particular, rather than just browsing. Although some materials that people need to research at the library @MONTH1 be considered inapproproate for certain audiences, it still serves as a useful resource for others. This @MONTH1 include getting information for a research paper, renting a movie that needs to be watched for school, or looking for a certain type of book to read. By taking certain books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves, we are limiting the amount of materials for people to borrow.     At many schools, students are asked to write research papers. What is considered a valid subject for a high school research paper @MONTH1 include information that is not suitable for all groups of people. A student @MONTH1 write a research paper on the effects a certain drug has on an individual. Just because the student chooses this topic, does not mean that he or she supports it. Some adults @MONTH1 say that information on drugs should not be on the shelves in a library because it @MONTH1 include material that they consider graphic, but a student looks at this material only as a resource for an educational purpose.     My freshman year we read @ORGANIZATION1 and @PERSON1. We also watched the movie to get a better understanding of the differences between our time periods. There is death and violence in the movie, along with a brief flash of nudity. Many would consider even this great literary work as a movie inappropriate. The movie helped us to get a real life picture of how things were back then. We were mature enough to look past the graphic scences and see the movie for what it really was. If this move was taken off the shelf, some people wouldn't have fully understood the story because they couldn't picture it.     Sometimes, we just want a good book to read. Many teens gravitate to the young adult section because it includes age-related material. Many books in this section @MONTH1 include works that have a dark or graphic theme with subjects that are inappropriate for younger children. If we eliminated books from this section because they are being censored, we will end up with even less teens that read. Certain books provide an escape for some teens, and @MONTH1 even help them to confront or deal with problems in their own lives.     If libraries start censoring books we @MONTH1 end up with less and less readers as the years go on. Instead of censoring the books, we should censor the people reading the books. If a parent doesn't want a younger child to read about a certain topic, then they should keep them away from that material. Libraries can put age approval marks on certain books to permit only certain age groups to read them. Authors of the books should not be punished for what they choose to write about by taking their books out of the library. No matter what a person's purpose for reading is, they should have a choice of what kind of material the book contains.",4,4
3313,"I believe that there should be a little censorship in libraries. There are some books out there that could be a little offensive and cause some problems, but I also believe that even if a book is insulting you shouldn't be able to hide it from others.     There are some books that have some pretty nasty stuff in them that you could find in a library. Since a library is public lots of people go in to get books. What is to stop a kid to getting to one of these books, or movies you can find in libraries? Do you really want a child to check something out that has violence, horrible language, and sexual innuedo? What can you do about this problem? You could censorship the books and hide them from the public, but that would cause another problem.     The idea of censorship might sound ok, but really it's not the right thing to do. Hiding things from the public just because it might have some bad things in it is a little over the top. If you are an adult and your in the mood to read something with a little violence in it you'd have to go somewhere else because someone just took that book away because it had some swear words that they don't find appropriate in books. Censorship would just make it harder for adults to find some books that they would want to read.     So what do you do if there is an offensive book on the shelf? Do you just leave it there, or take it away so no one can read it? You could just put age restrictions on the books. If someone underage wanted to check out the book, they would have to get permission from their parent. That way the book can stay on the shelf and be read by anyone",3,3
3900,"I believe that there are certain movies, music, and other things that are bothering parents. I would not whant my kid listening to music that has a lot of things that can teach you wether if its write or wrong, I would check the kind of music my child listens to to see if they are bieng tought bad things. I believe that there are some movies that are to violent for anyone to see, but this is a free country which us regular average people will watch any way. There are movies made for adults, but how many adults let their kids watch them to. No matter what they make there will be people who dont like what they see or they know somebody who didnt like what they saw.Some times there are people that dont like what they hear, or knows somebody who didnt like what they hear'd in music or on the television.  There are times my mom here's something on t.v or music and said turn that of. my friends all listen to this music that i dont think amounts to nothing but the production of inmates, and other wrong doings such as, gangs, fights, shootings, and jurry trials. there are things on the market that has an error of a certain group who might like action movies. Well there are kids out there learning those things they saw, and they are trying to do what they saw, becuase they think that it will make them look cool. There will always be things that peolpe do not like and will never like. I learned that when I was young, just like most young kids have. I think the biggest thing that sell's, is the dramma, action movies, and the stuff that parents will like. Very little of baby movies, and baby music. But what can you do about that? I like most of what I hear, and see. I have always thought there was a lot of violence, and picture shots, and things about drugs that just should not be on national television to teach the young.This is what I think.",3,3
3077,"It seems you cannot always make everyone happy. No matter what, someone is offended or upset over something. This holds true with everything- including media. Whether it be a book, movie, or a song, someone somewhere will be unhappy with it for some reason. Though this is true, it certainly does not mean you can take that media away from those who enjoy it. The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 of the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 @CAPS3 @LOCATION1 that all people are granted freedom of speech and freedom of press. Would taking 'offensive' material off of shelves not take away from this right so clearly and intently given to us? Not only that, but does sheltering the public and making us all believe the world is a place without bias, prejudice, or slander really help us in the grand scheme of things? Pretending that the world is perfect ensures that future generations of the world will be devestated by reality once they get out in the real world and realize everything is not perfect and nice and unbiased all the time.     My ninth grade year in high school, I read 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' by @PERSON1. This book demonstrates the harsh prejudice that used to be normal in the @LOCATION4 during the earlier years of the @LOCATION1. This book could certainly be considered offensive by a person living in the southern @LOCATION1; one could say this book steriotypes people in the @LOCATION4. One could also say this book is offensive because of the language it uses. African-@CAPS6 could be offended by the explicit rascist comments and names within the pages. Despite this, 'To @CAPS4 A @CAPS5' is considered a classic and is praised and tought throughout the @LOCATION1 and the rest of the world. I grew from reading @PERSON1's masterpiece- it tought me a lot about where the @LOCATION1 has been and how far it has come with acceptance of other races. You learn from your mistakes, they say. Therefore, we can learn from the media's mistakes. We can grow as people from being offended or having offensive material brought to our attention. We can stop history from repeating itsself by being well-informed.     Theology is a huge matter of dispute among all cultures; @CAPS9 or @CAPS10'ite, @LOCATION2, @CAPS11, @LOCATION3, @LOCATION5, @CAPS12. Any book store you walk into, you can find a bible or a book on atheism or even '@ORGANIZATION1,' which focuses on @CAPS13. Any music store you walk into, you can find bands that bash the ideas of religion, but you can also find theistic worship bands or meditating music. Just the same, any movie theater or movie store you visit could supply movies with anti-theistic or pro-theistic themes.Taking such things off of the shelves because one work could be offensive to a group of people could limit another's options to explore theology and find out what suits them. It could limit one's exploration of interests. It could very well take away from one's personal growth.     In any case, it is unfair to take something that could be considered offensive to one person away from another just for the sake of being nice and having discretion. Putting a ban on certain works could harm the flow of society. Putting a ban on certain works could limit one's awareness of the world around them or the history they could potentially be inspired by, it could limit the expansion of one's intellect, it could take away from one's exploration of interests or the search of who they really are or want to be. It is best to just keep things the way they are- free.",5,4
3982,"Should materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if found offensive? Censorship can be a huge deal depending on who you ask or where you go some find it necessary so kids do not get into these things found in librarys or some @MONTH1 not think it's so important.      Books are important parts of peoples lives, learning, etc, they are also read for many different reasons but some of the topics books are written about @MONTH1 not be right or could be innapropriate or possibly against all of someones beliefs or religion. I personally do not think that censorship is necessary to keep some things out of librarys just some thngs shouldnt be available for anyone to just walk in and pick up off of a shelf in a library maybe materials that are innapropriate for children or people @MONTH1 find offensive should be kept away in a different secluded section of a library and be clearly labeled of what the purpose of this room is so people will clearly know and won't really risk the chance of just stumbling upon those materials.     Another reason why censorship @MONTH1 not be necessary is that things that anyone could find in the library that @MONTH1 be offensive or innapropriate can be found just as easy if not easier on @CAPS1 or on the internet by anyone anytime of the day. @CAPS1 has some censorship but not enough to remove the effect that @CAPS1 show or movie or internet site could have on the minds of todays young people and children such as violence, drugs, language, and racism that is found in almost everything today. Todays children and young people should be taught of whats wrong even if they do think it's dumb or unecassary at the time when they mature they hopefuloly will see whay they were taught those things and why they should always try to stay away from things that are seen in movies, magazines, books, and mostly on @CAPS1 and not get involved with these activities.      Censorship I still believe is not necessary even though I know of all the innapropriate and harmful things in todays culture. Even though I know how harmful it can be if they see the effect it could have on their future and what it has done to other people that saw things in movies, books or even heard it in music if they could see and hear from people who have been affected by these things they would know to stay away from bad things and go along with whats right.     In conclusion censorship is not necessary, it could be in the future but if everyone is lead to what is right they will hopefully make the right decision and stay away from harmful books, movies, music, magazines, and other things alike.",4,4
4160,"Have you ever been to a library and found a book offensive?In my opinion I believe that books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are at the library for a reason. The reason being say if we wanted to check out a movie and everywhere else was to expensive to get it, why wouldn't you just get it at the library if they had it. Most libraries that I've gone to have certain sections for adults and children. That means there would be appropiate things for little children to read in the section that they have been given. If children under age were to wander off into the adult section that would be their fault if they saw something unapproiate not the libraries.     If the case was if every time a child or someone under age took a book offensive, I belive that the libraries wouldn't have as much of books in their buildinds that grown ups would like to read. Of course I'm not trying to say that there should be extermely unappropriate books wandering around in the library that the small children should see. I'm just saying that the adults do have the right to have books that they would be interested in.When I've gone to the libraries I have found books that I have enjoyed reading and I'm not the type of person that would just grab a book and be interested in right away. There are books, movies, magazines, and music that have strange titles that some people might take offensive to, but those are the ones that get read more or listend to more or watched more.     I believe that no material should be taken off of the shelf just because one person found it offensive. If the person doesn't like the idea of the people in the library not taking the material off; it's the person personal problem I think. For example there is this book called '@CAPS1' and it's about a teenager who got into drugs real bad and got pregnate at a young age. That book was one of the best selling books in the world. If somebody took that offensive and asked for the book to be removed then it's their loss.     I mean if there were a book about how to murder somebody then yeah I would ask for that material to be taken off the shelf immeditely. Except no library in this entire world would have that kind of stuff up so why worry about it.If there were ever to be that type of situation then that would be bizzare.But I highly doubt that it would come to a point like in time. So in conclusion that is my opinion on this",3,3
4568,"Works of literature are works of literature no matter what they contain.All liteature should be placed on the shelves of a library. If for some reason the material is offensive or deemed as crude then it should go into a restricted section where permission is required to enter. Literature is a strong item when it comes to persuasion. So we must take care of what we allow to be released or seen and to which eyes.     Literature is written by the author for many reasons. Perhaps the reason is to make money or to share a point of view but either way the author generally wants his or her literature to be read. How would the author ever achieve his or her goal if we decided to remove their hard work from the library shelves. It simply could not be read if it is not available. This is one reason why certain books should not be altogether removed from the library.     No matter how crude a topic @MONTH1 be it @MONTH1 still be needed by certain individuals. If there were images of a nude person in a scientific book that librarians did not want children to get their hands on then how would students study a topic such as sexual education or anatomy for a class? Of course there are people who simply want to see nudity for foolish pleasure and that is why permission should berequired to obtain these books. A small closed off room in a library should be sufficient to contain all the books deemed crude. This way the only access to the books would be to get a key from a librarian.     A book not read @MONTH1 as well never have been written. There is absolutely no point in destroying certain types of literature because some @MONTH1 feel offended. The simplest solution would be to simply make it so the only people to view these books would want or need to go view them. We simply can not lose certain pieces of writing because some parents do not trust their childs eye or because a person @MONTH1 be offended at the material. After all, when everybody has a chance to say what is offensive there will be no books left.",4,4
4006,"Many individuals vist different libraries all over the world everyday. Some for books, some for magazines, some for movies. Everyone has different taste so a libary is where they go, because they have absolutley everything.       Libraries have all kinds of amazing different books. It is where people of all ages go to find books or other materials that they would like to read or use for research. There should be no  limits on what  books, movies, magazines, ect., are on the shelf. Everyone has different beliefes/feelings on what they would like to read or see.     If libraries starting limitting their options, i don't think that they would have as much business and people would not read as much. Which means that an indivudal's @CAPS1 could go down. Reading helps everyone in this world, by learning new vocabualry and just excersizing their own eyes. By taking away someone's intrest, they won't read as much, or feel as free.     Just because someone doesnt like something, does not mean the next person won't. If a book or movie, ect., is offensive to someone they just just simply not read it or watch it. No one has the right to take over someones mind of what they are interested in.     However limmiting the age groups for certian items would not be a horrible idea. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive or not approiate for a young child should not be aloud to be seen or checked out by a young child, but that does not mean take it away from others.",3,3
4415,"Should certain materials in libraries be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? I do not think books or any other materials should be taken off the shelves for some people? There are many reasons that the books should stay on the shelves. I am going to tell you all of the reasons I think the books should stay on the shelves.     One reason I think the books should stay on the shelves is because some people might need the books for a school project. For example, a student could have a project over @CAPS1. A book on @CAPS1 could offend many people. Just because it offends some people does not mean it should be taken off the shelf because other people might need that book. Someone might need a certain book for a project. If the one book they need is taken off a shelf because it offended someone they could fail a class. That is one reason I think the books should stay on the shelves.     Another reason I think they should stay on the shelves it's their opinion if the book offends them. Just because they don't like the book and it offends them doesn't mean other people do not want to read it. Why would you take a book off of a shelf because it offends one or a couple people? There could be many more people who want to check out that book and read it.     If a book offends you just dont look at it. Why would you look at something that offends you? I don't understand why libraries would have to removed a book from the shelf just because it offends someone. Especially, when that person could just ignore the book and pay no attention to it. That is my last reason my opinion is what it is.     So after reading this I hope you understand why my opinion is what it is. There is no point in taking books off the shelves. People need them for research and projects. It is someones opinion if they do not like what the book is about and if it offends them. For example, if i didn't like something on a menu at a resteraunt they are not going to take it off the menu for me. My last reason the books should stay on the shelves is the people can just ignore the books and not look at them that would be easier than taking books off the shelves.                                    THE @CAPS3",4,4
4140,"I believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines and other thing can be removed from the shelf. I believe that when we are cleaning off the shelf that @CAPS1 should be removed from the shelf. Other times I don't belive they should be removed form the shelf unless you're cleaning up.      I'm a @CAPS2. I'm always trying to do the right thing. And everyday my parents have chores for me to do around the house and I believe that those should be done first insted of doing other things. And I think it's crazy to remove books and other things from a shelf unless a shelf a full of books and other things. And its something that would have to be done.      Removing anything from the shelf is not bad. But it is not something that had to be done all the time. It is something that some people might do. It is not my thing.  I'm always trying to be obedient and have good behavior around others",2,2
3807,"Every person is different, and in being different, people have many varying veiws as to what is or is not acceptable or offensive. Something that is very offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, it is all a matter of values and beliefs. Libraries contain a variety of books, music, movies, magazines, and other materials on a variety of topics, some of which @MONTH1 not be appropriate for everyone.     I do not believe that a material should be removed from shelves just because one person or a group of people find it offensive. The offended group is not being forced to read that book or magazine, listen to that music, or watch that movie. Materials are placed in a library for the public to enjoy, not just to please certain people.      I do beleive, however, that materials should be clearly sorted in a library. If they are clearly sorted, people are less likley to take something that offends them by accident, and can completely avoid books, movies, magazines, and music that they do not to read, watch, or listen to. This can also help keep children away from unwated material.      To conclude, materials should not be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. What is offensive to one person, another person might enjoy watching, listening to, or reading. It is impossible to please everyone, because every person has different veiws, but a situation can be avoided by careful organization. If everything that was found offensive to certain people was taken off of library shelves, there would be nothing left",4,3
4277,"'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2', 'The @CAPS3 @CAPS4', 'The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2'.  Do these titles sound familiar? They should, beause these are only a tiny fraction of the @CAPS3 literary masterpeices that people have enjoyed since their publications.  These wonderful books also share another characteristic, they have all been banned from certain libraries across the country and around the world.       When a child goes off to school ecah day, his or her parents are left to think that he or she will be getting a quality education that meets the stadards of their own core values and morals.  But certain parents @MONTH1 become outraged when they see the books shelved on schools library shelves that they see as wrong, and don't want their precious children exposed to such immoral concepts that go against their idea of what is right.  In all reality though, how is this helping anyone?     By keeping a student away from a book or subject, the person causing the censorship is limiting what that student can learn.  By censoring things people are not only kept from ideas that might shock them, but also from ideas that might make them think.  If a person cannot think for themselves, they cannot draw their own conclusions on things.  When one cannot think for oneself or make decisios for oneself, how can this person be considered a free individual.       Infamous dictators, such as @PERSON1, burned books to keep his citizens from thinking what he did not want them to think.  By banning a book in a school library, a parent is also keeping their child from thinking what they do not want them to think.  And when you want a book out of a shool library you are ot only keepig your child from reading this book, but everyone who goes to the school from reading the book. How is that fair?      So instead of wanting certain books to be off the shelves of your childs school, I say this.  Teach your children to be careful in what they read.  If you don't wan them to read 'The @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2' tell them not to read that book.  Tell your children to follow the moral guidelines you want them to follow, and if certain books keep them from having their own thoughs instead of yours, just tell them not to look, and don't bother everyoe else about it",4,3
3790,"I don't think they should publically exploit the books if certain people feel offended by it, but I personally do not get offended by anything so my opinion will be different than others. However, if the library recieves constant complaints about this issue then I could see why they would want to get rid of it.      So what i'm saying is that if it doesn't cause a problem for anyone other then a select few then I believe they should keep it but just let the offended know that the book  is going to be out of sight, therefore making the issue non-existant.      I don't think that librarians will intentually put out books that offend the public people on display in front of everyone to see, I believe that they just have the books for their purpose and that's to be read. I've been to the public library many times and out of all the times i've been I dont think i have seen a single thing that has offended me or made me un-comfortable.      The books are there for public reading and the growth of knowledge, without them I believe it would hurt our nation as a whole, due to the fact that we need knowledge to do things and the more knowledge we have the better our lives will be. So no, I believe libraries should keep all books unless it causes a big issue and many people are constantly bringing up the problem.",3,3
4567,"Many people claim that certain books should be allowed on @CAPS1 shelves.  They claim that these books can be offensive to some and, therefore, should not be read.  These books are known as '@CAPS2 Books.'  @CAPS3, librarians, and public officials have gone too far in thinking they should have the right to choose who reads certain books and who does not.     In the novel To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5, the author uses many words and descriptions that people find are very offensive.  These words, however, are essential to the setting of the novel.  The author is not claiming that she personally feels that @CAPS6 @CAPS7 should be described in the way that they are, but a racist individual, such as @PERSON3 or many people during the time period, would not hesitate to describe them in such a way.  The novel, To @CAPS4 a @CAPS9, is a great way for people to understand the history of the @CAPS10.  Without the descriptions in the novels, a piece of history would unknown to many.     The novel, @PERSON4 in the @CAPS11, attempts to delve into the life of a pubescent, whiney, teenager.  The author, @PERSON2, uses many curses in the dialogue between characters.  The charachters, however, are high school boys that live at a boarding school.  To water down the language or to make the novel 'kid friendly' would make it impossible to describe the true nature of the characters.  The novel also contains multiple references to sexual situations.  These situations, although offensive to some, are necessary to show the progression of plot as well as the changing charachter traits of the protagonist, @PERSON1.     Literature is not the only medium being targetted by those trying to completely censor libraries.  Music, movies, magazines, and videogames are being targeted as well.  In many cases, certain materials should not be viewed by young children or those who lack the maturity to handle them.  It should be remembered that it is the @CAPS3 responsibility to censor materials for their children.  Instances of violence, prejudice, and death are a diurnal occurence.  @CAPS1 patrons should not be shielded from these occurrences.     In conclusion, many times it is necessary for an author to use words or descriptions that are offensive to many. Librarians should not be given control over which materials reach the shelves in libraries.  Libraries should present a wide variety of books, movies, etc. to the public.  If libraries do this, it becomes the responsiblity of either the @CAPS3 or the individual to pick out books that are within personal boundaries",5,5
4616,"I thnk the censorship in libraries @CAPS1 quite abominomal. I think there should be no censorship, it @CAPS1 for the parents to decide what children can an cannot watch. I think if something @CAPS1 found offensive, then don't watch it, it's as simple as that. If you don't want your children to watch anything offensive or rude, then don't let them.     What I think offensive, @CAPS1 when something @CAPS1 removed off shelves. I think kids, though not yung kids, perhaps @NUM1 and up, should be able to watch and listen to what they want. I think certain things that people find offensive, are only offensive to those kind of people. It @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else, so don't take that particular movie, or song out of libraries.A good example of this would be the book, To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4. It has been banned and then unbanned from many school libraries, because of its vulgar words and references to rape. i think that @CAPS1 unfair because , wether we like it or not, children @NUM1 and over will most definatly hear rude and offensive things anyways.      I think books, or movies, or music, that have curse words, @CAPS1 a part of life, because most adults curse. And taking those things away from a library @CAPS1 taking it away from adults as well as kids. It @CAPS1 for the parents to decide when their kids hear these things, if at any time. I also believe that using ' offensive' remarks, @CAPS1 just another part of our history. Take To @CAPS2 A @CAPS4 for instance, back in that time, it was common for black people to talk slang, and common for men to curse when mad. That @CAPS1 just how people are and were.      Taking those things off the shelves, will not protect adolescents from hearing them. I think they have rights to hear it if they want, and there parents have rights enough to let them. I think songs that have words bleeped out over the radio @CAPS1 pointless because you teenager will know what they say anyway. I think having books banned @CAPS1 a not wise thing to do, because it just makes kids want to hear the word more than usual.     Basically we have rights to hear and read those things. Taking away the things we have rights to, @CAPS1 taking away our freedom and free will. If parents don't want to have their children read or hear those things, then they need to supervise what they read or listen to. It doesnt't make snese to single out a particular book, or song, that @CAPS1 just like singling out all songs and books",4,4
3645,"I think certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive because the word is just saying 'OFFENSIVE', or those things should be placed where not everybody can get it, like the little kids or when your religion doesn't accept that kind of things. For example in my opinion there are some books, music, movies or magazines that show images or words that are offensive, and not just for me or other people too. Offensive for me is when its not an appropriate thing like certain images, videos or bad words that should not be use  for everybody to hear or see. You have to be careful when you think something is offensive because not everyone thinks like you, and everybody has a different opinion and conclusion and we have to remember, we have the power to talk, read and write what we think is best. I'm not saying that they should prohibit certain books or music, I'm just saying that there is time for everything and we are young and we are looking for a good future, not just for us also for the younger kids and the older people have to provide us the best they can, because they have experience and they know what is best for their kids. This is a free country and people should express their opinion and make it worth, if you think something is being bad say it, and its important to remember do not let people offend you with words or images and don't let them force you to do something offensive for someone else",3,3
4686,"What do you want your children to be able to see in their public library? As we all know, there are things like books, picture, and movies that we do not want our younger generation to see. This is @CAPS1 parents are so carful with computers, and what their children have access to.      Every situation has it's pros and cons, but in @CAPS2 cases if you analize the pros and cons you can come to an accurate conclusion. When you go to a library with your children, the children run off to do what they want, usually to the children's section. Let's face it, children do not want to look at adult book. Once children learn to read you might come across a bigger problem. As children get older they want to be able to do more things, like watching older movies, reading harder books, and look at want they want on the computer.      I'm sure that the first thing that might come to mind is to censor the library, take away the horror films, the banned books excetra. This might be fine at first, but what about the adults that have every right to read and watch whatever they want. The library is free, does this mean that if our society does not like a book, movie, or magazine taht the adults must go somewhere else to pay for a particular book or movie as apposed to borrowing if for free at the public library. It could work, but if a child is going to look at bad things at a library what will stop him/her from looking at them at a bookstore?           Another issue is banned books. @CAPS2 of them are classics that past generations have read in school. @CAPS1 would we decide to take these books away now? It makes it seem like the younger generations can not handle it, or that past generations have something to hide. The definition of a classic is a piece of writing that has stood the test of time. Does it just end here and now? @CAPS1 would we take the classics away? Let's face it, if the classics are not read in school today, and they are not read in the next generations what is stopping them from being forgetten? Some banned books parents will look at and say, '@CAPS1 would this be banned? I do not remember anything bad in it.' @CAPS2 of the time the classic banned books were written some time in the @DATE1, @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 or the @CAPS6 @CAPS7. Society was different then. When you read a classic it acts as a history book to show us how it was to live during the time it was written. Usually the book will be banned because of bad language which people thing should be taken out of our schools, but they are missing the point. That was how things were back then so, who are we to hide it?      Does this mean that I think anything and everything should be put in our public libraries? Not at all. Some magazines can be avoided, or be put in a section away from younger children's eyes. Horror movies do not have to be taken out completly, just put in a different section. If parents are worried about monetering their children on the internet there is nothing stopping them from watching their children while they are using a computer.      I think that there can be come cesorship in libraries, but sometimes our society goes overboard. As long as we keep an open mind and make the right decisions for our future generations we can make our country a safe yet edjucational place to learn",4,4
4387,"Do you think books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that could be offenesive should or should not be pulled off the shelves? I beleave they shouldn't. All kinds of people buy books or movies and they all have diffrent types they like.     Companies that manufactor books, movies, music, and magazines would be looseing out on money if people cant find something they like. and if they dont have the money to make whatever it is they make then they will go out of buiesness. They you might be out of luck for what you are looking for.     All kinds of people buy things that they like. How would you like it if your favorite candy was taken off the shevles because it offened people? Well thats how they feel when that happens to them.      What would be put in there places? Stores have to have something to fill the shevles. Would they put more candy to make the world fat?      If you come across something you think is offensive just dont pay attenion to it. Others @MONTH1 like it like you like your favorite candy. We have a great number of other things you can pick from",3,3
3716,"Should libraries remove offensive reading material? No, I don't think certain reading material should be removed from libraries just @CAPS4 some people find @CAPS5 offensive. There's offensive material everywhere. Just because you find @CAPS5 offensive doesn't mean someone else does. In my opinion if a person finds something offensive they shouldn't look at @CAPS5 or read @CAPS5.     A few months ago I was at the library. I was trying to find a book to read for an essay I had to write. I over heard two girls talking. They were arguing about something. I moved closer to them so I could hear. '@CAPS1's this one about?' The girl asked. 'That's a really good book! @CAPS5's about these two people who fall in love and their love lives. @CAPS5 goes on to talk about how the man tries to find a woman after the girl he fell in love with dies, and about his love life after @CAPS6's gone.' The other girl said. 'So you're saying @CAPS5's about sex?' The first girl asked. '@CAPS2, but only slightly.' The other girl answered. 'I'm not going to read this!' The first girl said. '@CAPS3 why not?' The second girl asked, confused. '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 talks about sex! Teens shouldn't be able to check out books like this.' The first girl answered, '@CAPS5 sends the wrong message.' @CAPS6 added. After those girls left I went and got the book they were talking about. I started reading @CAPS5. Intresting. Actually, @CAPS5 was a very good book. The second girl was right. @CAPS5 wasn't mainly about sex. @CAPS5 was mostly about the love those two people shared for each other and @CAPS1 the man went through after his love died.     That got me thinking. Should certain reading material be removed because @CAPS5 talks about sex, drugs, murders, ect or @CAPS4 someone finds @CAPS5 offensive? No, @CAPS5 shouldn't. There's offensive material in real life and @CAPS5's not being removed. Why should @CAPS5 be removed from a library? @CAPS1's @CAPS5 matter if @CAPS5's in a book? There is always going to be something somewhere that offends someone. That's just how life is.",3,4
4768,"Books, movies, magazines, music, etc., make up a huge part of our entertainment system in our lives today. Whether it be informational or just purely for entertainment, many forms of entertainment are found in your local library today, whereas in the past most libraries only contained books. Although, our entertainment today is much different then it was back then and will be much different than it will be in the future.      In today's society books, magazines, music, movies, and so on can be found in your local library, and contain many different types of material. Some material could be informational about our solar system or about the human body. Other material could be a fiction story filled with action, horror, or love. Some material could also be filled with true, life changing, and inspritaional storries. Which ever it @MONTH1 be, these types of things @MONTH1 come off as offensive to some people more than others and @MONTH1 not be apporpriate for younger ages.     Certain books, movies, magaizines, music, ect., containing offensive, inappropriate, or rude material shouldn't be banned from libraries, just because those younger than adults should not read them, or becuase those who dislike the material believe that that material does not belong in the library. Generally most libraries are quite large and organized into various sections throughout the building. One area might be for fiction books and another for non-fiction books, another area could be for childrens books, and another for magazines, movies, music, ect., all based on different types and genres. Simply do this for those materials that should only be read by adults and not for children or teens. Take the books that @MONTH1 contain offensive material, or @MONTH1 be inappropriate for those younger than adults and place them in their own divided section in the library. When a book from that section is being checked out merely ask for an @CAPS1 from the person checking that book out to make sure that they are of age. This can also apply to movies, magazines, music, and so on that are placed in that section.     Some materials found in libraries that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to others. Taking those offensive materials out of the library won't benefit everyone and @MONTH1 disappoint some of the people who don't find that material offensive. Placing these certain materials in their own section is the best way to go to benefit everyone.      As you can see just because one person @MONTH1 find certain material in magazines, books, music, movies, ect., offensive, rude, or inappropriate, doesn't mean that everyone else does. It also doesn't mean you should completely take out and get rid of all the materials that are found to contain offensive or innapropraite material. Dividing those specific materials into their own section, and regulating who @MONTH1 check them out is really the best way to go. It benefits everyone at best so that those who want to read that material can still go to their library and check out that book, magazine, and so on, and those who wish to not have anything to do with that certain material don't have to worry about finding material that is offensive or inappropriate, because they will be in their own divided section",3,4
3765,"Censorship in Libraries     The library presents to the community many different things for entertainment. They's a large variety of enterianment such as: romance movies, adventurous novels, dramatic music, comical magazines, and many others. Yet they're are some that have unappropriate things. I believe that any of the things in the libraries that have unappropriate things in them should be censored or removed from the public view. If this is done it will benefit our children's moral beliefs, the library's family image, and save money for better things.      Our children are the most important things to us. They are the future of our country and our world. They are the people who will be leading our country. We teach our children from a young age our moral beliefs. Yet, if they start seeing or reading unappropitate things that they can find at a library then their moral views will change. They will think that the things they see are okay in society because it's in a library.      If the library, which is thought to be one of the most educational places, has bad things then the image of the library will be thought as bad and dirty also. The library needs to censor the bad things to allow their self image to look well. Many parents won't want to take their children to the library if they know that there can be a magazine of death and murder laying out on the shelves.      The library would also save alot of money if they censored the things they have. Many of the pornagraphical things they have cost alot of money. Usually if they buy movies that aren't censored it cost extra. If they buy things that are approptiate they would benefit greatly. They could us that money and buy better books and at a lower price.     The library is a very important part to one's community. We need them in our lives and our children's lives also, but we won't take our children if we know that the things there aren't good for them. That's why the library need to censor the unapproptiate things so that the parents feel safe when going to the library. The library is a fun place to go, and it would be even better if everything there was good and not bad",4,4
3042,"I @CAPS1'@CAPS2 think that books should be censored. There are no books, besides maybe math books, that @CAPS1'@CAPS2 offend at least one person or a group of people. Books are an important part of the learning system. If a certain book offends you then you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 have to @CAPS3 @CAPS4. @CAPS4's that simple. there is no need to over react to words on paper. Besides there are more important issues at the moment.     While being offended by a book is bad, we must realize that some people are going through things that are way worse than that. People who do drugs or have a family member that does drugs are an example. A better example would be the parents or gaurdians of a kid who was killed either by accident or on purpose. One of the most common but overlooked examples is the what the loved ones of people who die serving our country go through. As you can see if people can live with that then we can definantly handle an offensive book.      Censorship causes blidness. What I mean is, if we censor one offensive book then we have to censor every book that someone finds offensive. All men are created equal, right? So they'd have to censor the book. If a book offends you that much then listen up, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4! Just because a book is offensive to you doesn'@CAPS2 mean @CAPS4's offensive to everyone. sometimes a history book could be considered offensive so we censor @CAPS4 and then we @CAPS1'@CAPS2 learn about the mistakes of our past and repeat them. The point is if a p erson can handle some of the things I've mentioned, then we can all handle a little bit of words on a little bit of paper.",4,4
3499,"Do you think books, magazines, or movies that are offensive  should be removed from the shelves stores and libraries?    In my opion, I think that the boss or manager of the stores should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries that are offensive to adults and kids.      Today I will inform you @NUM1 reasons why boss or managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of stores and libraries that are offensive to some people and kids.     One reason, why the boss and managers should removed books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that some times kids go the stores and when the parents are about to pay what they are going to buy kids always get a magazine or a book and start reading it and probaly the magazine or the book have something nasty or inappropriate for kids and they  should not be looking at and the parents do not but attention to what their kids are looking.     Another reason, why the boss and managers should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves of the stores and labraries is that for some people when they look at the magazines or books front cover and they see a picture from their culture or traditions and the people who did the magazine or the book wrote someting about thier culture or tradition that the person thinks that was not right or might not be true what they wrote about their culture or tradition and the person might get mad or insulted about what they read about their culture or tradition.My last reason why boss or managers should removed the books, magazines or movies from the shelves stores and libraries is that when I go to labraries and I see this little kids waching at the books or magazines and the magazines look nasty or inappropriate I get questinable and in my mind I said 'why the boss or mangers don't removed the books or magazines from the shelves if they look nasty or  inappropriate and that might be something  bad to show them. If the libraries should be good for kids/teenagers and adults for study  in the libraries they should not have offensive books or magazines.In conclusion, I think that the boss or manager of stores or libraries should removed the books, magazines, or movies from the shelves stores and libraries  because they might be offensive to some people and more for their kids. I all ready explind my reason why the boss and manager should removed the books or magazines from the shelves stores and libraries",2,3
3201,"Censorship in Libraries     @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising.     Some things I have expierenced is with the launguage it contains. I have seen some books, magazines, music, and movies have are cusswords. Also some @MONTH1 have racism things in it that you don't like. Another thing is that @CAPS1 is some bad persuading such as bad things that you hear or see and you wonder what it would be like to do that stuff.     Also another thing are advertisements. Some things a magazine can contain are about advertising tobacco, such as its good for you to try. Other ads are alcohol ads like a picture of someone with a beer or whiskey in @CAPS1 hand, and we think its cool to try it, but its not. The last thing that is really bad in advertisement is drug advertisement, such as a picture of a drug leaf, or inscents. It is bad to do drugs because it can ruin you whole career in high school and maybe in college.     The last thing are pictures and scenes. In movies, @CAPS1 could be scenes that you don't approve of. In some magazines @CAPS1 can be pictures in which you don't approve in either. So things that I have seen are pictures and scenes in movies and magazines that have innapropiate scenes, and innapropiate pictures.     Some things are like what pictures it contains, launguage it contains, and what kind of advertising @CAPS1 is. On the library shelves it contains books, music, movies, and magazines. You @MONTH1 be wondering why they don't take the bad stuff off the library shelves. @CAPS1 are alot of things on the library shelves that you @MONTH1 be concerned about.",4,4
3574,"Practice @CAPS1 You @CAPS2     The @LOCATION1 is considered one of the greatest countries in the world because it is a free country. In the @DATE1's people migrated here to escape the control that their government had in their homeland. In @LOCATION2 we practice freedom of speech. If we censor materials like books, music, movies, etc. it would defeat the entire purpose of @LOCATION2 and it's @ORGANIZATION1.     Everyone has their own personality with likes and dislikes. Not everyone likes the same music or is interested in reading the same subject, thats why its wonderful that their is a variety of everything. If you start banning or censoring certain things then how will people learn? There is nothing wrong with learning about negative things because that teaches people lessons so they know @CAPS1 or @CAPS1 not to do if in that situation. When you censor 'bad things' it creates naive thinkers, which only leads to discrimination.      I agree that for children there should warnings for material that parents @MONTH1 find offensive. For example, movies have ratings for different age groups, and books could do the same. Of course its up to the parents if they want to follow the recommendations but banning something all together is not neccessary.     I personally learned a lot of things from @CAPS1 I've seen on television. Whats on television @MONTH1 be considered 'street smart' education but that is good. Today we live in a scary and violent society, so being 'street smart' is an advantage. If television was censored then people would not know @CAPS1 to do in a bad situation because they have never experienced or seen of it before.     If books, movies, magazines, music, etc. are removed from shelves then @LOCATION2 is not practicing @CAPS1 it preaches to the many of people who come here in search of freedom.",4,4
4240,"I think they souldnt be pulled off the shelves because everyone has different opions . one person @MONTH1 think a book is offensive but the next @MONTH1 not. Some people @MONTH1 think any books with god or jesus in the are offensive but that @MONTH1 just be because it is not there religion. If every person took off a book that they thought was offensive  there would be no books left. Because people think differently. Or some @MONTH1 not like the @PERSON1 books because of the violence and goryness but to some people those are there favorite books, so that would be unfair to the ones who like the books that others dont. There are many books out there that not everybodys gonna like the difference is how you think and what you think is right and wrong",2,2
3443,"Censorship or not? That is the question. Many people @MONTH1 not realize it, but what they read and watch greatly affects them. If children watch a scary movie, then nightmares seem to occur more often. If teens read a book where parties seem cool and bad  things are glorified, they too start to see bad as good. What if @CAPS2 article you are reading right now contained offensive language and inappropriate ideas? Most people would be offended and complain. I fyou saw an old man walking down the street yelling out obtrusive things, you would be mad and tell him to quit. So then the question is arised, why is it alright for us to watch movies like @CAPS2? Yes, books and movies should be censored.     Children are very naive at a young age. When a child starts getting exposed to violence, illegal acts, alcohol and drugs in books or movies, they start to think it's okay. For instance, when I was younger, I watched the movie '@CAPS1.' @CAPS2 movie contains a profanity every other word, so it seems. I saw my favorite actors on @CAPS2 movie saying bad words, so I figured it was alright. It's not okay for a child to talk offensively like that. One day I even heard a little @LOCATION2 quoting lines from the '@CAPS3.' @CAPS2 movie is hilarious but extremely suggestive. It made me sad to hear an innocent little @LOCATION2 talking about things that are way over his head.      Teenagers that listen to music from @LOCATION1 or @LOCATION2 are getting bad messages. Although these two rappers are seen as modern day music heroes, they shouldn't be glorified the way they are. They're songs are all about smoking weed and getting high. They make it seem cool. So teenagers think, '@CAPS5 if they can do it, so can I!' They start to engage in activities that were once frowned upon. If teenagers were't exposed to @CAPS2 kind of music, they wouldn't be as apt to take part in such things.      As for adults, their movies and books should be censored too. One @MONTH1 think that once they're older they can do waht they want, but that's not the case. Let me throw out an example to you. Let's just say a husband and wife are watching a movie together. It's great until a rather, inappropriate ,shall we say, scene comes on. Not only does it make things awkward, but it sends out the wrong message. When adults or unmarried people see their favorite actors being naughty on television, it makes it seem right. They start to lose the concept that you are supposed to remain abstinant until marriage. After all, it is the only way to remain free of any diseases.      If movies, books, magazines, and music continue to be left uncensored, the world will become a giant brouhaha. People will begin to lose the sense of what is right and what is wrong. We are on the brink of violence and total chaos. If we contiue to let our children and ourselves watch these types of movies and whatnot,things will get ugly. Yes, if libraries or stores find anything offensive on their racks, then they need to censor it before it corrupts any more minds",4,4
3566,"Should offensive or graphic books be removed from the libary? Well,in my point of view I think books, music, movies, magazines, etc.. are amazing, exciting and fun to read or watch they should not be removed from the shelves in the local libary. For a fact people in general have many types of tastes in books thier's drama, romance, action and many other that also apply to movies, magazines and etc. The public should not be punished for one's intreast in themes, and how they take the book. Thier should be an age limit in witch kids can't read certain books and those of age should read whatever they please.          I, myself  like to read scary books, they give me chills and all types of questions runing through my brain. Someone else from my community could have the same trait of thought I have when reading a scary book. Without books that don't fit are personality thier would be less people in libaries reading and more people trying to keep themseleves occupied and half of them might even get bored and start commiting crimes, to keep there self  occupied. People in the community have rights to read, hear or watch witch ever type of material they like.      If people really do have a hard time with some of the material that is on display, they should not even pick it up to begin with. They should look for stuff they would enjoy, not just because the book is about 'violence' or just simply don't like the theme they, should not hold it against other people that might enjoy it. Books and other material were meant for us to enjoy them and from the authors or directores choice to share with us thier stories. Without books like those many people can't get ideas to help them creat thier own book or novel.      So that is my view on the situation, people should enjoy whatever material they like. But, if you are one of those people that think books, movies, magazienes should be removed, take a day and read a book or see a movie from your local libary and see how it will change your mind",4,4
3221,"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found affensive? No, I do not believe that. Simply because if one person is offended by a book and or materials in a library someone else will argue because they like the thing that was taken out of place for that person's beliefs and values.           I believe that if you don't like what is in the library you go to then don't go back, or just keep to yourself at least don't make a scene. There are a lot of racism being thrown around in books and songs and magazines but nobody takes that away. You just don't listen to it or you don't read it. If you would like to protest something that isn't in your beliefs or something that offends you, then go right ahead. It's good to defend yourself.      I remember when I was about @NUM1, I went to a hotel in @LOCATION1 with @CAPS4 family and a family friend. And the guy @CAPS4 dad invited to come was @PERSON1. He isn't racist but he does joke about how people dress and he sometime gets out of hand with @CAPS6 comments on the racist names, but we tolerate him. So we go to check in at the hotel and the check in/ check out person at the counter was @CAPS1 @CAPS2. We pay for our room with no problem and we stand there patiently waiting for @PERSON1 to step up and ask for a room. @CAPS4 father asked him what he was doing, because he was just standing there looking at the person behind the counter. @PERSON1 looks at us and smiles, then he pulls out a pamplet from @CAPS6 shoulder bag and hands it to the girl behind the counter. @CAPS3 I have no idea what the pamplet said or what kind of pictures was on it, but when he handed it to her she dropped it, looked up at him with tears in her eyes, and flipped him off then walked to the back and got this man.      As this rather large man walks around the counter towards @PERSON1 @CAPS4 father steps in the picture. @CAPS4 dad starts to talk to the guy but he doesn't seem to notice @CAPS4 dad because he was so focused on @PERSON1. @PERSON1 says, ' @CAPS3 look I was only kidding with the girl, she needs to learn how to take a joke.' @CAPS4 mom takes  me and @CAPS4 brothers up to our room and trys to get @CAPS4 father to come with us instead he promises us he'll be right up.      A good half an hour later @CAPS4 dad comes through the door with @PERSON1 close behind. I asked them what was on the paper he handed the lady, and @CAPS4 father says it was an aids pamlet he got from a rest stop. I looked at @PERSON1 and I said, '@CAPS5'd you give that to her?' @CAPS6 reply was well @CAPS7 a lot of people have aids but it's kind of an iside joke about 'blacks' and aids. So I just didn't really pay much attention to him anymore and I talked to @CAPS4 father. @CAPS4 dad said the reason @CAPS5 she got so upset was because her mother died from aids just a year ago. Which of course @PERSON1 never knew about all that. But I'm sure he learned @CAPS6 lesson. He should have just left her alone.      So you see these things are a problem but nobody removed us. We stayed there all weekend. Of course her and @PERSON1 exchanged some hateful looks but we looked past that, and she moved on with her life. I still don't think you should have to remove something just because someone esle don't like it",3,4
4293,"There are many books, movies, and magazines on shelves that can offence people in many ways. These can be books of war, slavery, and even religion that could aggrevate people and make them feel the need for them to remove those books from the libraries without hesitation.      There are indeed many books out there that could offence people and could be discriminating, but should those books really be taken out? I believe that books were made for a purpose. Each book and even magazine has a fact of information regarding what is either happening in the world or what could happen. Even for the books that are unrealistic they are also made for a reason and should be allowed to have their place in the library.      The library has over thousands of books and movies to choose from. If there even was one book that someone found discriminating or offensive they could always just pass by it and choose one that suits what they want. I feel that it is the person's choice of what they want to read or watch not the books or movies fault.     The books and movies are also split into genres into which each movie and book belongs in. So if you don't specifically want to see something than you can just skip the section the movies or books are in that you find discriminating and go to the ones that you feel okay with.      There are also many books and movies out there that might seem discriminating but they could actually teach you about life and what could happend and how to solve these problems. One example is when I was child growing up I was reading about this girl getting into a car accident and loosing everything just because she was drunk while she was driving. My mother didn't want me reading the book, but it actually helped me alot because it taught me the valuable lesson of never drinking and driving, because of reading that book at such a young age and implanting the story in my head I know that I will never in my life do what that girl did to herself.      This shows that even if a book might seem discriminating and wrong it can still teach people life lessons and danger that they probably wouldn't know about unless they read that book or watched that movie.      I feel that even if we removed the offensive magazines, books, and movies that don't have any potential what so ever, people would still find a way to get what they were looking for, even if it is from the library or not. There are many people that are wrong in this world and banning certain books from the library probably wouldn't stop them from doing what they want to do.      Music is another thing that shouldn't be that troubled about. Some people listen to certain types of music to calm their nerves down. One example is the @CAPS1 rapper @ORGANIZATION1. His songs consist of severe sadness and frequent cussing, but in his songs are messages that can relate to other people and listening to that certain song might stop them from doing illegal things or even commiting suicide. The songs can symbolize their lives and make them know that they are not the only ones living that way and that they aren't always alone in what they do.      I feel that each book, movie, and magazine has at least one thing that a person can find offensive. If we start removing each one that someone finds offencive than there probably wouldn't be a single book left on the library shelves.      The books we read, the magazines we glance at, and the movies we watch will probably have something offensive in them but I do not think that they should be censored or removed becasue there is always a chance that those books, movies, or magazines could help you out later in life",4,4
4488,"I think that movies, and magazines should be censured to kids at the library. There are many reasons these things should be censured and in this paper I am going to explain why they should be censured. I am also going to give a few examples of some stuff that shouldn't be possible for kids to get.      The main reason movies should be censured is because movies that are rated @CAPS1 are not only supposed to be rented by children but it wrong to rent these movies to them. I mean if there is a sex scene or something and your only like eight years old this would be awkward for the parents to explain what the actors are doing. I mean if you were a parent would you want to explain to your eight year what sex is.      The next thing that I think should be censured at the library is magazines. I know three in perticular off the top of my head, and they are @CAPS2, @CAPS3, and @ORGANIZATION1. These three magazines talk about how to be better in bed. I really don't any kid, teenagers included should need to know how to be better in bed. They also have several unhealthy diets that teenagers might try. This could cause them to get very sick and if they're already skinny, they could possibly die.      Well this pretty much sums up what I think about library contents being censured. I don't really think there are many books that are that bad for kids ears and eyes. I mean there are romances but I don't think any kid is going to last thru a whole romance, because they are pretty boring. Well I hope this will prevent libraries from letting kids get ahold of this kind of content",3,3
4375,"Censorship is when a group of people agree that a certain book, song, movie, or magazine is found offensive in any way. Mainly parents and educators find these materials such as books offensive and do what they can to get this book taken out of libraries at schools. Censorship was originally started during the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' in @LOCATION3 with the @CAPS3 @CAPS4. It was used to hide information from the public by taking all records of it away from the public's use.      In @LOCATION2, we are a democracy, but we still choose censorship to hide certain information from certain people. In some parents' opinions books are great and educational for children, but in other parents' opinions books do things like promote homosexuality, use false language, or even show drug use. Most of these books are not trying too promote these things but they are just part of the story. So pretend like we hide all the bad events or situations in the world from occuring infront of our children. They have no knowledge of this part of life, so what happens when they get in the real world and grow up? We can't just hide drugs from them, we can read these and teach them the harm drugs can do to someone and how to avoid them. If we send our children out into this world without any knowledge of drugs things will get out of control. Majority of these books that contain 'harmful' things to children, but they teach lessons that parents don't think of, they just think of what written down on the paper instead of the moral overall lesson that the story is bringing to a child. If a story has false language, our child will ask us what these words mean and we will tell them not to use them and what they mean so the child knows not to repeat them. If not, they can go into school and another child will tell your child to say these words and your child (not knowing the meaning of the word) will go out and say it and be awarded with a detention or even a suspension. Personally, I don't want my child receiving a detention or suspension.      Censorship is a growing issue in the @LOCATION1. It can do good things like hide actual sexual interactions from children, which should be hid from children anyways. Censorship can also do the bad things like I discussed earlier, which do more harm on a child then good. When your asked on your opinion on sensorship, just always remember what's best for your child, and knowledge is always better then clueless",4,4
4657,"Some children take books off the shelf that some old people can't read now a days. Some people taken books off and taken them and broken, take pages off of them",1,1
3633,"In libraries there are certain materials on the shelves that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.I have seen some of these materials in with my own eyes. But Should libraries take them off the shelves because of this matter? Thats the question. Some might find it offensive and others @MONTH1 not. It all depends on the person. Libraries cant please everyone.      In my opinion libraries should not take these materials off the shelves, because a material that they take off the shelf could be a material that another person enjoys. Just because you dont take the material off the shelf doesn't mean that there aren't other solutions for those that think the materials should be tooken off the shelfs.     Some solutions to fix this problem could be to take these 'offensive materials' and put them on taller shelves or in a room by thereselves so that children or people who do not like the idea dont have to see these certain materials.Then 'people who find it offensive' and 'people who dont' both get a side in this matter and it solves the solution to the problem.      If this solution doesn't work there are many more. The librarie can take out the really offensive materials and replace them with others more suitable for all.      Overall I do not think libraries should take out these materials. Just try to make people on the offensive and nonoffensive side both happy then there will be no more conclusions as in this one.",3,3
4246,"Every parent wants to protect their child's innocence. They do not want their children to come in contact with things that might influence their decisions. The truth is though that they are going to run into these types of things eventually, whether it be from other kids at school, what they see on television, or what they see on the @CAPS1. It is their choice as of what decisions they are going to make, so I do not think libraries should be censored due to the content of the material.     One reason libraries should not be censored is because nobody is forcing a person to pick up material that might have offensive content. It is all about choices. There are a lot of other options on the shelves that do not include such topics. Some people @MONTH1 want to read or watch something with such content. Taking these pieces out of libraries would not be fair to them. People should have the option to read or watch what they wish. Censoring libraries would take away these people's right to such topics.     Another reason libraries should not be censored is that eventually nothing would be left. As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 is a very true statement. After one censoring, people might still think topics are inappropiate, and the libraries would have to be censored again and again until there is nothing left. People eventually will not be able to use libraries. Losing libraries as an option will cause people to lose their right to that resource.      A final reason that libraries should be left uncensored is the difference of opinions. What @MONTH1 be offensive to one person might not be to another. How would what should be gotten rid of and what should not be decided? It would be much easier to just leave the people to make their own decisions on what okay to read and watch and what is not. Nobody is forcing people to pick up a book or magazine that is going to offend them. If you do not like what is being discussed, do not read or watch it. It is as simple as that.      There are many more reasons libraries' content should not be censored, but here are three reasons that are obvious. Censoring libraries are going to eliminate a person's choice. It will cause problems, as to what is appropiate and what is not. Eventually libraries will have nothing left. Of course every parent wants to protect their child, but eventually they are going to grow up and have to make their own choices. Censoring libraries is not going to stop children from learning about offensive things. All you can do as a parent is raise them well and hope that you have taught them right from wrong.",4,4
4083,"Have you ever wanted something removed from the shelves of a library because you thought it was offensive? If so, how did you go about the situation and what did you want done about it? I know in my experiences I have found some things that were offensive, so I am sure that they are out there. I think there are so many rules, qualifications, or standards that can give someone reason to take something off a shelf, and those can be different for everyone.      If you were in a children's library or a school library, I am sure most people would agree that any book with offensive language, situations, opinions, etc. should be removed from the shelves. Now if you were in a public library in the teenage or adult section and those same books that were inappropriate for the children's library are in the teenage or adult section, that might be admissable. The audience is different; therefore, the types of literature, music, movies, etc. can be more opinionated, mature, and controversial. Part of why something should come off of a shelf depends on who is going to be reading it or listening to it.     In my opinion, there is a fine line as to what can be considered too controversial or too mature. @CAPS1 is one reason why I think there should be censorship because some things are definitely too controversial or mature. Although, I also think there should be guidelines, and perhaps rules, on what should be allowed on shelves and what should not because some things might be on the edge of the line, but depending on what it is it can be, for example, a learning tool or great read.     As Katherine Paterson said, 'But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' @CAPS1 is why I think there should be guidelines or rules. If everyone had the right to remove something from a shelf, there might not be anything left to read or listen to. Different things are offensive to different people. If there were rules or guidelines, that would ensure there would still be things to read and listen to in the future.     I think there should be censorship in libraries. Some pieces of work are just too offensive, and they need to be taken off the shelves. I think it would be appropriate for some rules to be developed or some guidelines to be created. As Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.'",4,4
3814,I think that that if there is a book in the libraries that is hurmful. Then you should  have to be at least @NUM1 years of age to check it out. The reason why i say @NUM1 is because at that age you should know whats right or wrong AND you can handle it if is wrong. I mean if you know its wrong then dont read it no one is maken you read it.     It would be differnt if some one waz but no one is.Some people like to read differnt kinds of books just because its not right and hurts you dont mean it hurts ever one it @MONTH1 make it helpfull to some one esle and if its tgaken out then there wont be any books in the libraries for anyone to check out and read. BECAUSE ever book in there is going to hurt some if u made them read it.     If you have have a problem with that you can contact me at @NUM3 ask for @PERSON1 and we can talk bout it and mabe you @MONTH1 be about to change my mind or after you read this you make think the same way as i do.      The reason i feel thinks way is because like i said before there is a part in ever book that will hurt some one so you should have to be @NUM1 to check out surten books.If ur getting hurt by a bunch of books then i would sugest you to stop readen because a book is a book not somthing to hurt you.There is so many people in the world that is into books and resourcen bout stuff.     What i do not agree with is that kids getting out of class going to the library playing games and putting puzzels togther that is the problem  i got.I mean yeah people do go in there and do work witch is find BUT some say that they have work and they dont.They just want to get out of class and not do work. People go in there and play games and when people need on the cumputer there is no were to go because of kids playing games.          But as the book part in the library i dont have a problem with that  thats what i got to say bout books hurting people is dont read them other people  like them being there for them.,3,3
3076,"Yes, I believe that libraries should remove certain materials from the book shelves if they are found offensive to someone. First of all a oerson doesn't go to the library to get offended. Also if the liberian should know whats appropiate for the library. And items like the ones who offend people should not even be in a public area.     A person does't go to the library to see something that offends them. People go to the library to read, study and to have a quiet time. And the people that go to use the library for a resourse, should not find themselves in a situation were they feel that they are being offended by a book, movie or magazine, because of what the autor says in the writeing. People might get offended and stop going to the library.     Also the liberian is incharged of the items he wants to display in his library. If the liberian feel that a book its okay to be displayed he can dispay it, but if the book is offensive to someone else, he should be asked to remove the book. And if the book is resourceful for study the liberian should keep it in an area were people that want the book can ask for it.     Stuff like that should not even be published in a public area. I think that there should be a law that does not allow offencive literature, music, movies etc... In libraries. Now this days people are allowed to donate items of litereature or intertainment to libraries, but i think that people should make sure that the items they are donateing are okay to be displayed.     So yes I believe that offensive materials shoud be removed from the libraries. Because libraries are places were you go to have a quiet time to read and not to get offended. The librarian should be incharged of what he or she wants to dislay. Aand last stuff like that should not even be in a public area",3,3

3918,"When I was in fifth grade, chaos broke out in my community. Everyone-- teachers, students, parents, school board members, community leaders-- had something to say about the topic at hand. This topic was censorship. A high schooler's parents were outraged that their daughter had read The @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 in class. In these parents' opinion, the rape scene in the book was far too disturbing for their precious daughter. While this seemed a fair stance to take, the parents then took things a step further. They sought to ban the book in the schools in our township, wanting to spare all other children the experience of being exposed to @CAPS1 was clearly traumatic material.  This crusade of theirs posed the questions '@CAPS1 can and should be censored? And when?'.     As the debate continued, I myself begin to ponder the subject.  Who had the right to tell me @CAPS1 I could read? Or listen to? Or watch?  The answer I came to was 'no one'.  No one has the right to censor anyone else.  This comes with one exception: parents and children. Parents have the responsibility to monitor their children. They must use their best judgement to decide @CAPS1 their children are old enough and mature enough to hear, see, or read. This was true in the censorship of @ORGANIZATION1, as well. No one fought back against the family because they did not want their own child to read the novel; it was only once they tried to keep others from the book that the problem arose.     This is why libraries should not remove materials from their shelves because they are, in the eyes of some, offensive materials.  Music you love @MONTH1 be offensive to me.  Books your @CAPS2 teacher assigned @MONTH1 not be appropriate for five year olds. Your friends @MONTH1 be offended by your favorite movie or @CAPS3 show.  These feelings are subjective; almost nothing is universally offensive or universally appropriate.  We must, as a society, be able to accept this.     We learn throguh @CAPS1 we see, @CAPS1 we hear, and @CAPS1 we read. These experiences teach us @CAPS1 to do, as well as teach us @CAPS1 not to do. Because of this, it would be unfair for materials to be removed from libraries based on solely opinions. To do that would be to steal from community members their chance to learn.       Parents have the right to censor @CAPS1 their children see, hear, and read, but even this censorship must be done carefully in order to not hinder the child's ability to learn. We must not hinder our children's ability to learn from the mistakes of book and movie characters, singers, comedians, and artists.  If we do take away that ability, we are setting these future adults up for making mistakes that could have been prevented by allowing them the chance to learn.  Removing materials from the shelves of libraries based solely on opinions is not only damaging to our society, but, ultimately, it is dangerous to the people we wish to protect",4,5
4198,"Libraries across the world are facing the obstacle of censorship. Censorship has become a bigger deal in this day and age. @CAPS4 can effect books, music, movies, magazines, and many more. This posts the question is censorship a good thing or is @CAPS4 bad?      Censorship allows certain books to be removed from the shelves of a library if a certain person finds the book to be offensive. Everyone has there own opinion about things so why should that effect what we are allowed to learn? What one person finds offensive could be perfectly fine with everyone else. Plus you are not being forced to @CAPS3 something you @CAPS1'@CAPS2 want to. If you find @CAPS4 ofensive then one solution is very easy, @CAPS1'@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4!     Censorship not only effects the learner, @CAPS4 effects the writer. Censorship takes away the one thing a writer has, there freedom of speech. Writers create books, music, and magazine articles to voice there thoughts on topics, to show others how they see the world, and to show what might happened to them in their life. Because writers do this, @CAPS4 makes a connection with the reader that they can understand and relate too. Writers have a choice what they want to convey to the world and they should be given the privalge to do so.      Even if you are able to put a censorship on books and music at a library, you can'@CAPS2 censor the internet. The internet has become a place where anyone around the world can find websites that they like, where there are books, music, magazines, and even shopping stores. A library is a public library just like the internet is public too. Anyone should be able to acess @CAPS4 and enjoy what they like.      Putting censorship on things is almost equivilent to not letting a teacher teach because of there nationality or not letting our president give a speech because he is @CAPS5. Censorship is based on a opinion someone has. @CAPS4 shouldn'@CAPS2 effect the learners or the writers. Censorship holds back the voice of society and the thoughts of everyday people. Censorship should not even exist",4,4
3347,"Censorship in the world is getting worse everyday. Many people believe that some material is unsuitable. I believe that if it is unsuitable for others does not make it unsuitable for some. I believe people have the right to read,watch, or listen to what they want as long as it is not breaking any laws. I am torn on this topic because I am against censorship, but I am also for it when laws are being broken.     I believe that people should have the right to read whatever they want. Granted, some people read very incriminating books that could get them in a lot of trouble, but not everyone should be punished for another persons mistake. Sometimes you hear about terrorist groups and other illegal groups, but usually they do not market to everyday people. I think that when it becomes a threat to the @LOCATION1 they should remove material.     Another simple fact is that the constitution @LOCATION1 that we have the freedom of @CAPS1, which basically means we @MONTH1 print and read whatever we want. Many people depend on the constitution to make their lives seem safer and sometimes there is a book,article, movie, or a song that goes beyond our limits. I believe that some people use materials wrongly sometimes to get ahead and to make a name for themselves. I just think that people should write for the pure joy of it, not to persuade people to do something bad,or give bad thoughts or ideas.     The government has the right to control what we partake in, but does that seem fair? I understand thier logic behind this matter, but just because it has offensive matter does not mean they should remove it from society. I believe that if people want to experience it they should be able to without wondering if it will gone the next day. If people do not agree with this 'offensive' matter, then they should not take part in it. This is a true enough statement that it just makes you wonder about their logic.     So, does the government have the right to say what we can and cannot read? I don't believe so, but that is my opinion. I believe that people should read whatever they so choose to and should not think they are breaking laws for some 'offensive' material. Freedom of the @CAPS1 is what people have to look up to for the government, but how are people supposed to feel secure when they are reading a book, watching a movie, or listening to music that @MONTH1 be assumed 'offensive'.",4,4
3145,"Censorship in libraries is not necassary. No reading material should be taken off the shelf. Every book has a different experience that can help a child learn. If the gurdain of a child believes that a certain book is bad or offensive; then the gurdian can forbid the child to read it. If people began to take away options on reading materials some kids @MONTH1 refuse to read at all. Every person is different and likes an option to pick a book that they can get in to. Censoring books at a library is pointless, you take away options, and the experience to learn from certain books.     Every book has a different plot and a different moral. Each story in its own way teaches the reader a moral. When you start to remove books from libraries you are taking away the chance for a student to learn a certain moral from that book. You are sort of in a way trying to hide away reality when taking away certain books. No book should ever be taken off the shelves of libraries. Every book removed from the shelves  is another learning experience taken away.     If there is a book that a child's gurdian disapproves of; keep it up to them to forbid their child not to read it. A book is simply a way to learn and explore the different things in life. Censoring at the library can only keep kids away from the books for so long. Every child deserves the chance to read any book they wnat, unless a gurdian forbids. It is not up to libraries wether a book is offensive or bad. That is soley based on the readers opinion, and everyones opinion is different. So again, if a gurdian really wants their child to stay away from certain reading material they can forbid their child by theirselves.     When libraries begin to censor books they take away the option to pick books. When you limit the themes of books in your library, some kids @MONTH1 just pick up less and less books as time goes by. Everyone enjoys a differnet kind of book, leaving options open gives everyone the chance to find a book they like. Although some stories @MONTH1 seem like a bad option, it is not until the reader has begun to read that he or she can figure that out. Leaving options open for students is the best idea, because more kids @MONTH1 actually read.     All in all libraries should not censor books or any kind of reading material. Everyone is different even when it comes to reading a book. People like their options to be open and at a wide range. Each book tells a differnt story and teaches a different moral. So leave the options open to the children and let them learn from the stories they choose. Some books helps teach a moral or get a point acoss. Also some books help prepare a person for the outside world. Taking away certain reading materials is taking away the chance for a child to learn the things that are actually going on around them. In conclusion censorship is a bad idea and should be left to the gurdian of a child",4,4
4579,"Personally I believe that items that are found offensive should be left on the book shelves. People that find them offensive don't have to read them they can just ignore them and move on with their life.     Students @MONTH1 need to use that certain information in a classroom. If libraries take the information out of the library the students will not be able to find the info needed for their project or paper. Students will eventually learn all about these offensive magazines, movies, music, and books someday in their lifetime. If offensive books are taken down where else will they go, they are still going to be offensive somewhere else.     Libraries who have offensive books are not trying to offend anyone in anyway, they are on the shelves for the education of the reader or viewer. If movies are that offensive, don't rent them and save yourself and the libraries time. People get offended by all of these readings from a certain library, if the library chooses not to take the books off the shelves then go to a different library. Also the internet will more than likely have all of the information that is just as offensive.     Internet is a virtual library, you can search videos, books, magazines, and music. If people think they are getting rid of the offensive books, magazines, etc. They are wrong because the internet will hold that information for as long as it needs to. Library censorship is a pointless act due to the information provided on the internet. Libraries should be able to choose the books and information that they have in their building. As long as those books, music, magazines, movies, etc, are put in the right section.     The movies that parents don't want their children to see @MONTH1 be placed in the wrong section of the library. In that point of view you could see why parents are getting upset about inappropriate items on the shelves. The books should be divided so that children have their own section of the library and adults have their own section as well.     Most of these offensive items are not placed in libraries because of this problem with people being offended. Movies that are that offensive should probably be in a movie store that states that the movies are offensive and could be inappropriate. Maybe people over react to the situation and don't realize that the movie, book, etc, are not offensive enough to make an argument over it. I personally have never been to a library and saw a book, magazine, movie, song that was offensive to me or my family.     What does an offensive book look like? More than likely it has something to do with someone's religion, ethnicity, etc. Items are only offensive to certain people. If you or someone you know that is offended greatly by a book, song, magazine, or movie in a specific library don't go back or tell the person you know as well.     In conclusion if a book, movie, etc, is that offensive in a library near by, avoid that library and don't worry about going back. Offensive material could also be learning material",4,4
4138,"What would you say if your library  was censored? Would you believe it would be right to have a censorship at the library? Well I am here to explain my belief's on censorship in the library.     My opinion is that there should be some items being censored, but we dont want to punish everybody just by taking the books off of the shelf completely. If i was an adult I would not want my child renting very graphic books, magazines, etc. but i wouldn't want to block his whole life. There can be different censorship on individual people too. An idea is to have a parent come in to decide what type of censorship you can put on a child by putting this on his or her library card.      The censorship would be a great way to help parents watch what their children are reading and watching. A good suggestion for this is what i just brought up, a personal censorship. This would keep the child from reading too graphic of novels for their age and it would not offense the parents. Also for the rated x magazines, movies, etc. i believe they shouldn't be took off the shelf and just moved to a different area that is secluded. This can be offensive to parents when they bring their children in, so move it to a place where children cannot have access to this area.     The censorship on books can also be completely outrageous too. Alot of books have graphic parts in them but yet are also a great read and can have great morals to learn. Graphic parts of the books are like the graphic parts of our lives, it's going to happen no matter what and we can't get away from it. Let the child, teenager, or whoever it is read the book if they are mature enough to read this and don't take it off the shelf. Just because it is offensive to some, others want to read the book too. You @MONTH1 please some with this idea but you will also anger others with this action.     Another point to get across is the library is also censored a little bit too. The libraries are organized into section by categories of books. Some books are categorized by the age level they are intended for. Once you get into the actual novels it isnt much like this but for younger ages this is the case, which people can see it work as a censor in ways. When you become to the higher reading level, you are most likely going to be old and mature enough to pick what you think is right to read and what is not.      With all this being said, there really doesnt need much censorship in libraries. Unless you have the personal censorship on the younger ones. There is no need to punish the ones that did absolutely nothing wrong to the community and to others when all they want to do is to simply check out items at the library",4,4
3514,"The quote from the author Katherine Paterson is very true , I believe that if we were to remove everything in the world that we took offense to then there really wouldn't be anything left in the world to gaze upon.      I remember when I was younger and  I had just gotten off of school one evening and had decided to go downtown to our town's library , I needed a book for my school project on the holocaust and I remember one of the ladies working there telling me that the book should be removed from the shelves because it was offensive to jewish people. I had at first been a little bit outraged that she would tell the person checking out the book that it should be taken from the shelves mostly because since I'm the one going to read it why would you whine about it to me in the first place plus it's more offensive to tell the person that they shouldn't check out the book that they want to read then it is to the jewish.      Another time something like this occured was when I was in @ORGANIZATION1 and one of the customers was complaining about some religious magizine that they shouldn't be aloud to sell because some of the articles were very offensive to people of certain religions. The customer who complained was taken straight up to the managers office because he actually ripped a couple of the magazines in half , talk about having issues , anyway the customer was kicked out to say the least and had to pay for the magazines they'd destroyed as well.      There has been a lot of times in my life where someone has decided to speak out about their dislikes of something and although they put up a good argument they're lacking in a couple of important things , one of which is the fact that most of the things people complain that need to be taken from the shelves have something to do with history and another thing is there are not enough people complaining about it.      But the quote by Katherine Paterson is like a knock at the door , it speaks of what could happen if we removed everything from our shelves that are offensive to others and when I read that quote the first thing that pops into my head is another quote , ' @CAPS1 speak louder than words '",4,4
4368,I believe that the book that none of us read. It should not be on the shelf of any book store i think if the grow up does read it no child should have the right to. Also some of the music that is on shelf should be remove from all store. Children under the age of @NUM1 shouldnt have any way to get some of this rated r music centrain music shouldnt be on shelfs for little kids to get a hold to.           So now lets get to the movies that are playing in some of these shows. No child under @NUM1 should be able to see half of the things that are showing  and movies because no child should be expose to such things that grow up are most likely expose to. That is another way that young children are doing half of the things that they doing the peoples that make certain movies need to think about the children how they would act toward the ones they make.               Most magazines that are being sold today is giving children the wrong idea. When magazine are fill with alot of he say she say things the kids in the world do nothing but think its foreal or ok to do that is spent off the wrong message to the young children. And i know you are thinking to yourself like how is that true well kids these days listen to what ever they think is right and half of these magazines make things sound so real.,3,3
4339,Im against cencorship for good reasons. Everyone is for censor ship well im on a different perspective. if ur not old enough to get a movie or a book thats for a reason. On another note if you are then it shouldnt matter.     People should have their own choice. If they want to go out and get a rated @CAPS1 movie and watch it with their kids thats their own choice. Its defantly not the person who makes the movies choice to censor cusswords and stuff out. Thats why they make edited cds so people can by them instead.     People have different beliefs.  and its whatever they believe in is how it should go. and if somebody else with differant beliefs dont like that then i geuss they neede ta write @NUM1 paragrapgh like im doing now.     Also people want everthing cencored out. eventually theyre isn't going to be nothing to read watch or listen to. So all u people that want everything to be cencored I hope ur happy when the world has nothing to do because of you.,2,2
4041,"Books @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3      @CAPS4 your in a library its many book that children decide to read that @MONTH1 not be suited for their @CAPS3. Many parents allow their kids to read those type of books so they're use to it now. But some book aren't for children @CAPS3.     Now and days kids are more mature and knowledgeable and can read on higher levels. @CAPS4 kids go to the library they look for book that catch their attention. Some books that are out shouldn't be out and thats my opinion. Most authors write about things such as sex, drugs, and other bad thing. @CAPS4 a child looks at things like that they get ideas about what the book is talking about and try those things they read. Im not saying that all kids read books and decide to try all the things that they read, but most will.     Some kids minmic off certain things they hear, see and even read. Kids are always going to look up to other people so what they see you do they will try to do it. I beleive that things like books that kids should'nt read should be put away. Books should be taken off the shelves and put in places where only adults could get them. Just like video games only a certain age group could play the game because of the things they do in the game. The things kids see they soon try out. They should also make it where you rate a book like you rate movies, video games and other things. All books aren't bad for children @CAPS3 but some are.      I notice that many parents don't care about what their kids read as long as they're reading. People should'nt think that way  because its alot of crule people in this world. I even seen on the news where it was an author who wrote a book about how he killed a lady. So many teens read that book and found it interesting. And it even gave young boys ideas about killing people or girl friends. That book should be in the hands of someone with a mature mind that really knows right from wrong. Its parents out in this world that wouldn't allow their kids to read books that have bad things in them. Most parents find it offensive that book stores or other places sell these type of books to their children. The things authors talk about in their books and what they include no @CAPS5 should read.     Books that aren't good for certain age groups or that have inaproprate things in it should be removed from the shelves. But certain people interpret the words different and veiw it different. Its many books out in this world that most parents or grandparents hope their kids or grandkids never take off the shelf. But its going to keep going on until someone speaks up.",3,3
3286,"There are people out there that think somethings should be taken off the shelves or not even made. But thats their decision and not everyone should listen to it or just try to do it. I think things that are offensive should and shouldn't be taken off. They should because it might offend someone and it shouldn't beacuse then people can read or see it or even listen to it if its music and then know more about it and then they might not do the same things. So people do have a choice on what should be banned or not but they also have a choice on if they want to read it or not too. They might not want their kids to read it but their kids will still hear the same things somewhere else also.     I think they shouldn't be taken off because no matter what they do or what they say, stuff will still be out there in the world that people think are offensive and you just cant stop all of it. I listen to a lot of music when I drive to school and most of it is rap music. Yes, most of it is ofensive to girls and stuff but thats just music, it doesn't mean its true or anything. People have the choice to not listen to it or not read about it. If they think it is offensive to them or to anyone else or just not like it, they have thr right to just avoid it and not look at it. People want to just change everything and make sure things are perfect and nothing bad is in the world. But no matter what you try to do, something bad will be out there waiting for you. You just got to know how to avoid it. Avoiding things that you don't like would be a lot easier then just taking all the time you have to to try to get something banned off of a shelf. You should keep it on the shelf for the people who want to actually read it or just want to read it to see what its all about. When I read or listen to something thats offensive and I don't like it. I will just turn it off or not read it anymore. Not try to get it banned because that takes to much time. People should just not worry about what is being said or written and try to get it banned becuase another book will be out again and it will be the same.     So as you can see I think the material that is written should just stay as it is and people can have their choice on if they want to read it or not. If they do and they think its offensive then thats their fault for reading it when they know its gonna offend them. And for the people who don't read it, they are doing it because they know it will offend them. So not reading something that you don't like will be better in the end because then nothing will be banned and maybe nothing else will be made in the process of it being banned. So nothing should be banned and just keep it and everything will still be the same. We might not want our kids to read something bad but they will one day so why not just get it done and over with in the benginging.",3,3
3735,"Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves because little kids shouldn't be watching: seeing: or hearing them. Vielence is not a good thing for little kids to be watching because they will want to grow up and fight. We already have a high teen vielence rate. Our teen vielence rate really needs to be lowered. When teens start to fight they don't have control of themselves.      The movies in my oppion need to really be removed because that is how children are learning to fight. They see an older kid fighting and they want to try it out. Movies are a bad influnes on little kids when it comes to fighting and killing. Movies could also get kids to be bullies. When a kid is a bullie they don't really know what they are getting themselves into. Another bad example would be drugs and alchoale. Teens and other children get put into peer prushior. When teens and other children have peer prushior its hard to say NO.      The kinds of music people listen to. Music could also be a bad influence on kids. The music that kids listen to would have something about killing, drugs, and alchoale. When kids get involved in drugs and alchoale that will mess up their whole life. For example the screamo music to me sounds like someone would be killing or beating up someone.      Magazines are a bad thing for teens and children to be looking at and reading. Magazines have bad imangs in them and when teens see the imangs they want to act and or be just like the people that are in them pictures.      Books, movies, music and magazines should be removed from the shelves because of all the vielence. There are so many different fights and different teens that get other kids into peer prushior. That is why im persuativing you to take the books off the shelves",3,3
4158,"Do I believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No, it should not be removed. Katherine says, ' I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor.' @CAPS1 of all, she can have the right to do that but there is people who have a say in this. There are people who can read, listen, watch, and see what they like. Definately, I really think that it should not be removed even though it doesn't have positive things.     Although, it might offend some people they have a choice whether they should see, watch, listen, and read it. Many people might agree with the author about what she thinks about this. Though, many people might go against it. One reason why I think that people should be allowed to see, watch, listen, and read whatever they would like to see, it's because it's their own choice. We make our own decisions whether people like it or not. Another reason would be because people would want to see the funny things that people invent that actually make the shows. Some people do not like to be bored of the same thing.     Katherine Paterson the Author, is right in some ways. She wouldn't want her children to see things that are inappropriate. I have a daughter and I wouldn't want her to see things that are abhor. Last reason would be children should not allowed to see inappropriate things until they are eighteen or older. These things can influence children very intensely.     Indeed, many people in this world are influenced with bad things. The author stated, 'then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' Right, she is meaning that we have a choice of what our children would like to see. For example, there is a magazines full of negative words and full of horrid stuff. Would you pull it out of the shelf for your child to not have a chance to see that? You should if you love your child even though it's your own choice. You would want the best for you child to not see, read, watch, and listen to things that are inappropriate.     In conclusion, this would be your choice. There will always be things in the world that you don't like. You cannot stop the terrible things from happening. In the libraries there shouldn't be anything negative anyway because you never know what your child might be doing. Simply, teach your kid what is wrong and right. Finally, from what you experienced. Teach them the right things from the wrong things you learned so they wouldn't do the same mistake as you did.",4,4
4597,"BAD @CAPS1     Do you really want your kids to see bad immages or read bad prompts? I dident think so! you can help by teaching them what is right or wrong good or bad. You need to help them have a clere cnochience so when they come across these obsticalls in life they will know what to do.     You could do what my aunt @PERSON1 does. Whenever she goes through the check out ile at a local @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or other stores she turns the magazines that she thinks is innaproperate around. My mom and dad say this is a silent protest, because she is hurting no one else she just simply dosent like it.     It makes my dad upset when ever he watches tella vision with us and thier is some thing that they never saw on @CAPS4  like half naked girls on the comershals so he will turn the channel or shut it off. because he dosent want us exposed the bad thngs of the world.     My mom is the same way but she wont let us watch @NUM1 movies if i wanted to watch thies i was usually at my friends house. My mom would probably be a little upset. I think books are ok because you dont see alot of picture books you have to read them and imagine the image i their head.     In conclusion i hope you would feel the same way i do so next time you go through that check out stop and say to your self do i want little eyes to see this. Then you should turn that maggizne around turn off the @CAPS4 and the music,you should also ead the book so you know what it is  about",3,3
3643,"When u go places there will alway be something that one won't like not everyone likes everything. A library has to be the worst place for people not liking things. Censorship in libraies is getting worse and worse everyday, it is in everything in books, movies, music, and magazines. Should we keep things like this on shelfs? Everyone that will read this will think differently about censorship in libraries.     On the shelfs is lots of things with bad laugauge naughty pictures. These books little kids can pull off a shelf and see things that there parents dont want them to see. Censorship is everywhere not just in libraries. The books and things in the libraries need to be changed and not be so bad. If there is a need for things like this Then have a special store for things like this",2,2
3030,"Books, music, movies, magazines, and more are a good way to learn. Some of that material is bad though, but some is good. Not all people are the same, and not all books or magazines are the same.     Books, newspapers, and magazines are good things, and they could be bad things. Some talk about nonfiction and some fiction. Others talk about famous people and all the good and mainly bad things they did this week, which is something some of us want to read but none of us should read or even write in the first place. Then there are books that have a childs story in them. There are also articles that everyone should read about, like somebody who saved a whole lot of people on @DATE1. There is a diverse amount of things to read out there, you just need to use a little discretion about what to read and put out on the shelves at a public library.     Music is another good way to express yourself. There is good old fashioned @CAPS1 music such as @ORGANIZATION1. Then there is stuff that nobody should listen to, or for that matter even sing about like almost all @CAPS2 Music. They also have little childrens songs which no matter how annoying that most of it is, it's alright for anyone to listen to. Or you can pick up some good ol' @CAPS3 @CAPS4 or any other christian artists or gospel music.The music of this world is very diverse.     The movies of today can, but most of the time aren't,be  good things. You could pick up an educational video that talks about animals that most everyone could watch. There are also bad movies such as @CAPS5 and @CAPS6.It is a horror movie that made it hard to fall asleep for a few days. Those are some that nobody should even produce.There are video copies of television shows as well, which can be alright. The vast amount of movies made today should not even be a thought in someones mind but some are good and educational.     So in conclusion, I think it should be reader and viewer discretion when it comes to content of things as this. Libraries everywhere should have most everything there is.Next time your in a library, just use discretion",4,4
3353,"My thoughts on censorship in libraries is yes some books, music, movies, magazines, and etc., should be taken off of the shelves if they are offensive. If they are left on the shelves some very small child or teens could come up and reach for a book and find that it has bad things in it that are ment for adults. The child will ask the caregiver that they are with '@CAPS1 does this picture mean?', and they will most likely not know @CAPS1 to say at that moment. Parents and caregivers are not always up to explaining or want to explain as soon as they have to about things sometimes. Everyone goes through life with different things they have to learn at different rates. Somethings should be taught when we young like how to brush our teeth, but somethings should be left until we are older like having babies or drinking.           When parents going through the explaination of something like making babies you do not want it to be when they are only five years old. With books in a library with pictures of men and women questions like that do get asked to young. Libraries are public places and should be safe for any age no matter whether they are young babies or adults. Public schools have libraries in them also, and i would not want a child reading a @CAPS2 or @CAPS3 book with bad or offensive things in it. It does not just have to be a book with bad things in it, but it could also be something to do with religions. Everyone has their thoughts and comments on at least one religion. If you have grown up a @CAPS4 your whole life, and a kid picks up a book dealing with jews they will ask someone about it.      Young kids and teens can always find things that they should notat certain ages, but why not make it less by not letting a library be censorshiped? When you were younger your parent did not want to take you to the library and be asked an offensive question because of a book, music, movie, or magazine. It has worked for so many years, so we should not have to change it now.",2,3
4620,"I beleive censorship is a good thing; to an extent. I think that censorship deals with an age group and the permission of the parent(s) or guardian(s). If a consumer is the age of twelve and under; then the consumer should buy the censored books and etc., but, if you are thirteen and above you should be able to buy product uncensored.     Some people do not like censored products because they feel it takes away from that particular thing. Music, for example, alot of people get angry when the song lyrics on a @CAPS1 are censored. It does not allow the people to get the full effect of the music and the 'message' that the artist or band is sending.     With books; people get upset because they cannot get the full aspect of the book. Censoring a book is like taking away part of a masterpiece. Some books should be censored like alot of romance novels; those get pretty graphic and go into alot of detail with sexual themes and content. I do not think those books should be on the shelves.     In magazines; it depends on the type of magazine the consumer is reading. If a person is reading a politcal magazine; those magazines do not put all of the true facts and details into them for certain reasons. If a person is reading a hunting or fishing magazine; then they can put in all the facts on the guns, calls, lures, and stories they want and do not have to censor them.     Movies, on the other hand, are censored on certain channels. If you are watching a movie on a @CAPS2 network like @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS3; those channels censor movies. If you watch movies on @ORGANIZATION1 or @CAPS4 they do not censor the movies because those are movie channels only. That is also why movies have ratings. R is for restricted to people under seventeen (without an adult present) , @NUM1 is for people of the ages sixteen and under without an adult. and @CAPS5 and @CAPS6 are fine for any age group.     All in all; censorship depends on what age group the consumer is in really. If you are still in elementary school you probably should not be able to buy uncensored products; if you are thirteen to about fifteen, you should be able to buy the product with permission from an adult, and if you are sixteen and older you should be able to buy the products uncensored with out an adult present because you know you can handle the 'offensive' matierial",4,4
4095,"Reading is very important for kids these days. Libraries should have the right to have any kind of text, movie, magazine, or genre of music that is desired for a student to learn from. There are not any kind of books that could be deemed offensive in any way to people these days. There are exceptions to this however like any book written to specifically target a race, religion, or gender. Such as books written by raving racist fanatics like members of the @ORGANIZATION2 or @CAPS1-@CAPS2's.      Being a high school student and having a nice library in my school I have learned a lot from the books in my library. I have never in my @CAPS6 years of @CAPS4 seen a book or heard of someone who saw a book that offended them. I can assure you that there is not one book in the @CAPS7 that would offend me personally, this is not to say though that there are books out there that will offend certain people.     Reading books is fun to me and I would not want to miss out on a good book because a library is not holding it because there is the off chance that someone somewhere might get offended by that certain book. Reading should not be limitted based on content because there is always someone out there who is looking for that certain book for a good read. I have heard of people who have gotten mad because there was a nude picture in an art book. Seriously? An art book? Art is what it is. Art has had naked people in it for thousands of years. Why should it start to offend people now when it didnt offend people then? People are just weird in this day in age i guess.     There are certain movies that should most definately be removed from the shelves of libraries, such as porn for example. Porn should never, under no cercumstances be held in a library. There are special places for porn such as the internet. Music is a different story however. Music should not be taken out of libraries because there are some people who cannot affort to buy music for places like @LOCATION1, iTunes or @CAPS3. Music has so many genres that its is impossible to make out what should and shouldnt be in the library, and there are so many different types of people that listen to different types of music in the @CAPS7 and it would be wrong to tell that certain group of people that their music is too heavy or too rappy for the library. Listening to the music in the library is a different story however, you should definatly not be allowed to listen to your music in the library or at least not be allowed to have it loud enough for everyone else to hear it.     I dont read magazines but i know enough about them to know that they should and shouldnt be allowed into a library. Magazines like '@CAPS4' and '@ORGANIZATION1' should definatly be allowed into a library because they are the hub of learning from magazines. However there are magazines that should not be allowed into a library like '@CAPS5' and other pornographic magazines as well as ones like '@CAPS6' which are magazines that target young girls to make them think that they should look perfect like the models in the pictures. Those are the types of magazines that make young girls dress skimpy and inapproprietly and make girls turn to throwing up to keep themselves skinny.     There are definatly some things that should be kept out of the libraries but one book, or one movie, or one genre of music, or one kind of magazine should not keep them all out. One problem shouldnt make them all a problem. Libraries are a place where people go to escape, similar to things like @CAPS7 of @CAPS8 and other videogames. People should have the right to go to a labrary with the intent of getting something and they should be able to get what they came for.",4,5
3007,"I don't believe that certain books, music, magzines, or movies should be removed. If they are found offensive then that is not my problem. If they offend me then oh well that is my issue to deal with. When it comes to any of the mentioned items, sooner or later society will find them again and they will be back on the shelves.     No matter how offensive they are curiosity will bring them back on the shelves. If a book id found offensive by one person or group of people that doesnt mean it should be removed off of the shelves. That is a problem that the one person or group of people will have to live with.      Anything and everything is educational in it's own way. Even if it is offensive it can teach someone wrong from right. That being said is it wrong or right for someone to want something offensive to removed from the shelves? It depends on a persons personal views or beliefs. Whether they like it or not things are offensive to somebody out there and there is nothing we can do out there to change that.     It's sad to admit, but there really isn't anything to change that. It's just easier to live with it. Maybe whatever you found offensive wasn't meant to be offensive. It depends on what you take offence to. Maybe the writer, director, or composer meant for something to be offensive, maybe they didn't. It's all based on how you take what they said into thought. So when it boils down to it nothing should be removed from the shelves. For if one thing must be removed then youi might as well remove everything.",3,3
4518,"libraries arcross the world contain all kinds of books, so good and some bad. theres always gonna be something in a book that @MONTH1 offend the reader or someone close to the reader. it just depends how sensitive people are. the main reason people want to ban books or have them removed from libraries is because of racial slurs, relgion, and sexual content.       i think it should be the libraries choice to either put the book on the shelf or to take it down. magazines are an issue along with movies and different kinds of music. according to some libraries are just trashed with vulgar, racial, or bad movies, books, ect. if the parents are scared of there children being able to rent these things, they need to put some sort of block on them. if you want to rent bad things you should have to have parental permition.      taking all of these things out of the library is not a soulution. all it does is create anger and leads to lawsuits and more. the library needs to make sections of different rated books so that kids wont be able to get the 'bad' books in there hands.alot of the nooks in libraries have meaning even if the book uses foul language or hate etc. it shows the mood of the story or how the charachter really feels inside. if stories like '@CAPS1 in The @CAPS2' didnt have anger, emotion, or the passion it has it would be a boring book. authors put language, sexual content, and violence in books, movies, and magazines to entertain certain crowds. if you take these things away certain people will not have the entertainment they have enjoyed with the things they have read or things could possibly read",3,3
4312,"Do you believe that if you just take a book off a shelf you or your kids won't be exposed to offensive material?  If you do, then you are wrong.  You can't isolate your family or other families from the world because you are scared that they might pick up something bad.  Everyday, whether they read a book or not they are still exposed to vulger behavior.       'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right ot remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us.' @CAPS1 quote by Katherine Paterson also helps understand the concept. If someone were to take a book off of a shelf at their home, a public library, or maybe even a store that they found offensive at any point in the book, then there would be no books left for children and even adults to read.  In every book there is some form of material that people @MONTH1 not be a fan of.  There would soon be nothing left.      There isn't a day that goes by that a kid doesn't hear something offensive.  Even at school, where it's supervised, children bring words that they have heard their parents say or things that they have seen their parents do, and they share them with other kids.  You can't protect them from every small encounter they are faced with.      Some books are by far more offensive than others, but are you going to give a kid a book that has vulgar language or, will you give a child a book that's about @CAPS2 the @CAPS3 running out of honey in his jar?  Most children don't go to a library or a store without super vision if their parent is @CAPS1 careful about just books.  Therefore, their parents probably aren't going to allow them to pick up a obscene book or magazine, and in fact they would probably try to hide it from them.     If a book is put on a shelf then it is there for those who enjoy that material.  If you can't make the world kid safe, then why would you try to make a library the same exact way.  There are other people out there that might find the very material that you that is offensive fascinating, and a library is there to suit everyone's needs.  It isn't there for just children.",4,4
4338,"The Author Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does anyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I do believe certain materials, such as music, books, and movies shouldn't be on a  childrens shelf  to read, but rather on an adult shelf .     I believe every author has his or her right to express ones self and to be accepted for that. We all have our own beliefs and standards that we would like others to respect even if we dont agree on there beliefs. If  every book that was found offensive was taken of  a shelf we would soon have no books left. The reason for that is because everyone finds certain thing offensive.     Many children are intersted in certain thing and we cant hold them back from that unless it is inappropriate or goes againts family morals or valus such a religous beliefs. It would be a good thing to monater what your children are reading, wacthing and listening to.     On the other hand adult shelfs will have many diffrent things that would be offensive to many diffrent people unlike childrens books. Writing is a way to show a persons expressions and what they stand for although it @MONTH1 not be pleasing to me or any other person.      But what if we write a book and sombody does not like it then we wouldnt like it if they took it off the shelf. that would show direpect to a person who has thought long and hard on there work. Learn to stand proud on what you believe. Learn also to respect others as well and to let children be around safe family type of books, music and magazines",3,3
3794,"Do I believe that certain materials should be taken off book sheleves if found offensive? There are many answers to this question and many people have different views to the question. For instance, you have to look at all of the different races, customs, and more of what people believe in to find the true answer. Some materials are very offensive, but should they be taken off the shelves of our very own libraries?     There are thousands of books in a library, and hundreds are written every single year. These books range from romance, action packed, and scary. Now many books are starting to be found offensive to our society today. I have read many books and have not found hardly any book to ever be offensive. There are offensive things in other matierals such as: music, movies, and magazines.      I do recall listening to music, watching movies and reading magazines and not liking what i was doing at all. Some music today is just extremely bad. From the fowl language and missinterpretation of words, music has become worse. Some movies that I have watched are not very well either. Movies can be offensive in many other ways than any other material there is. You got the scary, gorry and the movies with all of the different sex scenes that are made every year. This can teach the younger kids what is wrong and right, as well let them be aware of what life is about.     I do believe that all of these materials should stay on the shelves of our libraries. Learning from books, music, movies, and magazines is good in a way. Knowing that many things in this world today are offensive to people, I think that it can only make our society stronger to help us understand all of the different views that our people have. Yes it can go in bad directions, but there are many ways to get people to understand what is right and what is wrong to push them to stride for the best.      Knowing that materials on our shelves are offensive, I still believe that the right thing to do is to keep them there. Clearly people get mad and upset when reading, listening, or watching these materials, but this is what makes us who we are. There will always be offensive stuff being said written and so on, but the way you can handle it yourself will show everyone around you that it is possible to change their own views of the offensive matter and look at it the better way.",3,4
4742,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1     @CAPS2 my name is @PERSON1 and I am a student that attends @ORGANIZATION1. I go to libraries quit often, and things that I see in there I feel souldnt be in there. Like the movies. Theyre okay, but theyre all sitting together. So that means me bein a young lady. I see things that I know my mother wouldnt approve of me even looking at. They have censored movies just sitting there.     I even go through the shelfves sometimes and see the type of books that my mother wouldnt even look at. They have censored books in the libraries just sitting there like its a book about @CAPS3 or something. I have conversations with some of the workers sometimes, and they dont see anything wrong with little kids or teenagers looking at censored things. Not all of them think that way though. I dont think or feel that it should be censored books in the library and children aare able to look at them. Thats not right at all.     Far as the music i agree with music at libraries, because many people listen to different type of music. As long as the music is something positive, but there are all kinds. You just have to be careful what music you listen to at a library because there are young people everywhere. There are children around the age of @NUM1 in there, and younger too. They wouldnt know how to respond to a song thats talking about killing people or shooting them somewhere. Then you never know what there parents wanted them to know at a young age like that. I dont feel that real nasty and bad music should be played at @CAPS4 Libraries.         I dont believe censored magazines should be in there either. I really believe that magazines are one the main censored things in the library. There are many of them books also. They shouldnt be there at all just for the sake of the children and parents.They dont need to grow up fast they need to enjoy there life while they are young. And by looking at the censored things thats not helping at all.      Inconclusion, I really think something needs to be done about all of these censored things. Many people complain to the @CAPS1 when they come in the @CAPS4 Libraries. What im just askin you for is that you please help our @CAPS4 Libraries get those nasty things out of there. They can even make there own side of the Libraries with just censored things for adults only. I know that this is the right thing and i kno many people agree with me. People only want the best for their children and a library with alot of censored things in there doesnt sound like the best. That just mean they are startin off wrong.                                              Sincerly: A student who believes in changes",4,4
3489,"Do you believe everyone should have their on beliefs? Do you believe everyone should express themselves through their own culture, or have their own opinions? Where's that one place where you can experience all of those? In a library no one can judge you for your beliefs, culture, or opinions. In a library you have the right to have an open mind.     I believe that any kinds of books, music, movies, magazines, or any other material should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Everyone is different and has their own beliefs and understandings. For example, if someone were to go to the library and purchase a book about the famous and deceased @PERSON1, and the other person did not like @PERSON1 and did not understand his cultural background they would take it offensive to come across that book on the shelf. If everyone had a say on what books or other materials were put on the shelves of libraries, we wouldn't have any libraries.      If everyone kept their opinions to themselves in libraries everyone could possibly remain happy and have no arguements. Everyone could express themselves everyday, in their own way",3,3
3975,"I do believe that libraries should censor certain materials. Some things like music and magazines have bad language and racey pictures in them. Some parents might not want there kids to be exposed to this. Some parents might not know what their child is looking at in the library and wants them to be safer. The easiest way to prevent children from listening to innappropiate music or looking at offensive books is to take them off the shelves.     Some children go to the library without adult supervision and have freedom to check out whatever book they want. The child could easily pick out an innopropiate book and read it because there is no parent there to guide them. There is nobody to tell them what is wrong and right so some kids might not know. Thats why some books and music should be removed.      If you do not remove innappropiate books and music from the shelves you would have to have an attendent. The attendent would have to walk and around and check out what each individual kid is doing. It would be a lot of busy work and the libriarians are aready busy enough. Nobody really wants to do that so the simplier solution is to just remove the books and music from the shelves.      Another opition if you do want to keep the music and books on the shelves is to have an age limit on the books and music to check them out. If this were done it would still lead to problems like kids reading the books at the library but never checking hem out. This is an easy way to get around the system. A child could easily ask an older friend to check the book out for them, so they could read it later. This is another example of how easy it would be to get around that system.      Therefore, the easiest way to aviod problems with books and music is to remove them from the shelves. If this were done it is harder for the children to get the innopropriate books and music. If somebody needed to check out an innappropiate book for any reason, they could go someplace else. This is the best and most efficient way to protect and keep everyone safe",4,4
3122,"Why @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     Is there movies, music, magazines, books, and more in our libraries today seen as offensive to some? A good portion of people believe so, and there is some that @CAPS2 doesn't even concern. So should they be removed from the shelves of our public libraries or should they be able to stay? Katherine Paterson made a statement and a part out of @CAPS2 said ' But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf that work that I abhor then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     @CAPS3, I believe that some of the literature and magazines should be taken out of the libraries just because of the content many books are loaded with foul language, violence, sex appeal, ect. For example I can recall a day I went to a local library with my little sister, and she was looking for a disney magazine and there were provocative magazines on the shelf that had half naked women on the cover right next to the kids magazines. To me this is an image of selling sex. What parent would want there child learning about sex at a young age?      Next, even the music today placed in libraries is not good clean music. A lot of the music today is also sellling sex, violence, and drugs. My father tells me all the time till this very day that music back in the day was appropriate for all ages. Music such as hip hop, and rap, is the main source for all the inappropriate stuff, but the rappers and producers are not to blame causse they are only creatimg what people want and what is selling.     Also, the movies rented out of the libraries today are very offensive. They seem to contain the same material as the books, magazines, and music.They all portray the same image that seems to be entertaining to majority of the society today. So can we just find something better to catch the attention of the audience who buy this material?      In conclusion, I do believe that this material should be taken off the shelves of public libraries. But I dont think @CAPS2 would do any good, cause people will just find another source to get @CAPS2. Like Katherine said @CAPS2 won't be any books left if its all taken off",4,3
3946,"When going to a library you expect to see various books, movies, music, magazines, and maybe other items. If a person is looking for a book that maybe could be offensive to a race, culture, religion, or etc., they should still be able to check out that book. Libraries shouldnt be able to control those situtations, because it's a persons choice or adults choice to read those kinds of stories.     In our country we are allowed to express our opinion by the @CAPS1. The @CAPS1 includes free speech which insures that anyone can express their personal feelings or their opinion on certain matters. If a person would want to check out a book that could offended another individual technically by the law they have the right to do so. I'm not condoning that someone should read books, listen to music, or even watch movies that could be hateful or cruel, but by the law its ok for people to want to read, listen, or watch those works.      Libraries are government funded organizations. Therefore meaning they dont have the right to disregard these works. The government pays for the books that are purchased into the library. This means they need books that people would want to read, and be interested in even though some gruops of people might not agree its there job.      I'm not encouraging reading these novels or listening to offensive music, but as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we are allowed to listen to what we want, and read anything we want, because thats what our country is meant to stand for freedom. When I think of @LOCATION2 i think freedom, and i have to say I'm proud our country stands for that, and we should  stand for that freedom even when it comes to the small things in life",4,4
4225,"I believe that the books, music, movies, magazines should be removed if they are really offensive. Just because it's offensive to one person doesn't mean that it would be to another person. Any movie you watch could be offensive to one person or two but, not everyone. So I would say no to taking the offensive things off the shelfs because, who is really going to be offened by and are they really offened by this matter or aspect.      Also, I believe that some people might lie about if they are offened by it just so that they will take it off the self. Maybe, there is a movie for example, that there is a lot of bad words, I could see them being able to take that off the self because, a lot of people don't like those words to be used and thats understandable. If they are just taking it off the self tho for one little thing I don't think that should be aloud.     I think that if that person is getting offened by what a book said or a movie said then don't read it or don't watch it. No body is forcing you to watch or read a book that you don't want to. Reading and watching a certain movie is all up to you not what others say.      I believe that this really has to go down to what the persons beliefs are. Maybe they go to church every day which means that they probably aren't going to be watching the movie ' @CAPS1 @CAPS2.'  They are going to pick a movie more suitiable to their life style and what their use to. Maybe they had a friend that suggested that they should watch a movie and they did, they might have taking offensivness to that, but that was also there choice they didn't have to watch it.      If this was the case to take a book, movie, music out because someone was offened then there would be nothing left. Are you saying that you would listen to everyone if they came in to get a book and then came back and said ' this book offened me, I want you to take it off the self.' I'm sorry but, I'm having a hard time believing that your going to listen to every single person that comes in a says that. Also, @CAPS3 do you know it was offensive to them are you going to have them show you what was the problem with this book? My guess is no because you don't want to deal with that many people about one or two maybe even five books.     I'm not saying that people don't get offened by somethings that books and movies say but, your going to have a lot more then just one person come in and say that there are more then just one book or movie. so then there would be no books left. What if you have someone come in and they request that they have a certain movie and you say ' @CAPS4, I'm sorry we had to take that movie off the self because, it offened someone.' I have a feeling that person is not going to be happy and you will have some explaining to do.     Also, what if a person comes in and asks for something and you tell them that you had to take it down and they say that it was a very nice movie are you going to listen to them also if you listen to one person don't you think that its fair if you listen to the other person also that likes the movie. I am a person that believes theres two parts to every story. So, therefore, I think that you should listen to both sides or keep what you have if that person wants to take it off the self then do it but, if someone asks for that specific one then I would let them have it because that isn't going to hurt the person that got offened by the book or movie is it.     Therefore, I think that they should keep the books, movies and music all on the seleves unless more then one person complains then it would be a different story.",3,4
3801,"There are some certain materials i think is affensive to childrens is book,music,movies an even magazines.Books have a lot of materials unsafe for children because they can get a hold to @CAPS1 books and other unsafe materials.Another thing is music, and even music videos has a lot of profanity in them.Movies such as @CAPS1 movies some children @MONTH1 watch them and reflect wat they have watched on tv.The next thing is magazines,has material such as appropreate pictures in them tats why they should take the books,music,movies and magazines off the shelf.",2,2
4492,"Every we go there is censorship. Childrean hear their parents saying them and are more than likely to repeat them. Children should know what cursing is and know it is not right to do. It should be up to the children what they read.       Books should be censored if they are made for children. Adults should have the option of reading any type of book they would like. Children who have been secluded should learn that curse words are a part of reality also. We can learn something from any thing we read.     There are a lot of facts teachers do not teach that books can. When uncensensored things are said aloud children are estatic. If they read themselves they would learn alot more. If your parents do not inform you either, you can miss out on some of the most important facts of life.      It is very unnecessary to have rated @CAPS1 movies.Parents should be able to watch a mature movie with their children without being on the watch for something they do not want their child to see. The choice of children watching censory movies should definitely be on the parent.     I always think it is a bad idea to have derrogatory pictures on magazines. These photos @MONTH1 give children negative thought, such as insecurity of wishing they looked better than the model. Children remember almost everthing they hear/see. It should be up to the children what they read.",3,3
3441,"The library has many books, they would have anything that you could possibly imagine.The library is a great resource for any information. They have so much information that if you were to go to the library, you would be there all day. Libraries carry many different kinds of books. They would probably even carry a book perhaps on hats. There are libraries all around us and are very convienent.     If a library carried misleading books, music, movies, or even magazines, I would have to say that they could get in a lot of trouble, especially if a magazine or a movie or any other source of information, would show anything that would affend someone in any way, then someone should tell the librarian or the manager and say this should not be on the shelf. When people go to the library they are exspecting clean reviews about the library.             If a library were ment to carry offensive products it would not be called the library. The library is ment to be a quiet place where someone could go there and browse around maybe, or just go in and get what they need and come right on out . Most libraries are pretty peticular of what they should or should not put out on there shelves. If someone put something way out of the ordinary, and that person knows that they should not put the book on the shelf they should automatically be fired.       In conclusion libraries are very nifty and important to the town or city. The only thing would be is to keep an eye out for any offensive books, music, and etc. You never know when they will be randomly out on the shelf, and if you happen to find one you should imediently tell the librarian or the libraries manager. The library @MONTH1 get in trouble and then again they @MONTH1 not",2,3
3848,"Katherine Paterson wrote, ''If I had the right to remove that book from the shelf that work I abhor~~ then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.'' quote.Having the right to do something is a part of freedom of speech almost. Its believing in your decesion or choice you have made. If I were to reflect my views on censorship in libraries, we all would have that same oppurtunity to state our opinion about what we feel should not be included. There could be unappropriate books in the library that we absolutly would not want our younger group of siblings reading. The best thing is to ask ourselves, Should we have the right to take our kids freedom an right to read, listen to, updated media and publications from them when we had it? Should we put a censorship on the libraries really?     I feel that censoring a library would not be nessarry considering a library is a manual guide of history. Our libraries or organized from A to @CAPS1  in authors names, seperated from non fiction an fiction, cd's seperated in one section, movies one section, magazines, and adult books from children book seperated in diffrent sections. Libraries all across the world has had a kid that might have choose a book that was not appropriate for them to read but what kid hasn't. What would a book hurt them if theres plenty of  bad influces, peer presure, violence, and sexually publicity everywhere and @PERCENT1 in the media. It would not be fair at all for us to rob our kids of the chance to read and learn from books.     I feel no we should not take our learning form our babies. Growing up as a kid I loved being able to go to the library it helped to enhance my vocabulary, spelling and which I learned plenty new words. Books I read growing up wasn't perfectly @NUM1 but I could relate to alot of books I choose as a kid so no I feel we should not censor libraies we need them to be a fun place to our children and us to go to for learning, fun, confort and etc. We can't take that from our generation it just would not be right.",4,3
3193,"Certain people beleive that offensive books, magazines, or music should be taken off of the shelves of libraries. I think that offensive books and music and media should not be taken off of the shelves. It is a persons own right to see certain things that are offensive if they choose to do so. It is also not another persons right to decide what other people can and cannot observe. If certain offensive things were taken off of the shelves of libraries such as music, books etc. the knowledge of people would be limited to only what the library or the government would want them to know and that is not right.     It is someones personal decision wether or not they look at listen to or read offensive things. People shouldn't be sheltered by society and only know what is wanted for them to know. If libraries eliminated offensive media then people would be able to form their own oppinions and ideas. In some cases reading and knowing certain things that are offensive to some people should be known to the world. One case is how people should know about the holocaust in the @DATE1. Im shure reading about the holocaust is very affensive to copius amounts of people, but even though this history is disturbing and offensive people should know about it so that history does not repeat itself.      The government and society does not have the right to decide what people take in. For example what if all of a certain type of music was eliminated from libraries, the internet, and tv; it would slowly dissolve out of  existence. Certain things like reading about the times before racial equality, and such things as slavery are very offensive for people to read about. But these things must be read and heard and passed down through history so it isn't forgotten.      The knowledge of offensive things should not be taken away from people by the libraries. Yes offensive things shouldnt be celebrated or looked upon as good but people should know. People in the world cant just know the good things or only what their society wants them to know, they also have to know about the bad things and offensive things that happen and have happened as well.",3,3
3892,"Here in @LOCATION1, it is in our constitution that says anyone can have freedom of speech. Freedom to say anything they wish to get off their mind and express individuality and opinions. This should also include books, music, movies, magazines, and any other form of entertainment. However, there will always be people that could take offense to others' ideas and opinions that comes with freedom of speech.     In a case where someone was to find a certain type of material to be offensive at a public library, then it should be known that he or she should not observe the type of material given. He or she should not throw a tantrum over something that they find offensive while other people find very enjoyable. It is in that person's standpoint that they should realize and come to grips with freedom of speech. What they @MONTH1 not like could very be what others do like.     So, why should other peoples' form of enjoyment be censored and taken away from them just because of one bad lemon? It shouldn't. Everyone expresses themselves in their own way. It's a form of getting positive and/or negative energy out in a healthy way. Whether it's writing books, posting articles, or writing music, it's a way to vent and some people @MONTH1 like that venting person's style. It is completely up to that person who takes offense to materials on whether or not to observe such style.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. If there was a type of censorship, it would be taking away what some person would like to enjoy. It would also be taking away the artists' or authors' freedom of speech and expression. There are books that were banned from schools throughout the country. Just because they think is right doesn't always mean it is right. Sure, they just want the people protected from certain offensive stuff. but why keep them from the real world? Let people out to see what this world is like and it's various types of art.",3,3
4156,"I think other materials in libraries such as music and art should stay active in public libraries or school libraries. They show symbolic meaning to the ever changing world as we know it. People have different beliefs about anything, I don't care what you say everybody still has a different opinion about anything and everything. So just keep believing what you want to believe that's fine, but don't ruin it for others, you ever heard the saying, '' if you don't have anything nice to say then don't say anything at all'', well they should remember that saying and stick to it.In my years of being in school nobody has protested about certain reading materials in public libraries because everyone read what they liked because the library supplied people with the material they wanted to read. Let's say a person wanted to read a book about the fall of the wall of @LOCATION1, the library says they do not and will not carry such reading history, the person will be angry even though they can find the book somewhere else but they should still be able to find that book in that library. That is history in this world and they should know it. That compares with people wanting to destroy history made in this world, history people risk there lives for to be recognized in this world, this compares with the topic fully. I hope that this essay will give the protesters a second thought on the topic they are bickering about. That will be all",3,3

I think people take stuff like that to serious, if they dont like it I think they should just leave it alone.What some people might find offensive others will find interesting. There is alot of stuff out there that might be a little offensive to some people, but if they dont like it all they have to do is put it up and go on with there life like its no big deal.     In the past there has been some movies that make fun of people for the way they act or just something they did in the past. Stuff like that I can understand because that can be personal reasons. There has also been times when I have seen people make a big deal over nothing.Sometimes people say stuff and the person reading it can take it a whole different way.There is still alot of people taking books off the shelf because of someone complains about the language in it or maybe making fun of another race.     I think the worst thing today is magazines because they are always judging people about who they are with, what they did @TIME1, or even who has the best body and who has the worse body.I think people should just stop worrying about everybody else so much and just worry about theirself and we wouldnt have so many problems.",3,3
3558,"Do you think books, music, movies or anything else that could have something offensive be removed from the shelves from our libraries? Well this is what im going to talk about in my essay.     I do not think that certain materials should be removed from the shelves. The reason is, is because just because you don't like something that one book might have in it dosen't mean that another person won't. Also, some book that have offensive things in them can help you realize the consequenses that could happen of it could reinform you about those kind of things. Also if you think the reading material is going to be something you wouldn't read or you think is not appropriate then just don't read it, it saves it so when someone else that actually wants to read something like that then let them.      Sometimes i will go to the library to find a book that i saw somewhere in a different store and they wouldn't have it, so i would ask about it and they said that if they didn't have it there then it must something in it that could be offensive to others. But i know that alot of people like those nasty gross books and some don't. People have different opinons about things, so just because the person that is aloud to take the books of the shelve or put them on don't like the book or thinks its not appropriate dosn't mean that someone else will not like it either.      Well, here is what i think of certain books or anything else that contains reading that are being taking off the shelves. I hope it makes people realize that they do like other things than you so leave the offensive readings out so people can learn that if they don't like it then don't read it",3,3
4297,"Libraries     Do you go to libraries? Many people all over go to libraries for many different reasons. Sometimes when you go there, you have to have a reason to be there. You also have to be very quite. Libraries are very interesting in many ways.     Some @MONTH1 ask what a library is, well they are good places to go. People can go there for many different things. Most of the time, when people go to a library, they go to get books. Not only can you get books from there, but also go there for school tutouring, for a place to read, and just to go somewhere quite. See libraries have many things to do.     Why do people go to libraries? Well I personally do not go to a library but many others do. People that like to read go there to get a kind of book they want. I would go there for totouring for school, I honestly need it. It helps you alot and gets your homework done. My mother goes there on some occasions, like, to get information from a book or a computer. They have alot of information they you can look for. Then there are online geeks, who like to get online for video games. I get on the internet but not for video games. There is another reason why people go to the library.     My little sister loves going to the library. She is only eight years old. Why am I telling you this? Well when you go into a library, you can not get a book if you are under age. In that case, you have to have parents permission to be able to get one, but not only that, you have to have a library card in order to get a book. I no, stupid rules right? SO then again you have to have parents permission for that to! Well after the permission is all said and done, when you go to get a book, you have to make sure it's you own grade level. I have to watch that with my sister all the time because if not, then they will yell at you. I personally think that is good for most kids. So now you know that libraries are very strict.          Now that I told you all about libraries, I hope you learned something from it. Remember that they are very good places to go to for information, to get books, or just to go somewhere quite. You can always find a library around, there are NO @CAPS1! Well if you don't like to read or be quite, then you shouldn't go. I'm going to leave that to yourself.",3,3
4067,"If we remove all books we think should't be on the shelves. What would there be to read? So many books have great detail in them to give us a vivid picture about what we're reading. Even at times the books we think are alright to read end up having a surprise that no one saw coming. I don't think we should have to remove books, music, movies etc., just because they are found offensive to some people. Instead of removing the books others love to read, what we should do is rate the books like we do movies and music. Or put the books some people find offensive in there own area.      If all books were rated like movies, we would know just what were buying or checking out. Movies are rated by the language and content they have in it. Books should be the same way. Or if someone was to find a book or magazine offensive they should be put in a different location with a labe identifing that they could be offenisve to others. I do not think they should just be removed and out of the way.      I think having books that are too offensive should be put in there own bookshelves. By doing this, people would know not to let there childeren go near them because they have been labled. And like rated '@CAPS1' movies a minor needs to be with an adut. But with books you should be find with your own choice at the age of @NUM1.      In my opinion this would be a great idea to be done and should be done. There's a bunch of books i can think of that would not be suitable for young childeren. Yet little kids love to read and could easily take a book off the shelf if they so pleased.          Many parents complain about what thier childeren read, watch, or listen to everyday. Labing would be such a great way to control a bit of what they hear and see each day. I think many parents would agree with my opinion and stand by it. I'm not saying to throw away the offensive books, music, movies, etc., but to labe them so others know what they are going to read or see. I believe this would be an excellent way to make sure our childeren don't read the things we as parents wouldn't want them to read or check out",4,4
3997,"If content in a library is considered offensive, @CAPS1 should still remain on the shelf regardless.

Taking one kids cake because @CAPS1 has to much frosting would anger most kids (and adults).If a book, album, movie or a magazine is known to contain offensive or inappropriate material @CAPS1 should remain organized with the rest of @CAPS1's kind, not exiled in the furthest corner. When one checks out such media @CAPS1 they should be required to state they are comfortable with the fact that their media might contain inappropiate and/or offensive content.I personally find @CAPS2 @CAPS3 or in the context of a song, @ORGANIZATION1 fascinating. Every time i look up these poems i have to accept an agreement that I am comfortable with @CAPS1's violent or hateful content. Although, I do agree @CAPS1 should not be readily available to anyone looking for something new to read(or listen) without their consent.I believe that simply asking the costumer if they are comfortable with a form of media's content would prove suffice. No one wants to settle for less or no frosting, and they should not have to.",3,3
4191,I think all books and other stuff should stay on the shelfs. Because other people should have the right to learn about something if you have already learned it.  Censorship is kind of out of the way.  I think it really doesnt matter if they see it now or later because they are still going to see it and learn about it later on in life. If someone wants to read it I think they have right to because it is their own choice.  I have been observing students and adults in the libaries and every where they think they can run everything.  But this is what I think is right,2,2
4106,"Read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 ?     Books, music, and movies all have a meaning and a purpose to them. In our spare time, we all enjoy to read, @CAPS1, and @CAPS2 the things that let us do so. These things keeps us all occupied when theres alot of time to spare. The library is a place where you can go read in peace and @CAPS1 to music with no distractions or anything, but there are somethings that are not cut out for the library.          People find books at the library that they find very interesting and decides to check them out, but little do they know what the book and/or magazine has in it. Books come in all different genres and so do music and movies. And we all have our own views in what type of genre we enjoy listening, reading or watching.           Genre comes in all kind of different types. For example, theres only one certain type of book for a child and which at the library should be picked out for a child to read and a child only. Theres also books for grown adults and adults only and once checked out, it should be kept from a childs hand or vision. Because children could see the wrong things and things might get out of hand.     All readings, music, or movies that have explicit or uncensored graphics or words should personally have their own section in the library. In this case, nothing bad could happen and everything is in place with everything else. Honestly all media actually should have their own section. For example, all kids media should be in one section and all adult media should be in another section.          All books should be left on the shelves of every library, only because one knows what should be read and what shouldn't be read. A kids desired book is a childrens book with color and picture while on the other hand, an adult has their own type of selection. So books should stay where they belong and not tooken down from any self, that also goes for, movies, music, or any other media",3,3
4548,"No,I dont think that certain books,music,movies,maganzines should be taken off the shefls.If stuff like that gets taken off then there will be nothing good to read the book now day a starting to get good so if they take the good book then no one will read.Most people think that rap music is bad but that is the music that most people listen to now day and mosy people dont like country.There are some bad movies out there but they are fun to watch becaues there ether funn,gross,or they are sad but there bad movies are groess or funn.       If people made better magazines then they wouldnt have that much money then that buissness will go out of buissness and that not a good thing because the  person that runns the buissness will have no money to feed his kids.Sence i have been alive nost of the good thing like books,music,magazines have changed because people dont like the stuff from a long time ago. If they do it again then people will  stop going to the movies and buying books so that wht i think.     Now there are alot of good movies and music coming out so if they brought back all the stuff they use to have then people would have more money.Why people would have more money is because more people would go se the movies from back in the old days.So like movie like from @NUM1 and even @NUM2 would make a lot mof monoey.     So that why i think they should not take stuff off because that is how we are loseing all hour money.The people are useing the that they would for movies or books and stuff they are useing for drugs and other stuff that can get them sent to jail and stuff",2,2
3519,"Some books are offensive to some people. But eveyrone has the right to read any book they want. I believe we shouldnt censor books that are found offensive in schools. If people find offensive from the beggining, find another book to read or talk to the teacher.           I have had my experience with books who are offensive to me. Everyone has a book they have read that does that to them. But that same book i have read might be interesting to other people. Whatever doesnt @CAPS1 you makes you stronger, right? So don't take a book in a hurtful way. Books are meant to be read and some authors direct the book to certain people.      I had poeple come up to me from our own school saying the books they read were a horrible experience. Specially when all they talk about is suicide and one of my best friends has trouble with that because of her dad. I told her to talk to her teacher and he changed the book for her. Thats all you have to do and not make anything big about it.      I also read the book, 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2', which is censored in some states because its hurtful to some people. The story is about a white family trying to help an @CAPS3-@CAPS4 man who was accused of raped when he never commited such thing. That was not acceptable at the time and with all the evidence in the world they still couldn't help him. Its a great story about what black poeple went through in earlier years. And to think they would censor a story about a white lawyer trying to help someone who isn't his own race is inspiring to me, not offensive.      He got harrased and his children got harrased but he still fought with all he had to save his deffendant. I am a @NUM1 year old boy who when he read this book knowing who had a heart and who didnt made me cry my eyes out. It's sad to know this book is censored in some states when this is defenitely one of the best books i have ever read and also the only one that got to me. It would be a great experience for anybody to read this book so even if it is censored where you live, go buy it and read it anyway.      I feel the state assumes they are gonna offend people. They might not even test it anyways. They might just say its gonna offend this kinda people and thats it. How do they cokme up with it? Do they let everybody read it once? No, and they should just leave it whoever doesn't read it doesnt have to or they can talk with their teacher. Its not so hard to decide to censor something when its only your opinion. Thats why i would look into the opinion of others.     All in all censorship shouldn't be allowed. It ruins the oppurtonity for people to read books they might find good and interesting to them. Let the kids read atleast in highschool when they are all almost adults so they can read whatever they want",4,4
3217,"Whispers and comments fill the room while people make their way throughout the library. The critialzing of books and materials that are neatly stacked in the shelves, are taken and miss treated from the harsh people that think they are offensive. In my point of view, I strongly agree that there is no right to argue about what should or should not be removed in the libraries.      The reflecting of my own views along with the libraries, shows intertest in the materials for people all over the world. The reason that I, myself, do not believe in this situation is how it mentioned in Katherine Paterson's passage. It explained, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 everybody around has a unique part about themselves, and that is having a different look on something than someone else might have. This leads into taking a material or book they see, the wrong way and being offensive about it. However, there might be someone else that does not view that same exact book is wrong, but instead, see's something else that could lead to be offensive to them as well.      To make this observation not as confusing, I will share my own experience that might help focuse more on my argument. There is a time when I went to the library and saw books and especially magazines throughout, that had an impact on colored people. It described how it would be like, if there was still slavery and that if everybody wasn't taught or treated equal amongst everyone else. In this situation, it could go both ways on how colored people tend to look and feel about this. Maybe the people are relieved and interested, knowing they are free now. On the other hand however, many colored people might get in an awkward position, having no passion of bringing the equiality up in the present world, or even the future. Many might want to forget about what happened, instead of books and magazines still publishing articles and stories about it. Again, this argument might go both ways, meaning one less book would be off the shelf, or many would be newly stacked aside from the others.     When people think of materials, they most likly think of something that symbolizes an event, time period, or a symbol itself. This could also have an impact on the censorship in libraries. The way people want to take roll in the things they are part of, might actually be found in the library. However, someone that thinks there is no right for it to be shown, will remove the material. This tends to make the people that thought it was right, not find the interest they wanted to recieve.     Another arugment people might have is that libraries are a public place, right? Well this should cut back or maybe even add more pull into what they can or can not share within their readings, materials, and movies. People might think that they have a right to argue or take the offensive actions out. Not so quick though as people can prove that they can put anything back as well. Well, instead of picking and choosing, I think everything should be left alone and people should only go to the section of interest they are looking for and leave the other materials out of their view.     My experience and observations about this argument has covered why I, and all of you, should reflect on the views of censorship the approperiate way in libraries. Not saying this will control all the problems, but it will help from removing all of materials that could have a big roll in future process of taching children, teachers, and of course, each and everyone",4,4
3075,"The old saying one should never judge a book by it's cover comes into litteral meaning with this particular subject. Every mind that is among the world is extremely different, just as every book is. One person @MONTH1 look upon a certain subject as offensive, while others @MONTH1 not have the same point of view. However, in my personal opinion books with 'suggestive' references or language should be placed in sections marked mature and clearly labeled with a warning of the contents lieing between the pages. With over a billion different points of views residing all over the world, why should books that only a few select find inappropriate people be removed?     Every person has their own life story and rough experiences. Life's journey brings bumps in the road which can scare someone deeply and change their life forever. While reading a book, a viewer @MONTH1 skim across a passage that brings horrible experiences swelling back up in them. For one to have to relive a trauma that they have struggled to get over isn't right, but for another to read about a situation similar to a particular person's life journey could possibly grant them more understanding and compassion for the victim. I do not believe victims of abuse no matter what degree should have to read about that subject in a book they thought they were reading for leisure. However, these books should not be taken off the shelves because people who have not had to endure a struggle such as this should be able to grasp a better understanding for the other person.      Books for a more mature mind should be monitored and placed upon a shelf out of reach from a child who can not yet handle that topic. At a young age I selected a book I had thought was a ghost story. Mid way through I came to the understanding that the book was truly about a young girl my age being raped. As a sixth grader I was horrified because I was not yet exposed to that danger of the world, and I was not mature enough to handle that subject. For weeks I walked the halls scaared that I might have the same fate as the girl in the story I had read. Books with mature topics should be seperated from those for younger childeren, because the description in a book @MONTH1 leave a child with emotional scares.     Labeling books clearly with any 'suggestive' content the book @MONTH1 contain would help this issue tremendously. If books are clearly labeled that they contain offensive words, comments, or horrifying situations, then a reader who will become offended will have less likely of a chance to grab the material. If children who are still developing their level of maturity come across a book that mentions inappropriate subjects, they will have a better understanding of what they @MONTH1 be about to view. By simply pressing a label on a book that states the concerns can be found within the pages, it will save the world alot of harm.     If books begin to fly off the shelves because of offensive topics, their won't be many books left to read. Every person takes a different look at what a story says, just as every age group comprehends the message that passages give differently. By monitoring and labeling books, book worms will be able make a quick decision on whether or not the material they think they want to read is for them. So, in conclusion don't take away the wanders of reading from those who enjoy traveling through the imagination of books, but let them know exactly what they will see as they mosey through the unknown pages of a new adventure.",4,5
4089,"I think @CAPS4's ok to have books even if they are found offensive, because to some people those books aren't found offensive.                                                                                                     People shouldn't let what is in books bother them. The way I see @CAPS4 is, if the book offends you, then don't read @CAPS4. There is no reason to throw a big tantrum over a book, that to some people isn't offensive. I agree that books that are offensive are bad, but then again that's why you have the choice to @CAPS1 not open @CAPS4.     @CAPS4 would be easier to find certain things if we @CAPS1 had a library for everything. Like for instance, music. if we had a library for @CAPS1 music, @CAPS4 would be easier to narrow down things and find exactly what you are looking for. Same thing with movies and magazines. The only problem with this solution is the economic expenses.     Back to the point. I've never ran across an offensive book, and if I did, I would @CAPS1 simply put @CAPS4 back. Why take a good book to many people off the shelf @CAPS1 because one person might think @CAPS4's offensive? Most libraries have labels for certain books anyway. If you know what kind of book your looking for then @CAPS4 shouldn't be offensive.     Books are a good thing and aren't meant to be bad. Books are for entertainment and fun, and they shouldn't be found offensive. I've said @CAPS4 before, and I'll say @CAPS4 again. If you find a book offensive @CAPS1 put @CAPS4 back on the shelf and leave @CAPS4 be.     Music on the other hand, is offensive to many people. I mean, let's face @CAPS4, we all have a type of music we love and a type of music we hate. They're are a lot of offensive songs in the world, which I personally think shouldn't be around at all, and putting @CAPS4 in libraries is even worse. Music is a persuasive thing, and if a kid walks into a library and picks up an appealing @CAPS2, @CAPS4 could be bad. That @CAPS2 could have everything about doing drugs on @CAPS4, which persuades kids to do them, and no one wants their kids doing drugs.     I say that if you find anything offensive that should be taken out of libraries, @CAPS4's music, not books.     I've pretty much said all that has been needed to have been said. books are books, they're offensive to some people, and to some people, they're not. In the end, @CAPS4's all a matter of opinion",4,4
4177,"When it comes to the decision of certain materials being allowed in the library, there are many different aspects that must be considered. There isn't a particular audience that visits a library. Many types of people go to libraries looking for different things. Blocking types of materials will lose an audiences interest and they will go eslewhere. Now that doesnt mean that offensive materials are acceptable and here is why.     There should be a level of intensity in which the item is offensive. Profanity, and action are minor types of offense. However, intense violence and explicit materials such as blood and such needs to have conditions.Categorization is an acceptable method to blocking some @CAPS1 from viewing harmful materials. Putting violent books in an area that is blocked to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 is an effective way to restrict children. Adults would not want to go into this section and therefore would'nt be an issue. It is understandable that some people are offended by the materials showcased in libraries because a library is a place for everyone. If offensive items were availible only to those who wanted it and hidden from the public, then this is something that could solve the problem.     Many individuals should realize that a library isn't a place for one type of person and must be shared by all types. When it comes books they can be placed in areas availible to epople who enjoy it. The same applies for magazines and movies. Movies is a form of entertainment that is strongly advertsied over magazines and books. Any advertisement that show explicit material or offensive pictures or text should be removed from the view of the public. These advertisements should be only viewable by the audience it was inteded for.      If @CAPS1 wish to use computers there are rules that need to be applied as well. @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1 should have safety precautions that block them from using the computer to look up harmful material, @CAPS1 over the age of @NUM1 know how to avoid certain material and proceed at their own risk. These computers should be seperated to avoid peeking eyes from children or anyone who finds the material to be appualing. Listening to music on the the computer or by a device should require a couple of things as well. If there is a song that isnt preferable to a certain audience or it offends someone headphones should be a requirement. The library is a place for peace and quiet so headphones are necessary regardless. This can potentially eleminate the problem as long as the headphones themsleves are at an appropriate level. If @CAPS1 want to check out any materials that is or can be offensive or explicit in some way  they must prove their age of maturity, due to some items with slight violence being availible to @CAPS1 under the age of @NUM1.     In conclusion, if the categorization of harmful or explicit materials is placed properly and out of view of unwanted viewers or children this can eleminate the issue. Music is to be played through headphones only and must be at an appropriate volume. No items should not be removed from shelves if they offend people but conditions should be enforced. With rules and conditions the library can be a safe and enjoyable place for everyone.",4,4
4283,"Controversey and @CAPS1     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' (Katherine Paterson, Author.) Paterson makes a very valid point here. Right off the bat, I can think of many offensive or inappropriate books, movies, songs, and magazines. There are equal amounts of good and bad publications, and the decision of what is good or bad is very controvesial.     The creator of each song, movie, song, magazine, or any other publication has made their product for a specific customer. Playboy magazine was not created for five year olds, but for desparate sex-crazed men, and @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 wasn't made for adults, but for young kids. Usually, the intended purpose of the product is not meant to be negative.      It breaks my heart to hear of the rising amount of people of varrying ages getting into pornography. I think the whole idea of it is wrong, degrading, and uttterly disgusting, but others firmly disagree. Some religions think the @CAPS4 series is blasphemous evil, as others don't agree at all. Controversey fills everything in our culture. We all have our opinions and choices.      Should I have the right to take away books from my child? My mother would not let me read the @ORGANIZATION1 books when I was younger. She felt that it was from the devil and pure evil. That make me desire to read it even more than before. When I entered middle school, I read the books anyway: I had the ability to make my own choices. I didn't see the devil in the books. I actually felt the opposite feelings toward the book. The books reflected upon good vs. evil, which I saw as @CAPS5 vs. Satan. My opinions and views were very different than my mother's.     If I would have read the books when I was younger, I might've thought differently. I think that my mom protected me from what could have been bad. I think it is perfectly fine to protect your kids by setting up rules and boundaries. Parents just need to be aware that once the kids are older, they will make the choices on their own.      All in all, certain books will be in the kids section for a reason, and others will be in the adult section for other reasons. We must use our judgement and trust our kids to make good choices on what they allow to enter their brain and consume their thoughts.",4,4
4209,"The ideas conveyed by literature, music, and movies are an art.  They cannot be explained in any other way than themselves, and if we take away the right to produce or the right to sell these masterpieces, then the world loses something of itself.     Censorship is the underlying problem to many things.  It takes away the expression of human thought and emotion- emotions like greed, love, fear, and the ability to empathize that are conveyed in books and films.  If people think it's offensive, they simply can't take the truth.       Many people can only express themselves in their art- and art can be very real.  So real that we don't think that it's possible.  We don't want to believe something like 'The @CAPS1' could happen.  'The @CAPS1' is a short story in which kids get together and rob an old man's home.  Because this man is very rich, he has lots of material wealth.  Then they burn down the house with the man's belongings still in it.  Needless to say, this story has been banned from many schools and libraries.  But what many don't understand is why would the kids burn down the house.  Many think that the kids just want to see it burn, to destroy what is so cherished, or that the love of material things is making us greedy.  It is this that makes us think, and therein lies the problems with censorship.  If we censor something that makes us think this hard about who we are and what we do here, then we begin to lose ourselves.     The loss of books has been seen throughout history.  Most prominantly, the nazi regime.  In the beginning of their control of power, they banned certain books that went against the nazi ideals.  The censorship escalated into the nazis burning books in large piles. This communal burning would make it easier to control the public mindset.  The movement swelled and the  @CAPS3 people soon developed a national pride and goal.  By the @DATE1's, nearly every @CAPS3 who could read had read '@CAPS5 @CAPS6'.  The censorship had turned into an all-out war on classical literature and the promotion of nazi ideas.  That was how @CAPS7 was actually voted in.  Many don't realize, but the @CAPS8 actually did vote @CAPS7 to be leader.  Now that the nazis had destroyed the publics ideals, they were replaced with the nazi's own.     The banning of media can only lead to a general lack of self knowledge.  The human mindset can only be expressed through the art which the human creates.  If we try to explain it, we soon get lost in our words.  The use of verbal and visual examples is the only way we learn who we are.  Censorship has never ended in something good- only the promotion of something bad.  If we let our media get banned, we lose the right to have ideas of our own.",4,4
3116,"I think that if there are books, music @CAPS1, movies, or magazines that we should have a right to take it off the shelf if its offensive. The reason why I think this is, because I have a baby girl who I don't want to see that kind of stuff. I don't want her listening or watching movies or reading anything offensive or vulgar.           I know this is a free country and everyone has the right to have their own opinions. The libraries are paid by tax payers dollars and if we take the offensive to vuglar movies, books, music and magazines then they should come off the shelf.  Kids can read or see or listen the these vulgar things an think its ok or cool to say or do these things.     They can see bad pictures, nudity, drugs and violence. They can see the different types of drugs and learn about them. For example pictures of weed, cocaine or pills are in books. The kids can look at this stuff and see violence. For example they can see pictures of  men hitting women or kids killing kids and this sets a bad example.     We live in a world where people are influenced by the things they read, watch, and listen to. It is important that people are aware of what their children are seeing. The library is a place where many people go to learn. It is important that only people are allowed to see material that is appropriate for them",3,3
4729,"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. Libraries are given to people for new learning opportuites and for entertainment purposes. Everyone has their own likes and dislikes, not two peoples are the same.     First of all when a person goes to the library they should know that the books that are in there were selected by the owner of the library. Therefore it is their responsibility to put books into the library and take books out. What the owner of a library will try to do is to put a little bit of everything in it. What is ment by this statement is that there are so many differnt types of writting that people are bound to not like something. So that is why the owner will add a bit of everything into their library.      If someone has gotten a book that seems to be to their type of book, but after they start to read it they find it offensive to them they should not just throw the book out all together, but they should take it back to the library and talk to the owner about it. People have their rights to do what they want with a book, but if it is a book from the library then it technically is proporty of the library. So if someone gets offended with a book they should go talk to the owner let them know their concern, and try to have something done about it. In truth they will not be the only ones who have that oppionin. It takes one person to make the difference.      Books are not made for just one person they are made for many people to read and possibly enjoy. People have their oppininons and will stick by them. Thats expected to happen with books, they are all different as are people. The society that everyone lives in is filled with people of diverse oppions and who are not afraid of expressing them. There is nothing wrong with expressisng them eigther, actually its better that way only because then others can hear about a book and eigther agree with that oppionoin or disagree, therefore finding out what type of writing do they really like.      Books yes can be thrown out by rights, but the moment everyone starts doing that is the moment when everyone can no longer spread their oppionion. To spread an oppion is to let the world know wehre someone stands on a spacific topic. Without that the world would be just plain old boring having nothing to talk about because people would all share the same opinoin. Censorship in libraries should not be allowed for more reasons than one.                                       ~~@PERSON1",4,4
3377,"I do not beleive that certain materials such as books, music,, movies, magazines and ect. should be remove, unless if it has nudity or a lot of cussing in the books. Because some books and movies are bad to show little kids. But i think we should have anything, that teaches you something in the labrary. plus people have to do reports and homework on some books, and if its about something with a little cussing and kinda graphic it should be ok. i think if the library have these kind of books, movies, music and magazines they should let you if you are a certain age or have a note from a teacher that you need that book, or some kind of rule that lets you choice any kind of book but with permission.     The library's would have more people going if they had more books and better ones. Because most of the things that people like is in the books or movies that the library wont have. So it just depends on the situation. There is a lot of offensive things out there, it doesnt mean you can keep it away from people. They will find out anyways sooner or later. I think its unnessary for the libraries to do that. I always hate when i try to get something when you find out you have to be @NUM1 or older or have an adult with you. plus some people dont have computers or enternet excess, so they cant look up things easly. They have to drive down to the library to look something up and if you are lucky they might have the thing you are looking for at the library, but if they dont that sucks. So thats my opinion about have offensives things on the shelves.",2,2
3096,"I belive that they need to keep every thing and gain more. Their is so much to luearn about. The more information you have the better. I for one think that they need to put more magazines on the stands so you can have more information. Thow you can not trust every thing in one, You can still find many facts about what your wanting to learn about. On the other hand, Children should not be able to reach or see some of this. I could teach our children stuff that they are not yet ready to learn about. The fact is they need to have people watching the stuff so kids wont get in it and we can still lurean and find out new things. Not everything should be hidden. The more you know could just save the world.",1,1
3960,"In a way many books are put on the library shelf for a reason. Some of the books take race, sexism, bullying, ect., to extreme. Putting myself in a child's shoes when they read those books, magazines, movies, music, ect., would have to be scary. The languages in movies and music are not what we think they are. Would you want your child, that's @NUM1, to go out and do what the other @NUM1 year olds do because they think it is cool for others to do?     Remember back in the days when you were young and your parents didn't have to worry about what you were doing because your generation wasn't like the generations now? Well, these generations to come will probably get worse if we don't do something about it now. Taking some books off a shelf, or taking profanities out of a song will not hurt a child or teenager one bit. These things are telling your children it is ok to have sex, smoke, drink, or even cuss.      I know that my mother worries about me @NUM3, because she's always calling me to check up on me and asking how my day was, or if i had any problems today. If we work together on taking care of all of the profanities then i bet the world would be a much safer and nicer place. Bullying wouldn't be a problem anymore; neither would cyer space or the drugs and alcohol. You need to step up and show your children that doing those things are not exceptable or nessesary in any life. Remember them that there is a whole life out there without the sex, drugs, and profanities.     So, the next time you think that your going to buy a dvd or a cd preview it before you buy it. Make sure that if your child listened to it that it wouldnt be hurtful or have any profanities in it. Make sure that you talk to your child about what is right and wrong. Lets make these profanities go away on their own. If they aren't something you want your child to listen to then you shouldn't listen to it either",4,4
4380,"Since the beginning there has always been someone who is offended by certain media. Books, movies, and music have been the main focus of the subject of this controversy. There have been arguments over it so severe that it has went to court! The people that have been upset over media have caused there to be certain censorships over these materials.           I believe that there should not be censorship in media. I think that there are are books, movies, and other media materials that can be found offensive to someone or a group of people. This is why they should have labels or at least a description on the back of these products that explain what could cause someone to become upset by it. If something is considered too vulgar for the public eye then they should have it somewhere more discret, but not be taken off the shelves. I disagree that media materials should be taken of shelves for being offensive. Media is all about someones free expression and trying to share it with the world. There are around @NUM1 billion people in the world and at least one of them is bound to enjoy the same type of media you do.     A great example of a media material that is challenged every day in every part of the world is a book called the bible. The bible is considered to be one of the oldest books in the world and is still in print. People of different religions can sometimes find the print of bibles over there religious books offensive and there is always great controversy about it. All these movies and books though are great because they are different and free! The world needs people who challenge ideas and religions. Every single person in the world is unique and I think it is great for everyone to put their opinions out for others to find so they can have a new view on the subject or at least contemplate it.     Society has already put parental advisory warnings on cds, put ratings on movies, and labeled books as challenged. All this does is restrict the public from finding new ideas to compare to and form opinions. I believe in freedom of thinking because it is the most valuable resource that we have, it is what sets us apart from each other. Let media be free so men, women, and children from all over the globe can be unique and wonderful! Censorship will be challenged in years to come and I will help challenge it for all to be free and happy",3,4
4335,"Did you know that libraries contain books, movies, music, magazines, etc.? Yes ! They have it all, if you ever need something for research or a project just go there. But if there is something that you do not like, just keep going.           I do not think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. I think that if it is something that offends you then you should just keep going. That 'something' that might offend you, could be helpful to others.          So, now you know if you ever see something that you don't like in the library just walk away. It could be helpful to you and others. If things offend you, how would the next person learn? They won't. Don't only think about your self, think about others in the situation also.",2,3
3741,Censorship in Libraries     I think that censorship in a library is fine some people @MONTH1 feel that children don't need to see certain things. Which that @MONTH1 be true there are a lot of things that even adult shouldn't even see themselves. If there is going to be bad things in the library the owners might make a section just for those things.      People should have the right to be able to look at anything that they want in the library,2,2
3699,"My views on censorship, I don't belive in any type of censorship. Books, music, and movies shouldn not be censored.     When it comes to children, it should be the parent's responsability to choose what they feel children should and shouldn't read, watch, or listen to. Taking books, movies, and music off selves isn't fair to thoose who want to read, watch, or listen to them or to the authors, directors, or musicions.      People should have the freedom to write whatever they want, the reader dosen't have to agree or enjoy the things the author is saying, but it is his freedom to say it",2,3
4056,"Should books that seem offensive to you be put off of the selves? I know that most people who agree that it would 'better' our kids if the didn't read or listen to certain things. But, what would happen if everything that we thought was wrong was taken off of the self?     I do not think that we have any right to take a book off of shelves because of it contens. If I look at a certain book and think, '@CAPS1 book is offending me and my beleives,' then I should just not read the book. Just becauseit is offensive to me doesn't mean it will offened someone else. Every book that has ever been written has effect someone, either in a good way or a bad way. Does that mean they have the right to say, 'take them off the shelves?'      I remember when I was in second grade, there was these girl in my class who's mother came in to complain about my teacher playing gospel music while we worked. The parent was extremly engery at the teacher and, at that time, I didn't know why.Now I realize that it was because they didn't believe in what the lyrics in the song were saying. The teacher never played the music in class again and was to afraid to play anyother type of music.     Since everyones views are different, by the time every person took off the books that offended them, there would be no books left. As Katherine Paterson put it, 'But if I have the right to remove that book form the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly that same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     In conclusion, I strongly think that books, weather they offended someone or not, should be kept of the selves. Taking the book off wouldn't accomplish anything to begin with.",3,3
3153,"Everyone has a right to read, listen, or watch what they want. Sometimes it's not always up to them. For example rated-@CAPS1 movies, most children under @NUM1 cannot watch them. Either its a law or the parents have made it a rule. Music I think is different. Some songs have a bad influence on children whether it has to do with violence or cussing, certain songs like that still give kids the wrong message. Libraries should not have those kind of books, music, movies, magazines, etc. If people want to view those kind of things that other people find 'offensive' they should buy them on their own time. Not everyone has a great sense of humor so things that some people @MONTH1 find funny other people get offended by. Even if libraries had anything that would offened someone else, it would be the readers choice to pick a book they want to read.      Sometimes it @MONTH1 be better off if the children read these articles by themselves so it'd save time from having parents explain it to them later. They might ask a lot of questions the parents might not even have the answer for. For example, when my brother watched a rated-@CAPS1 movie. In my brother's younger years he was always curious and asked a lot of questions all the time. Sometimes my mother didn't know how to respond so she'd change the subject. Well, everyone knows the same old question '@CAPS3 do babies come from?'. That's the kind of question my brother was curious about. My mom never bothered to answer that question, but if she did she would make up some story. My brother was smart enough to know that what he was being told wasnt accurate at all. Finally one day he got nosy and took one of my mom's movies without asking. It happen to have the answer to his question. He was shocked and disgusted at the same time yet he was glad to know he finally found the answer my mom wouldnt give.     In this situation I am somewhat nuetral. I dont object to having things that might offened other people be removed from book shelves but on the other hand it might not be a good thing to put 'offensive' things and certain libraries @CAPS3 children can get to them. Perhaps it's what makes things not boring and makes it more interesting to the reader. Not everyone has the same opinion on things. It just @MONTH1 be a good thing to have these types of books whether its stating a fact or stating their own opinion. Everyone does have a right to say their opinion and there is nothing wrong with giving informational facts in articles or movies either.     The bad thing about having any 'offensive' things in libraries @MONTH1 not be a smart idea if it's @CAPS3 most children get there books. Parentscan always have a say in what kind of book their children read or what kind of movies they watch. Some parents might not want to go through all the questions the children ask and give something to them that will explain it better for there understanding, while other parents dont want their children  to see or know of any sort of things that @MONTH1 be 'offensive' until their old enough to understand it better and are mature about those things. So in some cases it might be bad idea for things that only an adult should know be on book shelves in a library @CAPS3 a child might get ahold of it.     The quotation ' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' by Katherine Paterson has its own opinion. The quotation is basically  saying if even a parent doesnt want their child to read something 'offensive' if that parent reads it that sometime their children have a right to know. If the child has tooken anything like that off a shelf that once they know they will not ask anymore questions.",4,4
4235,"Has anyone ever stopped and thought about the negative aspects of censoring a book? Many people of different beliefs take offense to books that show negativity to their ideas. When people are offended by a book the first idea that comes to mind is to try and get the book off the shelves by censoring it from libraries. I think that if a book offends a certain group of people they should just simply not read it.     Why should other people not get a chance to read a good book just because it offends someone else? Banning books would go against what our country stands for. How different would it make us if we started censoring books in our libraries like other countries with governments who have the final say on what can and can not be read?      Imagine what life would be like if all books found offensive were stripped from our shelves; there would be nothing left because anyone can find something offensive in any book. I understand that sometimes things written in books can really be disturbing ,and offensive but that doesnt give anyone the right to just take it off the shelves. Censoring books is a short term answer to a long term problem.     I believe that if we always resort to censoring books then we will become a less creative society. There are many people who @MONTH1 actually want to read a book but never get chance just because it is censored from library. Books that are censored are usually the books that help ones imagination. Would you want to live in a world where people are void of creativity?",3,3
3101,"No, i do not think that books, magizines, movies and music should be removed. However, I do think that the books, magizines, movies, and music should be monitred by age. The reason why is because younger children sould not be reading , listening, or watching material that is for adults or teenagers.       They way these type of things can be monitred is by the child's library card. The card could have their name, age, grade, and date of birth. If there is a certain book, magizine, movie, and music that the child want a parent has to be there with them. The parent needs to show a form of identification so that the librian knows that the parent  is of age.           Teenagers should also be moniterd. Event though they are almost adults. Some parents @MONTH1 not agree with some of the material. So, if their parents does not want them reading certain things their should be stickers on their cards.     Even though there are plenty of opinions about what a persons child is reading , watching, or listening to I think there should be certain ways to watch what children are reading, watching or listening to",3,3
3686,"Cencorship     The topic I am going to discuss today is censorship. Do you think that censorship is a good thing or a bad thing? I am going to list a couple of ways that i think censorship is bad and also why it is good.     The first thing I am going to talk to you about is how it is bad. The bad part about censorship is that it can offend people very easily. Most people can handle alot of abuse, but on the otherhand alot of people can't.      In my oppinion I think that it is fine to have some things out that offend people because that is how alot of people find humor. Such as political cartoon. They make fun of the @CAPS1 and alot of the other people that are in office, but you dont see them complaining about it. In my oppinion if you dont like it then dont read it. That is all you have to do and then it will never bother you again.     But on the other hand i can see how some people can get offended. Because some of the things are very mean in books and movies. I think that there should be some type of line that seperates going to fare and what is good enough. most people can live with it, but others can't. Such as @CAPS2, there is a whole lot of @CAPS2 in the @LOCATION1, and expecally in this time period. where ever you go there is always some sort of @CAPS2.     In conclusion I think that people need to get together and create a line that can be drawn befor they get to far. and some of the stuff now needs to be taking off of the shelves, but not everything",3,3
3155,The censorship in libraries should be as gog as it is for that age group. Children of the age @NUM1 to @NUM2 should be able to read books with any profanity. they should be mature enough to get through a book that has name calling and uses the profanity without laughing or taking it offensive.     Children that are @NUM3 should not have books in their libraries with much of this pro-found languge. They are young and should not be expecting the fact that there people that use these words to express feeling or name calling. They should be able to hear very little or see very little but when they get older they are suppose to be use to this. If they dont hear it as much then yes i would agree but they should have a point of censorship in the libraries they are in.      With children that are younger than @NUM4 years of age they should not read or seee things that have profanity or bad scenes unless their parents let them. We cannot controll what parents lets their children do but we can in the schools and in the public libraries,3,3
4117,"In the library I have noticed that there are a few literature materials that are not suitable for a younger age group. Such as rated @CAPS1 movies that contain things like drug use, sexual content, and extreme violence. Not all libraries have movies, and the ones that do don't let anyone under the age of @NUM1 rent out a rated @CAPS1 movie. Another example would be magazines that have articles/advertisments and pictures that are more towards the sexual side. This is a problem with children because then they think that that's how they should look and act, when they are older.     Most libraries are divided up into different sections, there is a section for adults, teens, and children. The sections were created for a reason to show/tell people that some materials in this section @MONTH1 not be suitable for teens and children. Then if your in a childrens section you know that not many over the age of @NUM2 will be wanting to look around for books. In the childrens section a library normally makes it look bright and colorful which most children love. This helps the children stay there and not wonder off into one of the adult or teen sections.      When I was younger I didn't really care to go into the adult or teen sections cause I enjoyed reading 'The @CAPS3 in the @CAPS4', '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8', and many other children books there. Children have a lot of things to satisfy them at the library there's children movies/shows like '@CAPS9 @PERSON1'. They also have an unlimited amout of books that can keep them entertained. If movies and books don't work for them then there are also a few toys they can play with (at least the libraries I've been to have toys).         The only real big problem with having things unapropriate in the library is that the younger teens might wander into the adult section, and sometimes there are adult things in the young adult section. Again with the movies, there are tv shows that I've seen at the library that are about teens doing drugs going to parties and getting drunk. Things like that I think put a bad influence on younger teens. Making them think it's okay to do drugs and drink, that it will make them more popular and cool.      Over all I think that libraries just need to reorganize there books, movies, and magazines. Then all the right items will be put in the right sections and there will be no accidents where someone accidently picks up something that is inapropitate for their age group. The music in the library I don't think is much of a problem. To me music is something more to express your feelings. This is my view on censorship in libraries",4,4
4486,"Should materials that some people find offensive be removed from libraries? No I do not think that any materials should be removed from libraries. A librarie should have lots of different kinds of books, magazines, music, and movies.     One reason I think that a librarie should have all sorts of different books is because everybody doesn't like to read the same thing. Like for example some kids could love to read scary and gory books and others could like to read books about sports or love stories. So maybe the kids that read sport books could be offended by all the gory books, but that wouldn't be fair to take them out of the librarie because some kids like to read gory books.     Another reason they shouldn't remove any magazines, books, etc, is because it is nice to get to read or look at different things. People would get bored if their librarie only had books about war. Kids need to learn how to read different kinds of stories. Also if your librarie has all different kinds of magazines kids could learn a lot of interesting facts. You can find a lot of amazing things in a magazine. So if you only had four magazines about the same thing kids wouldn't discover anymore cool facts.     A librarie is a place where kids like to go and enjoy some peace and quiet and look and read different things. So I think if you started taking specific things out of the librarie then I think kids would stop coming to the librarie. A librarie contains awsome infromation that kids could learn, but if you start taking things out then not that many kids will come to the librarie because they will not be learning @CAPS1 new.     So if I had any say in this I would keep all things in the librarie. I would not remove @CAPS1! You want people to come to your librarie so you dont want to do @CAPS1 that can jeperdize people coming to your librarie. I think if you start removing things then your going to have less and less people come in and eventually maybe your librarie will get shut down because you have no buisness. So leave everything on the shelves.",4,4
3895,"The things we find in libararies shouldn't be offensive to anybody. It's the choice you make rather you won't to read it or not. Nobody is making look at those things if you don't want to. Don't look at it, if you think it's offensive.     The best thing to do is to keep it on the shelves. Some people like looking or reading things like that. People don't go to the library and pick up a book or a movie that they know they wouldn't like. If that was to happen, then there wouldn't be any library around because anything you get from the library, I bet you can find something offensive about it. People find stuff like that entertaning when watch or read stuff like that.     That hurt the people that make the books and movies that are offensive because they feel like thats what people wan't to see. True enough thats what people won't see as long as it's not effecting them in no kind of way. That what we see on a daily basic on tv is offensive things, so if we can sit there and watch it on tv then we shouldn't have on problem reading or watching a book about it. I see stuff offensive on tv about everyday, but it doesn't bother me so reading a book or anything else like that, I woudn't care because i'm use to seeing it on tv.     Nobody can make read or stop reading things like that, only you can. You don't have to look at it if you think its offensive. It shouldn't be a problem with anyone because thats what we hear and see everyday. No matter what some people find that entertaning.",4,4
3944,"Should you conceal a child from the inappropriate half of the world? Not letting them hear, see, or read the bad in the world. Letting them grow up as innocent as possible. Should libraries take these procautions?     In a world like ours were bad things happen everyday when it comes to people comminting suicide, being murdered, goverment scams, and even terrorist attacks its hard to keep people that shouldnt know, from knowing. It is very easy for our nation to figure things out, all we have to do is watch @CAPS1.V. or even go to our local library. While we already censor what goes onto our television, we dont think to care as much for our libraries. Our libraries have anything from thousands of book and magizines and now having an equal, or more, amounts of movies, @CAPS2, and videogames.     I think a library should have censorship when it comes to what they have and how they organize it. There should be different sections of libraries, much like they do now, of age groups and what is appropriate for them, and to avoid people checking-out items that are from sections above them they have an age group security check on the libraries card fileing system. This sounds very complicated but at least we are doing as much as possible for trying not to expose anyone to anything they are to young for.     When it comes to offensive material, I think that should not be taken off the shelf but put into a different place in the library. Some people need to read some thing they find offensive, maybe they need to read it for a class, maybe the book is offensive but needs to be read because it teaches a very good life lesson. There is a book that is called '@CAPS3' its by a man with the last name of @LOCATION1. It sounds very offensive but it actually teaches people the origin of the word and how it came to be offensive to people. It @MONTH1 be offensive for some people to read but it teaches a lesson in why people shouldnt say it.     Yes, there are always going to be some parents out there that don'@CAPS1 care as much when it comes to what there child read, watches, listens to, or plays. But, for there kids to get it, there parents will have to come and get it for them, that way the parents know what they are extracting from the library.",4,4
4444,well if one person has a right to something then it would only be fair for the other people to have a right for the same thing.     That would be like having six kids in one room and for no reason at all just give three kids a cookiee and not the other three that wouldnt be right now would it.     so if one person ones that book then another person wants that same book then they would have every right to grab that book and theres really nothing could say to them.     i know how it feels not haveing the same right as every one else like one time my teacher gave my friend a piece of gum for no reason at all and i was mad because i didnt get a pieace i thought if he got a pieace of gum for no reason then the rest of us should get one for no reason.     like said you give a right to one person then you should give that right to another person now i could under stand if three people were in  volved in a fight and the third person was just standing there wactching the dont have the right to go to jail but the two that was phiscally fighting then they have every right to sit in jail and think about the fight now the third guy that was wacthing he dont have the right to keep in any videos of the fight and he sould get a tickect,3,3
4581,"@CAPS2, I do believe that book, music, mvies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves if they are taken offensive. Poeple should not be putting stuff out there if they are making others feel not happy about what they do. Althought, we might think that putting stuff in papers and on movies, don't hurt people. Well guess what they do     @CAPS1 of all, movies that have stuff to deal with sexual relationships. For example, gender marrage, they say that people should not marry the same sex. They make fun of them because they are not like others and they can take that very offensive. Very little people like being with the same sex. By us putting them in book, on movies, or making song to make them feel offensive is not the best way to go.      Another one is about special needs, movie or book that have to deal with people putting down others that have special problems. Although, they don't show that thier sad it don't mean that we didn't offened them in a way. Families that have a special needs child, sister, brother, mom or dad don't like it very much when someone outs something out there about their problem that they @MONTH1 have. Also, they will feel really upset and sometimes can get mad for that.     Most importantly, books or movies making fun of people that don't have a lot of stuff. It's not their fault that they don't have the money to buy stuff like others. For example, a nice house or nice clothes, most families have problems trying to pay rent and do other bills if only one parent is working. A lot of parents that work are gettin laid off are not even gettin paid for it. Worst of all, a famliy member (like someone who lives in the house) @MONTH1 have to go to the hospital and whe you go to the hopstial you have to pay for the bills. Some families are in and out of the hospital year after year and they don't have the money to pay for new stuff for the house or the people who live in it.     In conclusion, @CAPS2. i do believe that they shoukd take certain books, movies, mafazines, ect., off the shelves because they can be taken offensive. We don't know how rude it is to have something out there that makes fun of someone in a way until it's to late. Many people really don't like it when they see something out there thats offensive to them. They don't know how to react about it and they get frustrated",4,3
3600,"Parents should tell their kids what they are allowed to read at certain ages. That is where my opinion will start, and tell why it is that way. I will talk about why I disagree with this statement. Also, give reasons on why i feel this way about the statement.     I really think that anyone should be able to read the kind of books that they like. The library is where they get the books from. So, just because a parent does not want their child to read a certain book doesn't mean that the book shouldn't be there. I think that parents need to tell their children why they do not want them to read a book.     If the parents explain, kids will understand why it is not good for them. Those type of books are what older people like and they are very interesting. I think if people understand what the book talks about and if it does not bother them, then they are old enough for it. Also, the young kids that should not be reading these books should have and adult or guardian with them, therefore they can stop the kid from reading something that is not appropriate.     Something else that will bother many people is them not being able to get a book just because parents do not like it. This is taking a right away from us, and we should not have to go buy the book and only read it once. If these books are so horrible than why would people still be writing them? So, if they have not bothered people that bad yet then there is no reason for people to not like it now. People should be able to do what they enjoy and not have that taken from them.     This is my opinion of the statement. Many people @MONTH1 not agree but I just tried to make people to see my point of this statement. Then everyone can help stop people taking things away from the community that makes them happy. Also, I hope people can still have their rights and not let a couple people take it away from them.",4,4
3045,"Should books, magazines, music, movies, and ect. be censored for certin age levels? No they should'ent. Books can be very educational. Sometimes you can't even find a book with out bad things in them. Even if they do, sometimes it's the only way to learn some of the rich history of our country.     Books can't be censored from children. Why you ask? Because the reason people read books is to learn. To learn about love, math, history, and much more. These books are writen by adults, not for adults, but for everyone to read. I read lots of books, and every book that I read I learn someting new.     Back in the ninetinth and twentith centerys, cursing was huge in books. But it wasent just to curse, it was to show the full dioulge of the character. It also set the mood of the era, and the place, where the story is being held. Such as in war books the characters curse a lot. The reason for this is that if a man gets shot in the leg and all he said was,' @CAPS1!!' That isn't how the character would act. The man would curse his lungs out. Not literly but when the author writes what someone would truely say, the reader will have a better understanding of the characters in the book.     As the quote says, everyone has the same right to read, which is true. Its true because everyone has a right to be interested and learn about what they are interested in. Right? I myself strongly belive they everyone should choose what they want to learn about, and then have the freedom to do that.     So should books in a library be censored? No defenitly not. its the best way for people to learn what life is really like. Sometimes you can learn anything with out reading a book with curse words, sex, or violance. People worry that reading books like this will create bad people if they learn these things at a younger age. But it wont, it will only show them how not to act. And can only create a better person.",4,4
4497,"There are many reasons why censorship can be thought of as a good thing, or a bad thing. I am against censorship. My reasons are that just because someting is there that you don't like, doesn't mean that you have to look at it or use it. There are plenty of people that would like to have access to that information or entertainment. Another reason is, that if there's something that someone doesn't  want their child looking at, then they should either trust that their child won't look at it, or prevent them from seeing it. Finally, what would be left if everyone were to remove somthing that they took offense to? Nothing would be left to read, listen to or watch.     First, why I think censorship is wrong, is that the people that take offense to what they want removed, don't have to look at whats offensive. No one is forcing them to look at it or use it. They're better off just ignoring it. Because other people, that don't take offense to it, have the right to look at or use it. The library might be the only place that someone could have access to that sort of material. So if someone were to remove that material, the person that needs or wants it, would not have the access to use it. And they are given the right to use it. Their child might even have the right to it.     Second is that some people wouldn't want their child seeing those things. But removing it shouldn't be that persons first instinct. I believe that the parent should be able to trust their own child not to look at it. And if they can't, then they need to somehow prevent their child from viewing it; not by removing it. The parent should be able to come up with a reasonable way of preventing their child from viewing things that they don't want the child viewing, rather than taking that thing away from the child, and the whole community.     Lastly, let's say that in a library, theres at least one book to each person in a community that offends that person. If they were each given the right to remove the book that offended them, what would be left to read? Absolutely nothing. And each of those people that removed a book, most likely would enjoy another book that someone thought was offensive. So now there isn't a single book for that person to read, just because everyone else disliked the books they didn't think were offensive. Once someone starts removing, other people will join in, and you'd be left with an empty library.      Thats what I think about cencorship. It's really just wrong. Personally, I would like to be able to go to my library and pick out a good book. And I know other people like to do that too. So why should anyone else be able to take that away from them",4,4
4584,"Censorship in libraries has gotten to strict making the next generation miss key lessons learned about life. How would you feel if you went to the library and as an adult would only be able to check out childrens books, magazines, and music? Now i know thats a little extreme but in all seriousness what are we without knowledge? Where would we be if there was no books, magazines, or music left? No libraries means no knowledge, no books, no life lessons, no imagination, and above all no excitement. we would de-evolve back into our animal-like state, because in all actuality we humans have only one thing that has given us the power to become so advanced and smart, our brains. There was once a quote by which i live my life by, it went like this 'if knowledge is power then books must be the means of getting that power'. From my own knowledge and views of the world i will give you my argument on censorships and how they effect libraries.     Censorship, what do we all think of when we as americans say censorship? I think of  bad thing like cuss words,nudity, and battle scenes. The thing about these is they are displayed in different ways such as music. an example of music not being censored would be rap. go ahead get the explicit version of that rap song or sometimes it might already be bad enough. I personnely don't like rap so this opinion is biased, I more like a rock and metal music. people like music and it takes away from our freedom, if you don't like what they are saying just don't listen to it.          Another subject of intrest when we talk about censorship issues is magazines. We all at some point have seen or learned of naughty magazines like playboy. Now im all for making sure those type of magazines stay out of school libraries, but public libraries should have their own adult sections were we might not put playboys but stuff like hunting magazines,or hot rod magazines line the adult sections shelves.      The last thing that is subjected to rather extreme censorship is books. Lets be honest we all had a favorite book when we were little or as we grew up. One such book that is an absolute classic is 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' its currently being removed because it has like one or two cuss words in it. I mean really people its a great book but at the first sign of a cuss word everbody starts shouting burn it. Now many of the following generations will never get to read that classic because people took it out of libraries. i feel that people should learn to relax andnot fret over one or two cuss words because that is apparenly all it takes to ruin a great book.     So whats my final conclusion? when does our first amendment right to free speech with censorship and too much censorship meet? Apparently in libraries where one can't read @ORGANIZATION1, wood craftmanship, or listen to music that involves cuss words. In my personnel opinion i think that adults should have their own section uncensored, teens should have only censorship on things like nudity, and children well they are just right on this subject no more censorship is needed. So i ask you, the one who grades my essay to just stop and think with an open mind how long do you hide your children or your grandchildren form the real world. In the real world these things are deamed acceptable if they weren't exceptable they wouldn't be out there to begin with. Truly if you decide to take out classics like @PERSON1 we lose not only knowledge and the story we lose our freedom",4,4
3033,"Why should we be more carefull of what we get at the libary? Libaries can have books with knowledge, fun, rommance, and action or adventure, but some can be desterbing and grusium. Kids a lot of times will pick books that have pornagerfy or grusium action. This causes the kids to act in different ways. They act hyper and mean to other people or even other children. They are sneeky and do things behind the parents back. Why is because they think they need to act this way because its cool, but they don't understand this makes them look very ugly. 'So take them out' is some of the parents are saying now a days.     Even if we do take out all the books that can be bad for our children, there will not be a lot of books left. Because now a days all books have something that is bad for our mind. So why do we need to be more carefull with the books we put in our libary and the books we take out of our libary? It causes the world to change very fast.     Now libarys are a great place for kids to learn. Books can teach them new things and expand their knowledge. The libary is where all kids that have reports or essays on important people come to. Some kids go there just to get a book to enjoy. From my point of view libary is one of my most favorites places to be. Any where there are books involved count me there. Having books causes our imagination to come out and take us on adventeres that some of us will never get to do.     Sometimes books can cause things to happen in families. Some of them causes us to have nightmares or have very bad behavior. If we try to take out some of these books it will help the familes to come together, but also if we don't take out some of the books, it will cause things to go wild. Because people and kids think they need these books to survive in the world. Which really its just  the books and ect... that causes our mind to picture things that make us think we need them.      Other writing materials and even movies cause problems in this world today. Magazines can have girls with not much clothes on or other things that make boys minds wander. Movies are even worse because the picture is right there in front of their faces. I am not saying all magazines and movies are bad to our mind because they can also be helpful. Magazines can help us with research or just to now what is happening in this world today.      They also can talk on many subjects like cooking, room decerating, on how to decerate your weddings and etc... Movies can help us research and also show us what happened back then. Like watching docromentries, they are on people or what happened in our past. We don't need to take every movie or magazine out, but some we can do without.      So why do we need to be more carefull for what we put in libaries? It can cause us to have bad behavior or bad dreams. So how can we help to solve this problem? We can take out  books, magazines, movies and etc... that are really bad for our mind. So it can help our children to grow up well behavied and mature. Also one more thing books, magazines, and movies can be a very good thing if we use it right. How do we know we got a good book? We find right books for us by following our heart and our instinkes",4,4
4218,"Materials that are found offensive should not be taken off the shelve. People might need those materials for research or if they just want to find out about something. If the material is offensive to someone they can report it but the people that work at the library might not do anything about it. The people that find something offensive could also ignore it and walk away.     If I found something that was offensive to me I would just ignore it. I might look at it to see what it says but I would not say anything about it. There are some people that would have to look at that for research or something else. So why get it removed from the shelve? I have not seen anything that would be offensive to me yet but, if I did then I would not say anything. Now some people would say something but, what if you walked in a library looking for a book for your research paper, and it was not there because someone found it offensive? What would you do? Yes you could get on the internet but, it might not have what you are looking for exactly.     I have had a lot of research papers. There was one time when I went to the library and could not find a book or a magazine to help me with my research. I had to wait for over an hour just to get on the computer to look information up. When I did get on the computer I only had an hour to look up everything. I did not get it done in time and had to turn it in late. Computers are good for looking up stuff, but when you have a book in mind that would give you a lot of information, you go for the book not the computer.     I know there are materials that are offensive to people. I know people get mad at them but, it is not the librarys fault. They most likely have to have those materials on the shelve because that is whats required of them. So if people do get mad they can report it or just walk away and ignore it.",4,4
4601,"Your @CAPS1     @CAPS2 are many things done and said in this world today that people take offense to.  It could be something someone said about one's relgion, or taking away @CAPS1 of others. Do you believe that books, music, movies, magazines, and articles should be taken off the shelves at stores just because people find it offensive?  I don'@CAPS3 believe it should work that way.  @CAPS2 are a variety of different relgions, races, and beliefs in this world, so if we took something off the shelf everytime found it offensive we would have nothing left to sell.     When it comes to younger children they are not going to know what to think and believe. When seeing and hearing things, children start to believe it.  The media that adults find offensive should not be published and out in the open for children to see and listen to. Even though the kids @MONTH1 not take offense to any of the media, you still have to think about the parents and what they believe is right for their children. Many effects on life are put into the media everyday for everyone to see, and some parents @MONTH1 not find it suitable for their children to be hearing about it.  Drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big effect on children and their lives today. I believe it is our responsibiltyto protect from all harm until they are old enough to fight for themselves, and make their own judgements.     Our religion is a big part of your life because it determines what we believe in, and in we think is right or wrong. Your parents teach you the way they want you to act and teach you the difference between what they think is right and wrong.  I was taught to always be respectful to others and try my hardest in whatever it is I @MONTH1 do.  Some people @MONTH1 have an actor or actress as their role model, so whenever they see that certain person on @CAPS3.V., you tend to think that whatever they do is okay for you to do.  Some parents @MONTH1 take offense to a show on the television because they don'@CAPS3 believe that is right for their kid to be watching.  While others don'@CAPS3 see a problem with it.  So if we cancel that show on @CAPS3.V., you are making one family happy and many others upset. When it comes to the movies, people have their own different ratings for movies, but the state rates them whenever they come out.  Now at movie theaters you must be eighteen to see a @CAPS5 rated movie, or you must have a parent with you because you going by yourself and your parents not knowing get upset those of manys.  With libraries and movie theaters they have what the state thinks is for adults only in their own little section. My parents believe that if @CAPS2 is a law for something it is @CAPS2 for a reason and we are going to obide them.  As with some parents they have their own rules.  Such as some parents think it's okay for their children to drink under age as long as they stay home with them and they know what is going on.        A few years ago my little cousin was watching a movie with me that was rated @CAPS6.  I didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it and just turned they movie on and we watched it.  It had a few words in it that his parents didn'@CAPS3 agree to him watching, and he really liked the movie.  His favorite quote from the movie was something his parents did not want him hearing at his age.  He didn'@CAPS3 know any better and since he thought it was so great, he was walking up to people saying that quote.  His mother was not happy and asked where he had heard it from and he told her the movie, and she didn'@CAPS3 think that he needed to be saying that and he got in trouble.  I told her it was my fault, I let him watch the movie and didn'@CAPS3 think anything of it because my parents let me watch it when I was his age.      It just comes to show that, @CAPS2 are many different things in this world today that not everyone is going to agree on.  So if we took something off the shelf because someone took offense to it, we would have nothing left in this world today.  We learn about the things we do in life because the state has requirements that have to be passed.  What we learn outside of school is up to your parents based on what they believe.  So if @CAPS2 is something out @CAPS2 you don'@CAPS3 believe in stay away from it, and let those who do believe in it enjoy learning about it",3,3
3121,"I, personally, do not think that books, music, movies, or magazines should be removed from the shelves because they are found offensive. However, I do believe that there should be a way to protect adolescent, still-developing children from reading books that @MONTH1 offend them or introduce them to new concepts or ideas that @MONTH1 hinder their educational growth. Some kids who have not been properly educated over a controvercial topic (such as drugs or alcohol) @MONTH1 make a bad decision based off something he or she reads about in a book or on a webpage.     To help solve the problem of offending children or deterring their education, I propose that we make a book 'rating' system. Similar to rating a movie or a video game, this system would rate the book so that readers know what age level the book is apropriate for, and state what factors the book incorporates to rate it the way they did.     As a newpaper company, you obviously know about our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2. We, as @CAPS3, have @CAPS2. One of them being freedom of speech, along with freedom of press. With that said, I do not think that taking books labeled as 'inappropriate' off the shelves is a reasonable solution to the issue. I know, that from personal experience, when someone tries to take away my @CAPS2 that I'm entitled to, I get extremely angry. Authors, editors, photographers, and publishers all go through a lot of hard work and long hours to put these books on the shelves. By taking the books off the shelves, I believe that that would be repressing their @CAPS2 as @CAPS3. I know that if I were an author, and my book were taken off the shelf, because someone found it 'inapppropriate' I would be very upset. Taking books off the shelves could possibly cause an author's strike, to protest until their books are allowed to be enjoyed by anyone who wishes to read them.      However, like I mentioned in the second paragraph, I do think that making a rating system for books is a good idea that allows the authors to express themselves fully, and also allows readers to know what controvercial material is in the book without them being affected by the information they would have read without the warning. I would strongly advise you consider my proposal, because it has the potential to prevent future confrontations between authors and the public.",4,4
4751,"I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from shelves at a library if they could be found offensive. It is good to be unique, and no matter how innapropriate a subject might be, it is still factual and helpful in learning. If anything they should just put a label on the cover of the book that says somthing along the lines of 'adult content.' @CAPS1 repeats it's self, and this quote reminds me of periods in @CAPS1 where we need to learn from our mistakes, no matter how bad the subjects are, such as the @CAPS2, and the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 in the deep south.      What about the @CAPS2, when @NUM1 million @CAPS7 were killed because they were @CAPS7. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 find these books offensive but that doesn't mean the @CAPS2 never happened. There are many offensive and contraversial pictures and stories about events that happened during the @CAPS2. Even though this is a very depressing and horrific subject, it is still good for our @CAPS20 to learn about what happened. And other catagories need to be read because it can help @CAPS20 to understand right from wrong, and help prevent them from making big mistakes in the future.     The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 started from the @DATE1's all the way until @CAPS13 @CAPS14 @NUM2. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 took a toll on everyone in the @LOCATION1A, but some people couldn't handle it as well as others. In the south, most @CAPS19 treated @CAPS17 @CAPS18 as dirt. They didn't let them in their schools, in their clubs or churches, they were rude towards them, and most horrific of all, they lynched them. There were a set of @PERSON1 called the '@PERSON1,' which pretty much was a list of @PERSON1 to treat @CAPS25 as unfairly as possible. If a kid were to pick up a book or magazine with pictures of lynchings in them, they would remember it their whole life, and if that one picture truly bothered them, they their whole life growing up, they would realize that what @CAPS19 did to @CAPS25 was unethical.          Some books and magazines in libraries are really explicit, but we can't shelter our @CAPS20 their whole lives. Parents need to sit down with their @CAPS20 when they have questions and discuss the truth with them. What are parents going to do when their @CAPS20 go to school and hear other @CAPS20 talk about subjects such as sex? @CAPS20 could get the wrong idea about sex or not know exactly what it is because their parents never actually sat down and explained to them what sex is. I am not saying to go let your @NUM3 year old look at pictures of people having sex by any means, but when @CAPS20 get to a certain age, their parents need to step up and talk to them about uncomfortable subjects such as puberty, sex, and babies.     It is time parents stop hiding the truth from their @CAPS20, or hovering over their shoulders like helecoptors. If @CAPS20 don't learn the truth about the real @CAPS13 and about how many evil and manipulative people there are in the @CAPS13, when they go to college they won't be able to stand for themselves. If @CAPS20 don't learn about @CAPS1 and what all has been done, it is kind of like we are treating the books like the @CAPS7 and the @CAPS17 @CAPS18 were treated. Just because these books are different than others we will just get rid of them, just like how we tried to kill off all the @CAPS7 and @CAPS25 because they were different. And it is wrong and inhuman",4,4
3652,"So you see a nice, old lady looking at one of many books throught a library, she chucks @CAPS4. You look at her, she looks at you, she walks away. You go and pick up the book, @CAPS4's about medical marijuana. She took offense to that? I don't really care what people gotta say, if @CAPS4's on the shelf, @CAPS4 stays on the shelf.     I'm convincing librarians, readers, and everyone else that if you have offense to a book, magazine, movie, or anything you can find at a @CAPS1 library, shut your fat mouths. A library serves many purposes, one, @CAPS4's @CAPS1, itt's open to anyone and everyone. Two, if you have a library card, you can check out books, movies, music, etc. Three, if your walking down the road and 'gotta go,' you can stop right in and leave.      What I'm trying to say is that nothing should be removed from any shelf at any library. Yeah, I mean there's a certain point at which you got to take charge, but even then you can have an adolescent room or what not. I think that if you take something off the shelf at a library, you can just taking away part of the heart. Let's say you have @NUM1 @CAPS1 libraries in your town, one library has one thing the other doesn't have. Someone riots and they get to take @CAPS4 off the shelf. Your never going to find that anywhere else unless you buy @CAPS4 off line. And sometimes, that can get a little pricey, especially since you can get @CAPS4 free at a library?      But then again, I see where people are coming from to take certain materials off the shelfs. Say you gotta @NUM2-year old kid, and he walks up to you carrying a sex love book. What can you say about that? I mean in sounds corny but @CAPS4 can happen. Most parents just want to keep their kids in a safe, harmless enviroment. That's where they come in and say, 'I thought this was a @CAPS1 library?!' Then that's where @CAPS4 goes bad.      After all that happens, people just accuse the librarians to @CAPS2 they got these books, movies, and music that's just bad for a young kid. But @CAPS4's not the librarians' fault, different people like different books, that's @CAPS2 a library has many, many choices when @CAPS4 comes to books.      That's when the question comes up, '@CAPS2 don't we just have seperate rooms, for seperate books?' @CAPS3, that sounds good and all, but who's gonna pay for @CAPS4? Libraries get donated alot of their stuff, they are profitable, but then again a non-profitable resource. Libraries have been around for ages, most of them started out small and now are big. That's when the library gets donations, looks through them, and sells the books they don't want or need. They make money off that, that's when they start making seperate rooms.     @CAPS4 sounds crazy, but @CAPS4 wouldn't cause a riot to go on about people. Therefore, people are happy, librarians happy, and most of all you are happy. You can find the book you want or need easy as one, two, three. All you gotta do is go to that certain room, look for @CAPS4, check @CAPS4 out and you got a nice book to be reading anytime. @CAPS4 sounds easier that looking @CAPS4 up, get the dewy decimal number, find the number.      All in all, we shouldn't remove anything from a library shelf bevause @CAPS4 @MONTH1 be the only one in your town, maybe the only one in your state, maybe through the whole country. You never know. All I gotta say is, '@CAPS4's better to keep a book, than to forget a book.",4,4
4084,"Today in our day and age we have books, music, movies, and magazines that say or show materials that young children and teens should not be seeing at their ages. I am writting your newspaper company to tell you that I think the censorship should be implied more in libraries. Their should be something like a warning label on the magazines, movies, music, etc. that the parent has to sign before that says, '@CAPS1 child can see or hear the materials being displayed.'      In this centry we have @ORGANIZATION1 and @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 shows showing violience, sexual content, alcohol, and drugs. Its almost impossible to keep all children away from these things, but we should at least try to. There are shows on @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 now showing teenage pregnencys, and they are pursading the viewers that its okay to have children without being married, or even in a relationship with the person. @ORGANIZATION1 shows are now showing things like stealing in stores and the actor or actress getting away with the prize with no conserquence. Also they have violence and uneeded langauge.      I know from @CAPS1 own experience watching @ORGANIZATION2 @CAPS2 @CAPS1 dad has came into @CAPS1 room, and told me to turn it off. That they shouldn't be allowed to do somethings they are showing the viewers. I know when I am married and have children I will keep @CAPS1 kids away from certain materials as long as I can until they are old enough to understand, and know the right thing to do in the situation. Some of the language they use such as 'retard' I find offensive.      In @CAPS1 opition the censorship in libraries and in households have really declined. Some parents have no idea what their child might be watching behind closed doors. A good parent would make sure that the materials their child is watching is appropraite for there age.      Even books have sexual contact, and language. When I have children I will make sure that they are reading materials that fit them. Magazines these days are even worse. The call the @CAPS7 '@CAPS6 @CAPS7' for a reason, and young teens are picking it up off the shelves at conveniate stores and are reading it. Most music you hear on the radio has some sort of offensive words, refuring to sexual activity, or they are singing about drinking or drugs. Parents need to get more involved in their childrens life, and what they are reading or seeing. I am not saying that all materials need to be removed from the shelves, because some movies or reading materials send off great messages to kids and teens. I am just concerned about some things people can get so easily without any censoring.   I hope you read this essay and really take it into concerderation. I hope to hear back from you soon. Thank you for your time",4,4
4081,"Do believe that any boook or form of literature should be removed from a library just because someone takes it into offense? No, it should not be removed. That person should clearly just not read the book or let their children read the book. They have a problem with the book, not everyone else if the book was good enough to be published that means someone wants to read the book which means they would make others who want the book upset over their own opinion.       In the words of Katherine Paterson, a famous author, she says,'All o fus can think of a book that we hope none of uor children or any children have taken off the shelf. But i fI have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she means by that is everyone has their own opinion on every piece of material that hits stores and libraries. If we shall let everyone choose to take these materials off the shelf then we might as well have no books, music, movies, magazines, etc at all because someone somewhere will always not like the material.     If someone finds something offensive they should simply stay away from it. Everyone has their own view of everythings they come across which means if you hate something, your neighbor might love it. So simply because the boo or other form of material offend you that doesn't mean that its worth taking off the shelves of libraries and book stores.     Don't get me wrong I believe in some forms of censorship. I just don't believe in people taking their opinion and choosing whether a certain piece of literature or music can be in our libraries. I just believe that our libraries are a place where authors can express themselves and share their book, novels, poems, etc.      I believe that if something is offensive to you that's your opinion and there's an easier way to not hav eyour children read the than getting the book removed, just don't bring the book to your children stay away from the book as much as possible. If you @MONTH1 come across it just don't acknowledge it. Your children are more at risk of being in a carcrash then reading a nonapropriate book only if you teach them correctly, not to sound harsh but to shine reality on the fact. That is why I do not believe in censorship in libraries nor bookstores",4,3
4731,"i think that if there are offensive books, music, magazines, etc then they should be put in a section of their own, or the librarians should have them kept up and if someone needs/wants them then they would have to go to the front dest in order to get them. i think also, if a young child or teenager cant see, read or hear those types of things than they should not be in there period",2,2
4055,"Most of us have had times when we are really into a book or magazine that we are reading, and all of a sudden we come across vulgar language, pictures, or activities that are not suitable for us. Why did the author have to throw this in the book? Why didn't the back of the book tell me that there was offensive behavior in this book? Why is this magazine in the library with risky pictures? It @MONTH1 even make some people not interested in that specific author anymore, or quite possibly persuade someone to stop visiting that library. Certain materials in libraries should be removed.     The first reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because it is not suitable for children or even young teenagers. Let's say your child is at the library and they pick up a random book to check it out. Turns out, the summary of the story on the back is actually about college kids partying and participating in illegal activities. Your child on the other hand, does not read the summary and just wants the book based on the moral of the story, interesting cover, and critic reviews. If your child reads that book with vulgar language and illegal activities, you are most likely going to be upset.     The second reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the books and other materials with offensive material can be placed in book stores, instead of the public library. In that case, parents can feel more content with having their children read any material at the library. Adults and older teenagers can still have their material choice, they will just have to take a trip to the bookstore to find what they need. They @MONTH1 not get to check out items for free like at the library, but it will be safer for the children and young teenagers. Not to mention, the people who respect their morals too much to read offensive material.     The third reason certain materials in libraries should be removed is because the library should be ordered to state on the back of the book, magazine, movies, etc., in any way they choose, if the book contains anything that @MONTH1 be taken as offensive to a reader. That way, if someone is questioning the summary of the book, a risky title, or cover illustration, they can flip to the back to see if it will be tolerable for them.     Libraries should remove certain materials from the shelves. It will create a more civil trip to the library. No more worries about accidentely coming upon a sentence or chapter in a book that is against someone's morals. Or flipping through pages in a magzine and seeing a picture that offends you. Libraries will contain safe books for all ages, while bookstores can have the pleasure of having offensive material on their shelves. It's a win win situation.",4,4
4002,"Libraries should or should not have books, music, magazines that are found offensive? Some people like things that are different than what you or anyone else like you @MONTH1 think some of the things are offensive, but yet again something you don't like someone else @MONTH1 like, and want to read. Would if be fare to you that you like something, and want to read it, but someone else dose not like, and thinks that it offens them, and they should take it off a shelf at a public library because of what that person said.      I don't think that thinks like that should be taken off a shelf for something like, becasue there could be a person in school that needs soemthing like that is not right for a child to be looking at,but what if there is a kid in high school or collage that needs a book to do a project over that type of things, but also yes I do think that things that little kids should not be looking at or listening or reading something like should not be able to get a hold of because parents should not have to worry about them going to a librariy, and there children see something that they do not want them to see. There are vary many ways that people that work in the libraries can keep things up from children that is to little to see or hear what there parents do not want them too. Some ways that you can do that is by putting all the books and music that is like that in a section of the library that you have to be a sertent age to be able to go look or listen to them.      Lubraries are for everyone no matter what you look like or dress. You as a person has the right to go in to a public library and look for something to read no matter if it has some curse words or some violence in the reading. If you are reading those kinds or books you should be machure for your age and not have to worry about it. You hear and see everything that you read about today so I don't see the difference in if a child hears or sees it beacuse you see it just about every where you go now days. You really can not get away with out dealing with it",3,4
4282,"Now days people can get offended over anything. In todays trying time readers, listeners, even wirters, are trying to get what they want not what the consumer wants. Even though some stories, books, or articles, are completly bogus it shouldn't matter. Dont let others opinions ruin it for everyone else.      Many people get offended now days over absolutly nothing; and they feel the need to do somthing about it. whitch nesessarly isn't a bad thing but isn't a good thing either.It is freedom of speach, or so thats what the constitution says, meaning folks have the right to read, write, or say, anything they please.      Fake and bogus writings is a small problem to readers, and writers. People are reading articles, and book and believing every bit of what they read or write or even hear on their radio in recent times. It is hard to believe anything now days, because you never really know the facts unless you experence them your self.      Opinions are the big thing folks have to look out for, but still that goes back to the freedom of speach. Reading, and writing is a wonderful thing to do and has been around longer than any human will ever know. Just don't let other readers opinions get in the way of a great thing",3,3
4587,"Most people have been debating on whether or not to stop giving out books, movies, music, magazines, and so on, if they are  disturbing other peoples lives, and offending them to the point where they are getting infuriated, and disturbing the peace. I also think that many people have been complaining about the violence in the community due to several disturbing books, music, and so on. But I would have to say that most people live off of or get entirely influenced by what they read or hear. I think that this accomnomy should get over itself and learn to live their lives. I personally do not think that anybody should be punished for what is being put on the library shelves, stores, like music for instance. I do not think other people who actually enjoy reading and listening to that stuff, if they are happy then so be it then they are happy. I do not think that people who actually enjoy reading, and hearing what is disturbing that Other people should be punished just because somebody else does not like what they are hearing or reading. Why should things that bother other people be removed when they are not hurting anything or anybody. I personally, in my own opinion think that would not be fair. because, in my experience I do not think people should complain. What is in these stores only makes us stronger.",2,3
3931,"My opinions on the censorship in libraries are that libraries are great places to get information on books such as biographies, fiction, nonfiction, science fiction, and other genre books. I don't believe that books, music, movies, magnizines and other things should not be removed off the shelves because people love music and they want to get information about the artist who made the songs and information about the artist. Also people want to learn the lyrics to the song.     The reason why books shouldn't be removed off the shelves is becuase people enjoy reading books and they want to know what the book is about and have some information about the book. Books are very important to people and need some entertainment other than television. Also people used books to study for the book is going to be read and then going to be tested on. The books that are found offensive should be removed because people get very upset if they find out that the book is talking bad about them. Unless some people are not mature at all and can't read books that are not even talking about them.     Movies shouldn't be removed off of shelves because people love watching movies and they are very entertaining to them. If a movie is very offensive to the people, yes it is probably best to remove the movie because they don't want to watch it anymore. But other movies are not even bad. Yes some movies have foul language but people still enjoy it. But sometimes in movies people hear something from the movie and they spread it around the @LOCATION1. Then everybody starts saying the foul language. People just have to learn how to not use foul language when not needed.     Magazines shouldn't be removed because people love reading magazines especially sports related. I know I love reading sports magazines because I am a very true sports fan and sports are very important to me other than school. There are very inappropiate magazines that children shouldn't be reading and they should be removed off of shelves. Magazines are also used for different things such as comics, housework, as for ladies makeup, perfume, etc. People think that magazines are very important to the society",4,4
3178,"We all enjoy having the freedom to read, listen, and watch what we like. How would you feel if that freedom was taken away from you?  Some people believe that censored books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from libraries. I believe you should have the right to read, listen, and watch whatever you choose, but children should talk to their parents about it first if it is a censored material.      We all know that not everything is okay for certain age groups to read, see, or listen to. That does not mean that the item should be removed completely though. Instead, the child should talk to a parent about the censored item. The parent can decide if the child is mature enough for the item. Also, if those materials are removed from libraries completely, someone that is mature enough to be reading, listening, or seeing it will not have a chance to.      I remember when I was in middle school, I really wanted to read @PERSON1 novels that I saw at the library. My mother believed that I should not read those novels at that age. My mother and I worked out a compromise that I could read @PERSON1 novels that she approved of. She said when I was older, I could read any of @PERSON1's novels that I wanted. I found this compromise to be very fair. I knew that when I was old enough to read those novels, they would still be there on the shelf waiting for me.     We should have the right to read, listen, and watch what we enjoy, but younger children or other age groups should be monitored. That does not mean we need to completely remove those materials from libraries though. When those children are old enough to read, watch, or listen to those materials, they should be able to go to the library, knowing it will be there on the shelf waiting for them.",4,3
2997,"I think that all the bad books should be taken out of a library. All the bad books, music, magazines and movies no one really wants to read. If a kid picks up the book and reads it, and there are bad content in the books, magazines, music and movies that would be bad to read. If they are young enough and they don't know if the movies or anything else in the library are bad, then it's the library's fault for letting them get the book movies, music or magazines. If the parent doesn't know that their kid read the book their parents will be wondering where they got bad phrases from. There are people that think that any libraries should have any bad books.     There are many things in books that parents don't want their children to read. There are things like books that talk about sex. There can also be language that the kids should not read. I know for sure, that I don't want my kids to read anything bad when they grow older.         There are also music that parents don't want kids to listen to. There is things like sex songs. There are also things that don't say sex directly, but imply it. I never want my kids to listen to bad songs like that, I want them to be responsible and not listen to terrible songs.     There is also movies that I don't want my kids to watch, because of the content of the movie. There are so many things in this world that contain bad things, which all have something to do with sex. Latly all the movies that came out are very inapropriate.      Their is one more thing that I think is very important, which is magazines. There are many things that can happen in magazines like porn. I hate when kids are tempted or forced to look at porn. I think in general we should get rid of porn, and descusting pictures in magazines.",3,3
3933,"Having libraries is a good thing because it teaches children to learn how to read and get examples from the book or magazine that they are reading or just looking at it. How can they help with children and family memebers that hardly ever knew how to read and write about them. Some libraries have shelves some of them dont that is crazy but silly to.Libraries have books and magazines that is for children and also for adults and even grandparents. How can they tell if there is a position that you have to put your books on bookshelfs and on a cart. They would have to have alot of respect and also alot of body work to put the things that need to be in the library. Librarians can have more than just books they can have cds, computers, and also a table that has coloring pages for children.I think they need to be removed because i wouldnt want my children going in the library and finding a whole bunch of stuff that they dont even know what it is about. This would be a wonderful thing to do they should not have stuff like that in a library in the first place. The librarians should convince the person that brought those in there and tell them to take them back where they got it from.I would think that they should just put stuff that would usually go into a nice and quite place to sit down and read and also there is other options computers to do your homework on. Librarians can have stuff like that that is wrong that children see that all the time this is ridiculas and un called for that can teach  them bad stuff they shouldnt be doing.How can they tell if they shouuld convince them to not have unappropriate things that should not be in a library that children should not see. They could take a book home that they dont even know what it is about or what might be in it that should not be in it. I think they should just take everything that is approprate and just send it somewhere else where it belongs instead of where little children can reach and learn whats going on.",3,3
4019,"The shelf is an object that holds many types of diffierent materials such as movies, books, magazines, and music. Its all media and entertainment. But not everyone likes the media because one or all of these materials @MONTH1 be offensive towards the foriegn and children.     Censorship in our libraries could get a little graphic and such. Yes we all the it in movies and music, but we do not want it in our libraries. A library is a place for study and learning for educational purposes. There are not for entertainment and things of that nature. Sometimes they could be a little fun but for the most part, people would like to take there children and show them something to help there minds focus on school. By all @CAPS1 rated @CAPS2 movies, dirty music, adult books and magzines should be taken off the shelves.      One day as I was in the state library looking on the shelves for a book on @LOCATION1 and its people. As I was reading the book, it said some very mean and offensive things about the @CAPS3 people. I thought to myself that this book should be takken of the shelves forever and never seen again. It shocked me that someone would put that book in a public library and let the foreign and others read it. After some people read about the @CAPS3 people; They had second thoughts and started get angey and disliking them for theses things and offensive comments made!     Magazines and movies should be taken of the shelves in the catagories in my opinion of the poeple in different countries and the way they live. That could be very sad for someone because they could of really went through everything in that movie or what ever that magzines says. Another reason censorship should be under control is the titles to these materials. If a child looks at an adult film and it happens to be for a child, wouldnt you think thats a little offensive? I know I would. There is no way I want my child watching some violet movie.      We have to think for our children and the people that come in form different countries when it comes to public libraries. If censorship is not observed carfully then we could make the foriegners very angry or make our children become very violet and reckless because of the films on the shelves, and the people that come in to our country would never come back if they picked up the book that they might of thought that was int interesting but turns out to be very offensive in there opinion. Censorship is very imprtant in libraries and on the shelves",3,3
3425,"I believe everyone has their own choice when it comes to taking a book off a shelf. You should know what your picking up. If you think it might be offensive to you, then set it back on the shelf. It's as easy as that. Taking offensive articles off shevles of libraries just because a couple of people are unhappy ruins everyones opportunity on maybe finding what they were looking for.     Censorship in libraries is just uneeded. Everyone should be able to take care of themselves. Read the title before you pick up the book. It could give you a good hint on whether or not it might offend you. Children on the other hand should be overlooked by an adult just to make sure they dont pick up anything that should not be viewed as a child.      Taking offensive articles off the shelves ruins good books for everyone else. Not everyone is offended by the same material. For some it @MONTH1 be pictures. For others it could just be words. But this offensive material happens in everyday life throughout the world. It just can not be avoided. So why take it out of libraries.     If it's really offensive in any way put a warning sticker on the book. It will warn people that the book @MONTH1 contain material that @MONTH1 offend the reader of the book. It will benefit both sides of this argument. People will be less offended because they won't unexpectingly pick up a book and be offended. But the people that @MONTH1 enjoy reading the offensive books still can read them.     Everyone has their own choice when it comes to picking up a book. You should have an idea of what your picking up. Just because you made a mistake and picked up an offensive article, why take it away from others that @MONTH1 enjoy reading them. Everyone is exposed to offensive material through everyday life. So why have censorship in libraries. It's not accomplishing anything.",4,4
3688,"Censorship in libraries? That could be a good and a bad thing. Is it really that big of a deal for kids to see some bad things in books? Will authors remove their books from libraries?     Censorship in Libraries is not as needed as most people think. Children now a days know a lot of things and are intelligent about certain subjects. I understand parents dont want their children to read books containing drugs, @CAPS1, sex, etc. Their going to have to learn about it sometime in their life though. They might as well get ahead start on it now. Young children most of the time are not even interested in going to those kinds of books anyway. If you censor all the books in the libraries then some students would be in trouble on projects they @MONTH1 need those kinds of books for. Say I needed a book on '@CAPS1' for a project im doing in @CAPS2 class. If the books are censored then I would have no sources to get information from.     On the other hand, I can see why adults would want the books censored. No parent wants their child coming home from school talking about sex, and drugs they saw in a book at school. If I was a parent I would be concerned myself. If it's that big of a deal to some adults then what are they going to do when their children see the same stuff only worse on t.v. Commercials about condoms, and advertisements telling them to use drugs/@CAPS1. Atleast with books, the book is teaching you about the drug and how dangerous it is for you.      If one author takes their book off the shelf because they don't want children reading it, then that gives all authors to do the same. Which could mean that we would have no books on the shelves for anybody. Books are a key to learning! We need to keep ALL books in the libraries no matter how explicit they are. Parents should sit down and talk with their children about not picking up those kinds of books if they don't want their child reading them. Yes, I have seen people pick those books up and start making jokes about them, but thats what children do when their immature. You have to expect that from kids now a days. No matter how bad they are their informational books and we need them to learn",4,3
4776,"I do believe that  book, magazines, music, movies and etc., should be taken off a shelf if a person wants to read the book or magazine. If another person wants to read the book or magazine they would just have to wait until the book or magazine is returned to the shelf.  If another person wants to listen to music or watch a movie they should also do the same. Sometimes you just have to sit and think what is books, magazines, movies, music and etc., for and why are they on the shelves for if you can't read, listen or watch them. Book and magazine should be read and not just sit and be displayed. Music should be listen to and movies should be watched.     The reason why I agree with the fact magazines and book should be taking off the shelf  is  because they were made to enterain you. A book or magazine is also made to catch the reader attention. Another reason why I  think books or magazines should be removed from a shelf is to learn new thing. An example of learning new things is when you go to school you pick up the classrooom book you  learn different thing like math, you learn about the history, or you learn about different  thing in english class.  Magazines and books were made so that  different people can  take it off a shelf  and look though it even if they only want to look a pictures if it has picture.     The reason why I think music should be taking off the shelf is to listen to different music such as rap, @CAPS1&@CAPS2, gospel,or @CAPS1&@CAPS2 and soul. Also, I think music should be removed from the shelf is because it was meant to heard. Some music can teach you what goes on in a person life or what goes on in their heads.Music can inspire people in different ways.Music is apart of life and most people in the world like to listen it different people that inspir them.     The reason why I think movies should be taking off the shelf is because it is meant to be watched not just sit and let in movie cover entertain the people. Movies can also inspire different people to do different thing, such as become an actor also. Movies tell different stories such as life stories. Movies also give people something to do when they are bored.     To conclude this all up, take movies, magazines, books and music off the but put them back so that other people can enjoy they thing you read, watched, or listened to. Watching movies and listening to music nad reading magazines and books can help people in life and @MONTH1 also inspire people. They were made for very good reasons so don't put them up just to be displayed. Take them and use them for good you want regret it in the long run. Ya'll be suprised what different things you can learn by reading, listening and watching.",3,4
4438,"Book @CAPS1          @CAPS2 my name is @CAPS3 and I dont think @CAPS4 book's,magizines and etc. should be taken off the shelf because. Book's help people read and concentrate. In my case the more book's the better and these book's have been here to keep us occiupied. Without them we would have no bref discripson or what happened in the past. Book's have alway's been here to support us and every story must have some fun detail. Without book's I don't know what we would be doing without them.                                                                                                            Book's have been the greatest thing in my life and @CAPS5 hurts for us to know that you wan't to get rid of them after, you made us read them when we where kid's so what is the point of getting rid of them when we got this far. In magizine's there's lot's to know about our people and how we live. We have gotten this far to go to the top. At least when we do read we know how to do some certain things For instance, do you remember when you were a kid and you alway's hated reading but now, a whole new change went into your life and you now know what to do. My fravorite book I have ever read was the @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 was inapporite but @CAPS5 also had meanning. We have to keep these stories alive and im not going to let you take the thing we love to do away.               I love book,s and I hate to see them go away. these book,s were here when we were kid's and we have to keep the lagacy up. Reading is the best thing in life and @CAPS5 helps clear our mind's. Thanks to reading I was able to explain to you this much and how supportive I am with these book's. @CAPS5 would devestate our country,states,cities,school's and reading clubs so please don't remove our book's thats all we ask and not only will you make me happy but you'll make our reader's very happy. Thank you for reading this and have a nice day",3,3
3995,"Can you think of a book that you hope none of your children or any other children have taken off the shelf? But if you had the right to remove the book would you? I believe if I found a book, magazine, any type of  music, or a movie offensive I would not remove it, because everyone has a right to their own opinion, even if it is offensive. Also, instead of removing the materials completely, why not remake them into a more suitable manner to where they are less offensive.     First, noone should have the right to remove materials they find offensive. Because if people were allowed to do that the world would have no music, books, movies, magazines or anything to intertain ourselves. Also it would start a big fight because alot of people do not find certain things offensive like other people do, and when the people that find materials offensive start removing things that other people dont find offensive, a big riot will start.     secondly, why would you start removing materials if it could be remade into a more suitable manner? maybe instead of removing everything, why not find the publisher and see if the could make it @NUM1 or less vaulger. Same with music, movies, and magazines.     So to conclusion everyone has a right to their own opinion, no matter if it is offensive or not. I think if i came across something that offended me I wouldnt do anything about it. Because maybe that person who wrote the book, or movie was expressing how they feel, and you can not tell someone how to feel or express themselves. So instead of removing materials off shelves consider that someone was just expressing how they feel and have the right to their own opinion just like you do",3,3
3028,"Censorship is found on television, in libraries, in schools, and even in homes. Do you think that censorship should be used? Censorship can be used to block one's personal thoughts and opinions to promote conformism. I disagree with the idea of Censorship. Not everyone thinks people should be able to have their own images and visions; however, that is what makes our world so individualized.     Censorship in libraries is growing more and more gradually. The government does not want the society, especially the youth, of @LOCATION1 to read things that are deemed inappropriate. Should that not be up to one's guardian, or if they are old enough, to oneself? When you read books, you see language being block out, they take parts out to make the book seem more classy, also they block out things such as drugs and alcohol. A lot of people believe that books are what hurt a lot of today's society. I believe that reading material could be a lot more educational if the editors woud leave some of the things that they censor, in the book. I believe this because, if parents decide to not let their child read a story that is up to them; however, their child could learn about certain situations and possibly learn how to handle those difficult things.     This opinion that censorship in books could be absolutely debatable. Censorship such as in the book, @ORGANIZATION1 is being used. The government is taking out certain words in this story because they are seen as offensive. This is understandable also. I do not believe this amazing novel should be seen in this way. The language was not meaning to be used offensively, but simply to state how people talked and how things were when @PERSON1 was alive. If it were not for books like this, how would out society learn about not only @LOCATION1's history, but other culture's history? In all fairness, @ORGANIZATION1 is an educational novel about how times were in the day of @ORGANIZATION1 and @CAPS1.     Censorship in movies is also growing. Television will block out things such as language, nudity, alcohol, drugs, and things of that nature. I would not like to turn on the television and see these things everywhere, but it could educate people on what and what not to do. I believe if censorship were not used, people's thoughts would be more apt to imagine. Imagination can scare people. Some think that imagination can turn someone crazy or into doing something that is not normal; but what is normal? It is to the community, doing what everyone else is doing and not being different, this scares people.     This whole essay brings me back to the thought that censorship is basically conformism. The word conformism means to all become one; to conform. If this is the case no one will ever come up with new books, music, movies, magazines, or ideas; we will all just be citizens of @LOCATION1 or any other culture trapped inside our very own minds",5,4
3449,"Many people find certain books, music, or magazines offensive or inappropriate for some young reads. Many people think that this material should be removed from libraries completely. People think that have young people exposed to this offensive material will effect the choices they make, and how they will react in certain situations. At the same time other people say that we should not remove it from the book shelves. They say that everyone has the right to read or listen to whatever he or she wants to. Its that persons right to choose weather or not it is age appropriate for them or not. Its not some elses right to take away choices that aren't theirs.     People who belive that they should remove this material from libraries think it will corrupt young minds. They believe that this material will convey a message that it is alright to do what these books and music are saying. This in turn will create a different mind set for the young reader. Which @MONTH1 cause the young reader to be more aggresive or more like to make bad decisions about there well being or the well being of those around them. These people want there libraries to be about learning and be a healthy eviornment were young minds can grow naturaly and unharmed by offensive material.     People who believe that they should leave this material on the shelf say its no one elses right to make this decison for you by removing them. Its the readers right to choose weather or not to read the material. The read will most likely learn what the material is saying regaurdless of weather it is in the library or not. They believe that it would be better for a young reader to learn about it in a safe enviornment then to have some one else later in there life show them or tell them. The enviornment maybe alot more dangerous then a library if learn though some one else.     I believe in both in a way. I believe it is not some one elses right to remove these books from libraries. But i also believe that it should not be avalible for young readers to get. These books maybe be offensive to some people but its there choice to read it. They do not have to read these books it does not affect them. I believe the books not suitable for young readers should be placed on either a higher shelf or in a different part of the library where young readers do not have acsess to. If a readers parents want them to learn about it in a safe enviornment then they should sit there children down and explain it to them themselves. In the end we all have our rights and we use those to choice weather to read or listen to certain material. It is no one elses choice besides your own.",4,4
3043,"This is what's wrong with today's society. We are too soft.We're too worried about what other people might think if we say this or do that. I'm the kind of person that doesn't care about other peoples feelings. And I say that to an extent. If we're talking about my friends, family, my girlfriend, that's totally different. I show a lot of respect to those people on a daily basis. But as far as people I don't know, I could care less what their beliefs, opinions, and outlooks on life are. Maybe we should stop worrying about other people for once and just try to grow and prosper as a race.      Anybody ever think of that? If I had it my way, the @ORGANIZATION1 would not exist. @CAPS1, radio, books, movies, magazines would all be uncensored. Is life filtered and censored? Absolutely not! So why should those things be? I'm sick and tired of people constantly sheltering their children from lifes normalcies. They've gotta learn sometime. Life isn't lollipops and rainbows. It's hard, unforgiving, and it kicks you in the teeth. You've just got to learn to adapt to it. And censorship in libraries, on @CAPS1 etc, won't and aren't helping matters in the least bit. I guess I don't understand why we have to care so much. If everybody just relaxed a little and focused on themselves, we would be fine. Everytime I hear the word 'offensive' it makes me sick to my stomach, because in my eyes, that word doesn't exist. It's a made up word that really means we care about other peoples feelings more then we do our own",3,3
3039,"I think that everyones opinion is different about some books getting removed from the library.     Do I believe that certian books should be removed from the library: yes and no. The reason why I choose yes and no is because some books are helpful to others for there class and their research for whatever class they need it for. Another reason why I say no is because of the fact, if the book offense you then dont read the book or think about what is says just leave it alone.     The other reason why I picked yes is because if it shows some hurtful words in there towards other thats refering to the people thats its talking about then yes it needs to be removed before others start using thoes kinds of hurtfuls words to the piers or  thier elders. If the book contains racial slurs to different races then yes they need to removed asap. If others get ahold of these kinda books then everyone would use them agianst each other which in relsult of that would cause an outbreak of fights people aruging with each other, just pure hate between thoes people using it agianst the different races.     These are my opinions of removing some books that contains hurtful things or meaning in them that can contain voilence in them or call another person out of thier name or race",3,3
3106,"The library is a place of learning, discovery, and knowledge, available to anyone willing to take the time to engross themselves in the rows and rows of information. Including children's books, novels for young adults, @ORGANIZATION1, @PERSON2, music, and movies, the library gives us a magnitude of opportunities to discover something we didn't know before. Although, there are other things that can be found in the library as well. Books including racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments can accidentally be stumbled upon while searching for something else. A parent should not have to worry about their child coming across a book or magazine containing inappropriate things such as this. I believe that offensive books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the shelves of our libraries.      I would like to being by saying that I have an extreme issue with books that include comments, remarks, or names referring to people of a certain race. Imagine if an @CAPS1 @CAPS2 woman brought her daughter of @NUM1 years into the library to find information about a school project. Instead of finding the birth date of @PERSON1, she found a book making fun of @CAPS1 @CAPS4 and calling them inappropriate names. Children should not have to come across a discovery like that in a public facility, where fun and interesting facts should be found; not racial slurs. This type of event could cause serious damage on a child emotionally and mentally. That is why these types of things should be taken off the shelves immediately!     Another issue I have is with sexual content being found in libraries. I do understand that several books contain some sort of sexual content, but I am speaking of a novel describing a sex scene in extreme detail, or images of almost naked women on the cover. If someone is searching for a book of that kind, they can travel to a sex store somewhere nearby and get their fix of sexual reading pleasure. That type of book, however, should not be found in the library. It makes our society look bad and taints our places of knowledge.      Lastly, I would like to express how I feel about offensive religious comments being found in libraries. Every human in the @LOCATION1 is entitled to their own choice of religion. They @MONTH1 practice it freely, which is sadly not the case for others in different countries. If we have an uncommom right such as freedom of religion, then why would we put books in our libraries that include rude comments towards different religions. A @CAPS5 woman should not have to go to a library and come across a book stating her religion is an waste and stupid. This is not the truth, and it should not be in our libraries!      Even though I feel this way about inappropriate books, I understand there has to be some sort of limit when it comes to censorship. Many people fear once we start removing certain books from libraries, more and more books will be taken from the public until almost all our libraries are empty. Yes, if we do not censor within certain limits, this could happen. This is not what I want to happen though. I simply want the people of this community to stop and consider what is easily available for our children to obtain. The least we can do, as parents, is to take books, movies, magazines, and music containing racial slurs, sexual content, and offensive religious comments out of the libraries",4,4
2988,"Have you seen a magazine, book, movies, etc., that are found affensive? What experiences did you have? Here is my opinion on if I think that those books should be removed or not.       I have noticed that some movies are affensive to other people. Like for an example, the @CAPS1 movies, books is about @CAPS2 and some people don't believe in them or they don't like the movie so I do kind of see no point of making a movie that is about someone that is not real. However, some movies are okay for some people and their age. The movies that are rated '@CAPS3' are for the people who shouldn't be watching it yet like kids under the age.      Magazines though do have some type of thing that I think that is affensive to other people. Like, I don't remember the name of them but they would have sections that would talk bad about another person like one of the kids would talk about the president or something like that. So I think some magazines should be removed off the shelves.      The books however, I don't see a reason why to have them removed off the shelves. I don't think the books seem to be affensive as much as graphical. There could be some books out there that might be affensive to people though, like the ones that talk about a family that has no money or talk bad about them. For an example, you would be able to find a book and read it and find out that it is talking bout things that you don't want to know yet or want to know.      So as you can see I have made an opinion on what they should do either keep the books, magazines, or movies off the shelf. But then I do see it the other way to. Some of us do like those kind of movies or book or even magazines and think that is very cool or interesting",3,4
4697,"I am a student from @CAPS1. I wanted to let you know  that there have been some great and interesting books that I have read from the schools library and the public library as well. The only problem is that there have been some complaints from my friends and families about the books. Not only that but I've also seen books that are not appropriate for children to be reading. I just wanted to let you know this because I was kind of thinking that taking books out wouldn't be a good idea for them to do. I think so because without books less people would want to read and not learn.      To begin with, I wanted to talk about the complaints that friends have told me. One of them was that at the school there had not been good books to read and that they want to take most of them out and replace them with the ones they like. I was thinking that if they did that they would be the only ones to go to the library because it is only there choice and not everyones. So what I'm trying to say is that if we don't have good books students won't be going to the library. If they don't get books then they won't do well in school which is something that will affect the school.     Furthermore about the complaints was that one of my own family member had seen  a young girl looking at a book that was not appropriate for her at the public library. So instead of taking those types of books out they should be put into a room that is strictly not for children to go in. They should do that because if it were to be taken out then that book wouldn't ever be used again. Also another reason is that If they were to be taken out, then another peson might need information over the topic of the book and wouldn't be able to find it because it isn't there. That is why I thing those types of books should be in a special room intead of them being taken out.     Finally, as I had somewhat mentioned earlier is that books are truly important. That is why I go against taking books out that are not favored by others. If a person doesn't like a certain book/ magazine  then they should just request the book/ magazie that they want to read. By doing that then the book that arn't being used could actually be used by someone else that is intersted in it. So if we keep all our book, then more students and people would go and read.      In conclusion, people might say that taking out book is better than keeping them. Well in the way I see it, they are wrong because keeping them is better. It is better because  someday those books can be useful nomatter how old they are. If they were inappropriate books like metioned earlier, they should be put away in a good place. If there arn't enough interesing ones then requesting one is another way to do it. That is why I think that taking out books from the shelves is wrong and they should do watever in order to not let books go to waist",4,4
3642,"Dear @CAPS1 paper,     I for one do think that certain books should be removed from the book shelves at the libraries, but I also disagree with that same situation as well.  For example, I believe that certain books shoud be removed from the library shelves because, under age children also attend the library, and because, other people might find certain books offensive and should not be displaed in a library. My disagreement to the situation is that the its a library, and libraries have different types of books.          First, I think that certain books should be removed from the library because, it a public library and not only adults attend that library, but under age children as well. I know that certain books under age children are not allowed to check out, but they are not deprivcd of their privlliages of staying in the library reading such books.          Next, I do not agree that cerain books should be viewed on library shelves because, other people might find such a book offensive to be in a library. The reson I say this is because some books oppose humor to other people race, and if for say a black, mexican, maybe even a arbiana person was to come in the library looking for a book and happen to fall upon a book that talks about their race, most people would take that offensive.          However, I do not think that any book being deprived from a libray. My reason for thinking that is simply because its a library, and libraries are developed for many peole types of intrest in books. And I don't think it will be fair that certain books should be removed from the library because people think they are inappropraite in certain people interest in books. And people should be free to come in and look at books without having to search for books that interest them but are removed because other people find them offensive.          Therefore, I do and also don't agree that a library should be stripped of a book becuase it lacks intrest in someone or offend someone. And that such a person should 'put the shoe on the other foot' as the saying goes and try to see from other people point of view.",3,3
3317,"Have you ever got or check out a book or something that has been racial to you or you think it should have been censored? I haven't but I checked out a book before that had a lot of racism in it and sex. Im not racist but some people are very racist. Some of the book in libraries aren't sutible for some viewers but yet again the can check it out, some books, movies, magazings, and others should be taking in consideration on being removed so some viewers can't read them.     In libraries there are book that have alot of racism in them. Some racism gets to be very bad in the book and it could intrest and provoke the young viewer to go down that road in a later life. Which could be very bad if you think about it. He could talk his friends into becoming what he is. talk them into becoming racist towards others. No mother or father wants their kids to be racist, but there are familys that are racist. Which i don't get because we are all the same to me.      In some books in the library there is sex talk that accores in it. Sometimes the sex talk gets into great detail which isn't sutible for young viewers, because they could get the idea that they want to try that with someone of a different genger. Which is okay if ur older but if ur really young and reading a book with sex talk in it. Well that's wrong because young kids shouldn't be introduced to that kind of life stile till later in life. Some parents wouldn't like their kids to read that kind of book. I know I won't let me kid read a book like that.      Music is something that everyone listens to, no matter is its rap, country, or the blues. Certain people like certain kind of music. Some people think that rap music is offensive and should be removed off the shelves. Well rap music is based on their past and how their life is. It does have some racism in it like certian rappers say bad words that aren't really sutible for young viewers.      Although some of the racism and cencorship that should be cencored are on shelves, I think it should be in a separete room so only older people can check it out or buy it, instead of the young kids getting a hold of it. I believe that books should have racism in it because it shows how much we have changed from the past",3,3
4030,"I believe that certain materials that seem offensive to certain people should stay on the shelves. I feel like as though its on that person whether they choose to read or listen to the material or not. I have also been in this position where I came cross an article that upset me. Also I have had an arguement once with someone who found what I was listening to was offensive to them.    Once when I was reading a paper on that was making fun of my town that I grew up in. The paper said how my town was filled with rednecks and that many people there were not very educated and not intelligent. This upest me and made me feel ashamed for living there. But I thought more and more that this article was someone elses opinion. That just because they wrote that article, doesn't make it true.    This arguement went out of hand. She had her opinion and I also had mine. My friend came by my house one day to hang out and do some homework. While we were in my room I turned on my favorite artists cd. I listened to rock music at the time and loved how talented the artist was. My friend went to my sterio and turned it off. She told me she didnt like it and that it was offensive music. So after that we pretty much argued the whole time. I finally said that I feel its great music and I shouldnt have to stop listening to it. We had a deal that while she was there I wouldnt listen to it, I felt I would respect her feelings.    Over the past years I have observed that more people are taking what others have to say or sing about to heart. When an author writes a story or an article, they are putting their opinion into it. Sometimes they are typing the facts and also what they feel is write to say. I mean if it is on the shelf and dislike it, dont pick it up and read it.",3,3
4087,"Some people do not like the fact that there are books on the shelf that they consider offensive. People argue to get the corruptive  books, magazines, movies off the shelves. The customers have the choice not to check out the material, it's not their place to try to get the object removed from the shelf.          People that go to the library have the choice to read the book or not, if they have heard bad reviews about the book then they can just ignore it. The books on the shelves in public libraries are there for a reason, and its not to be taken off just because some people dont care for it. Reasons might be that the book goes against beliefs of religion, or just the way those people view things, but that still does not give them the right to remove the book from the shelf.          Everybody has different likeings and tastes when it comes to books. Because a book is not up to one person's standards does not mean that it is not up to another person's. Beliefs and standards differ from person to person and that is why the likeing of books is different to most everybody.          Most people are worried about their children reading the books that they find offensive. If your child is looking for books to read and they pick out one of the books you dont want them reading then tell them that the book is innapropriate. The kid will most likely listen to you and put the book back, that is a much better technique than trying to get the book removed.          Removing a book from the shelf is completely unfair to the other people who visit the library. Everybody should have the right to read what they want and have the choice to ignore the books that they choose not to read. When looking for a book, magazine, movie, etc., and you run across one you find innapropriate then ignore it and continue with your day, it's as simple as that",4,4
3378,"People believe that censorship is impotant in Libraries. They believe that things should not be released if they have a bad subject matter. They feel that it is sending a bad message to children and teaching them horrible things to do and say. I disagree with them on this and these are the reasons why.     I feel that books/music/movies/magazines shouldn't be taken off the shelf is they have cuss words inside, i feel that they should continue to sell them even if they have bad words inside. I feel this way because there are alot of horrible things in this world. Children have to learn that, and i feel like cussing or anything of that subject matter isnt that big of a deal there is so much more to worry about then a couple of bad words children read and listen to. I listen to music that has cuss words on the inside and i also read books with bad words and it doesnt infulence me in any kind of way. So we shouldn't always try to control every one we should just let them be on the shelfs and let them or there parents decide if it's innaporpate or not.in conclusion i feel again that they should be on the shelfs and people should be allowed to listen/read whatever they want to. if it doesnt harm anyone or themselfs then let it go on and happen. let them do what they want to",3,3
4363,"have you ever think about why teenagers are changing each day? sometimes parents don't pay attention why is that happening, because they think their kids are wroging up or because they need more freedom or even because they need more time.  when the time pass they stop and think what happend to my kids why are they changing to much? but they don't know why we bahave like that. you have ti stop that, because we are changing because of what we see on magazines, movies, and books, and also music; sometimes music have offensive words that we learn.                but also music, books,magazines, and movies are good, but when they don't have offensive words or bad things in it. sometimes they affect us in a good way but the majory of the time they affect us in a bad way because we learn bad things. sometimes little kids read books whit bad and offensive words.          i remember when my friend and I were @NUM1 years old she started reading books with offensive words, and her mom got mad at her. after that she started insulting her mom and calling her names and her mom was feeling bad, but she didn't know why her doughter was acting bad. the next day i went to their house and i told her mom that she was reading bad books and watching movies with offensive words, and i told her mom where she was hiding all thoes books and movies.        when she got home i was there and her mom had all the books and movies on her hand and she give me a bad look and she told me that i was a bad friend because i told her mom, i started crying becuase she make me feel bad but she didn't know that i was doing it for her on good.           before i move to the @LOCATION1 she went to my home and she said 'I am sorry because i treated you like that', and i told her that i did it because i loved her and because she was like my sister since we were little. we started crying; now we still best friends. this days, little kids now everything and it is because of what they watch and see.            you can help us by taking all of the bad words and offensive words of the books, movies, and magazines. help us to became someone important in life.",3,3
3362,"Dear @CAPS1:     Have you ever seen an offensive book on a shelf in a library? Would you want your children influenced by these findings? These are the question you need to ask yourself about certain materials that appear in libraries.      As a concerned citizen I am writing to you to relect my opinion on censorship in libraries. In my own personal experiences I have come across magazines, books, and music that are offensive. I believe that these materials should not be found in libraries. There are many people that still would want these materials, so my suggestion is that there should be a seperate room for the offensive materials. If there was a seperate room, we can keep these materials away from young kids. When I get older and have children, I believe that the library should be a kid friendly place. In order to make that happen we need find a place for these materials or not have them at all. Libraries need to be somewhere were anyone can go: a college kid trying to prepare for a test, a young child wanting to discover @PERSON1, or a old man wanting to enjoy the peace and quiet. The distraction of offensive materials are not needed in a library.       Libraries are places to learn and explore the different sources that are inside. For young children it is the fairytale land where anything is possible and the unimaginable can become true. If there are materials that adults do not want their children to see, they @MONTH1 not be comfortable having their child there. Libraries need to be kid friendly places, so that all the ages can enjoy what it has to offer.       As you can see, offensive materials should not be in libraries. All ages should be able to enjoy what a library has to offer, and with some materials that is not possible. Please consider the following.      Kind regards,         @PERSON2",4,4
3653,"Maybe, to a sense I do not think that boo'ks should be removed to an extent. The reason for this is becasue that some books, magazine and other stuff can be informative. They can help you wtih certain questions. They @MONTH1 not always answer what you need but they are there to look back at and see what type of generation we have.      But, there is also other reasons things that can be offense to others. People @MONTH1 take that aspect to the next level to where they are getting hurt. I think that maybe certain books and magazines should be removed. They tend to do damage to others and can hurt other poeple. The sense of this nautre is to ask the store to remove the books or magazine. The store can not take the books off the shelf if one person is offended by the book.      If you take every offensive book of the the shelf then you will not learn from the other mistakes it has taken on other peoples lives. They maybe think it would be a good idea to books off the shelf but younger adults could not learn the mature items that the parents do not want to terach. They @MONTH1 think they are doing t the right thinking by not showing you sexual offenive stuff. You @MONTH1 not want kids or others to see this sexuality and see what the world is becoming.      Also, I can see why they would want to take that stuff off the shelves. They @MONTH1 not like what they see but they think it is the truth and is very offensive to see the sexual, mental illness people have. Certain books @MONTH1 stay on the shelf such as a @CAPS1 book. @CAPS1 books so the human body they do not hid the human body we should know about the human body. So the @CAPS1 books and magazines should stay on the shelf. If you want to look at naked provakadive stuff then go to a sex store. Do not put out books in public that can show the sexually side of humanbeings.     The @CAPS1 magazines are there to learn not for enjoyment. You can go to a different store for enjoyment. But, if you take off stuff that can be offensive to others then that means you would have to take off the @CAPS1 items. People could get offenive by not looking like the poeple in the magazine. That could offend them so would you take it off the shelf or not. Not you would not becasue a @CAPS1 book is there for you learning envoirment not to ofen you. That also could go for the sexual magaizes. Yes, sex is good for you but would you want to teach that to ounger kids that fast. You would want to teach them about sexual introcourse not a magazine. I know that @CAPS1 books and tapes can be incouraging sex but they are mainly talking to adults.     As far as music and tapes go no I do not think that those types should be removed. That is for enjoyment and people liek to relax to this sorta stuff. I mean I do not buy tapes of @CAPS2's or music but othe people do. They enjoy it if you did take it off then what else would they put up? You have to think about the younger generations. The older generations lived a happy not violent life. But, for teenagers now in certain places they have it hard. They need to make a living on the street. They need something to listen to. This offensive music is to listen sure some music is horrible but what music isnt these days.        If music is what you are instersed in then why would we take it off the shelves. People make a living listeing to music and cerating it for others. It is a wonderful thing it really is what makes the world go around. Making stores and stands take the music and newspapers off would be a disappointment to see such a wonderful thing go down the hole because it hurt others.      If you go back to the @NUM1's there music was about drugs as well and nobody ever had a problem about that. Maybe people don't have a problem with it but its becaseu they grew up around it. Just like we have grown up to the rap and the sexual musice. We are teenagers and you were once a teenager. You know you would not be listeing to a beetles song that wouod not be about drugs or sex or getting high. The beetles sang about all the stuff singers sing about now.      Generations change and so does the enivorment but  you can not change they way we grew up. You can try to make it better but it will take a lot of will power. The generations now are tough and they wont let down. You might as well stop trying to take down what we grew up to away from us. Nobody was trying to take away your music so why would you take away ours.     Its not something you want to take away it's somthing you want to look back and see how much are generations have changed from one to another",4,4
3389,"People should not take all the books out for the librarie. Beacuse other peolpe would probley like to look at those books also.  If people start taking books out, all the book  will be gone .So  that would mean  where would be no books form people  to look at. So thats why there should be a law that you can only have a book out for a given period of time . That would help to kept all the books in the liberary.      So if people just start talking the book for the liberary there wont be any book left in the liberary to check out. So there needs to be a law that says that you can check out a sarthen numbers of books at a time. And how long you can have the books for . If you dont bring the books back in a certain amount of time you will be charged. The amount will build up every day you dont bring ther books in. Also if you dont bay the bill you dont get to check out books until you bay the ammount. So that would be a good idea for people not to steal or take the books.     About the Book, moives, and magzines  that are the liberary.   All the books ,moives and magzines should stay on the shelves. Because if you take out one you should take out all off them. Beacuse every one needs to see  these thing in life even if it has some thing bad like a  movie  or a magzine it should stay on the shelves.     So if a book,magzine,or movie gettes taken off the shelfes all of them need to be taken off the shelf .Just becauseit not fare to there author , beacuse they toke time to make what ever they did. If you get them mad thill stop making book for me and you to read.     So thats what I think about the things you should do if you try to take books off the shelf in the liberary.But if its some thing really really bad mabey you should get it taken off the shelfs at the liberary or at any where they sell that book,moive and magzine.",3,3
3231,"I can think of several books that, I would not want a child of mine to pick up and read. I as soon as I seen what I was going to be writing about this one flashed in my head like lighting. The book that @CAPS1 choosing is called '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4.'      The book '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' is about a young girl that grew up without a father. Her mother never wanted to talk about him because, she knew that this way only going to make matters worse. The young girl grew up with the dream of being daddy's little girl.That's all she wanted out of life. She sit and thought is that just a little to much to ask for.      After a few years, had passed by she had finally got the nerve to go on a hunt for father. She went by herself, leaving her mother behind.Her mother always pumped in the head that her father was up to no good. That she would be better off without him there. But, she went on the hunt of her father by faith in the lord.      After saying many prayers to the lord, she finally thought that.She just @MONTH1 knew what this hunt was going to take. So she went to her @CAPS9, hoping that she @MONTH1 just have the anwsers. That she needed to solve her heartace and pain. That she could just walk @CAPS4 knowing that somewhere out there in the world that her father would be waiting for her.       It's was just before the sun was beginning to sit, when she noticed a little old southern bell. Sitting out on the front porch in a wooden rocking chair. She went up to her @CAPS9 and kissed her on the forehead,with tears filled in her eyes.Her @CAPS9 said 'now dear why must you be crying.' @CAPS8, with the lump in the throat she asked 'do you know where I @MONTH1 find my father?' @CAPS9 answered with yes! Dear, @CAPS2's laying down in his bed. That's when her face began to glow.     She went in the old cottage to find her father lying on the bed writing her. She was nervous but with the help of her @CAPS9 she sit and talked with her father.Her father told her that her had wrote her a letter everyday.That's @NUM1 letters a year. She told her father that I've never recieved a letter from you in my entire life span. That's when it clicked to her that @MONTH1 be why her mother never let her check the mail.     After @NUM2 years had passed by she finally found her father. Truth was that her father @CAPS3 out of his daughters life because, the mother didn't want him to be a part of her life. She did whatever it took to keep them apart, even if that meant going aganist law orders. Father explained that her mother needed her there to look after her because, her was into some heavy drugs at the time. Back then there was nothing @CAPS2 could do to take his daughter @CAPS4 from her mother.      The reason I choose this book was because, when I was young my father did the same to me. @CAPS2 left me and I've never had the chance to get to know my family. The pain of growing up without either mom nor dad is tuff. You cry many tears and try to patch up the holes in you heart. Sometime's the bleed still seemeds to find it's way through. After reading the book I always wondered why they called her she. They called her she because, she took the blame for her father walking out of her life.      Many children are growing up without mom or dad. There's a higher percentange of single parent family's now days than before.Just like in the book most kids take the blame for a parnet not being there. If I could take that book off the shelf, then I would because, no child needs to be reminded of the pain they went through.Would you do the same if you were looking out for your child?      All these children want is to know there loved and that someone cares about them.If your going to have these types of books then there needs to be a form for the parnets to fill out giving permission. If they are over age then that's total fine. They're at the age where they should be able to handle it, than going through these feeling alone",4,4
3046,"I belive if the books, music, movies, magazines and etc. are offensive and are bad that they should be removed, the reason being is because of younger children.       Younger children are not aloud to be exsposed to that stuff if it's bad or not pertand to them. Since there are books, music, movies, magazines and etc. that are bad and offensive, then I would suggest a room or some sort of place that they can be held and were only adualts can be around them and can get to them.      Movies and magazines are my biggest thing that would worry me. There are more bad things in them then in books or music. Books and music have bad language but very rarely have bad images or other things like that. If there happen to be a book, music, movie, or magzine that you or any other person thinks that is inaproprete or offensive then you or that person would have permision to take it off and show it the main desk, and let them know what you think about it.     I feel that they should seperated the censorship in libraries to keep the children safe. They should steel be aloud to have censorship books, music, movies, and magazines because adult can handle that kind of material to where younger children can't. So therefore to keep everything sepreate, and there shouldnt be no problem.",3,3
4322,"Do you believe that books or any different materials should be removed from the libraies shelf. No, because them books or materials is not for everybody to look at. Like if you have kid's you should keep them and a kid's area. We cannot just start takeing down every book off the shelf because it was not a good book.The reason why kid's should stay and the kid's area is so they want pick up that book thats not for them. We will need the read to be reading childrens book.If a kid's pick up a bad book you should explaine to them that this book is not for them. Some books are @CAPS1 for kid's to read. so thats why they have there on area to be in. Kid's should not leave there area for a @CAPS1 book. I think that kids should list to appropiate music and a libriary.  The @CAPS1 book or materials are not for the kid's to read so they should not be and that area to pick up a bad book. i feel like there are no bad book out there if you dont like the book maybe someones elese will. but like movies, music, and magazines should not be off the shelf because if it was @CAPS1 it would not be and the libriary and the first place.

These three catagories are very sensitive issues, some @MONTH1 not be comfortable disscussing these issues.      Many books in the library systems today contain foul language. Surprising enough a majority of the indecent language can be found in the young adult section. I don't believe that parents would be very happy to know what their children are reading.     In our modern day world we are bombarded with images of sex and indecency. Books containing obscure acts are no different from television or magazines. Most romance novels are very descriptive and leave little room for imagination, and in the wrong hands can lead to some very prompting questions.      Difference in opinion can be a big problem for some libraries if patrons do not like the message a book sends. Religion, politics, and morals can lead to some nasty debates, but sometimes we have to just agree to disagree.       Can teenagers handle that kind of language and sexuality in a responsible way? Should the books be taken off the shelf just on the basis that we don''t agree with what it says? Should there be a sensor on what can and can't be put in libraries? I dont think that any books should be taken off of library shelves. If you don't agree with the book then don't read it. Instead of blaming libraries for what your children read, perhaps you should look at your own parenting and make sure they arn't reading something they shouldn't",4,4
3571,"In society today, people take things in very many different ways. So things that might help one person, @MONTH1 offend other.      In libraries, there are different kinds of books; fiction, non fiction..(etc). So if you dont like a particular book, maybe you should try looking in a different area. I do not think books should be removed from the shelf because the book has offened a few people.      We are blessed to live in @LOCATION1, where we have freedom of speech. So authors have freedom to write what they would like to. They work long hard hours getting a book ready to be published and then someone wants to take it off the shelf becasue it offened a few people? I do not think that is right.     '@CAPS1 man's junk is another man's treasure.' I think this quote goes along with this topic very well, because the book @MONTH1 not mean something to one person but it @MONTH1 mean the word to someone else.      You never know what people @MONTH1 need to hear. Maybe an alcoholic is at a point in his/her life and is ready to change, and someone has a book about a recovering alcoholic. Now, this kind of book @MONTH1 offend a few people, but it @MONTH1 save a family, a friendship or maybe even a life.      Take @CAPS2 @CAPS3 for intance, her journal is now a book. Now this @MONTH1 offend a few people that might have been thereor maybe don't like @CAPS4 @CAPS5, but her story has the right to be told. Yes, there is violence in it, and i understand that maybe you don't want your @NUM1 year old to hear about how they use to treat @CAPS4 @CAPS7 women, but the story has the right to be told, and should be told.      I do not think that the librarian has the right to take a book off the shelf at the library, just because it has offened a few. There are lots of different kinds of books, if the books you are reading offend you, look for a different type of book",4,4
3170,"I dont think we should not take books, Music, Movies, and Magazines off the shelf gets because we think they are offensive to us. If you think somthing is offensive dont get it I know I would not get somthing that I think is offensive to me.     Their lot's of books in the world that i dont like. One of them is @CAPS1 Books I hate them with all of my heart. The next kind of books that I think is offensive is @CAPS2 Books because their are lots of story that are in their that we dont read. So I think that it is a wast of paper. The last kind of books I think is offensive is @CAPS3 Books because they are hard to read them in @CAPS3.     Their are lot's of music out there I dont like. One of them is @CAPS5. I dont know why I dislike @CAPS5 but I do. The next type @CAPS6- @CAPS7. The singer in todays @CAPS6- @CAPS7 I think are no good. The last type of music is some of todays rap. I think some of todays rap uses to much bad words.     Their are lot's of movies out their I dont like. The first one is @CAPS10 @CAPS11. I did not get the hole plut of that movie. The next one @CAPS12 of the corn. Their was no way I could find out way the @CAPS12 was killing the people over @NUM1 in that town. The last movie that I did not like was ALL the @CAPS13 movies. I just did not like them ok?     I think all of these things are offensive. But I still know that people like them so I would not take them away. There are thing people like but I dont like them. Their things that my friend like but I dont like. Their thing I like and they dont like. But I guess what I am trying to say is in life there are going to be things that you dont like. But you cant get rid of the things you dislike in the world",3,3
4101,"Throughout history there have been many books written at a time in history when their beliefs on certain things differed from what our world today believes. Things that have changed as our world has changed are the views on slavery, womens rights, religion, and many other things. These views are based on what most people of a time frame believed. I feel that just because something someone wrote or said offends someone, does not give people the right to ban that book or quote from society as a whole. They have the right to ban it from themselves, but it is up to each individual whether or not it is banned for everyone.      Our government gives us the right to have freedom of speech. This shows that even though someone @MONTH1 write or speak out against the majority opinion, they can say whatever they want without being punished for it. This means that people can not just ban something for what it might say or portray. In my life explicit music seems to be something that some people are trying to ban. My parents believe that I am at the right age that I should be allowed to listen to whatever type of music I want to.      I feel that public libraries can set age restrictions on items based off language, nudity, and other inappropriate things for children just as movie theaters do, but they do not have the right to ban books. Even though there is an age restriction, as long as the guardian of the child direct says it is fine if his/her child @MONTH1 check out the book or the parent checks out the book for the child, then it is fine that that child gets that book. The choice for what is appropriate for that each child should be left up to their parents.      If libraries had to ban books because someone said that a certain book or magazine was offensive, then a library would have very few to no books. In almost all of books someone @MONTH1 be able to find something offensive to them or to someone else. These books that offend people should be kept on the shelf so that people can understand how society's views on things were back in the time period that the book was written. These items in libraries that are found offensive shows us what was wrong with society at that time and helps us learn from past mistakes in history and how to avoid them. For example, in the play A @ORGANIZATION1 it shows how the society's view of women was. It showed that they did not think highly of women and how there purpose in life were to raise the children and that was it. They did not feel that they had the intellect to talk about science or anything like that. This indirectly teaches us how we should not treat women today.       If libraries start to ban books, music, movies, magazines or other items then they are hiding things they do not want people to read. Libraries should not be able to ban something because it is offensive, but they have the right to put age restrictions on certain things. Authors and artists have freedom of speech to say whatever they want and libraries can not take that away from them",4,4
3872,"Dear @CAPS1,     @CAPS2 is it safe to draw the line on what kids should or should not see as far as the world is concerned. What makes kids behave better, being sheltered from life or being life smart and knowing what is going on in this world.      I think its safe to say what we do or do not want our kids to do, say ect. But in other terms do we have full conrol of our kids @NUM1. I knw that this might sound wierd but I strongly believe in the simple fact hat kids are being over sheltered to day! Our kids are groing up with the new technology. Its the centry for computers and laptops and gaming systems. Our kids dont know what its like to go out side anymore. The world has so much to offer us yet, we turn it down beacuse we see what all the new advances have to offer as well. I think it is very important to be books smart as well as street smart, if you spend all your @CAPS3 doing one thing at at @CAPS3 you are gonna end up lacking on one thing. I blelieve grades will come.     I think that our kids are over sheletered for the simple fact that when our kids see something that we dont want them to see, or there not ready for then there not allowed to see it it, but whos to say on the days your not watching them that there not going to go in the real world and just see exactly what you didnt want them too! This is why its important for you to teachyour child what is going on in the world and noth leave them in the dark.     Also we are living in the new age of life, were computers and laptops are the number one thing in the world right now for people to be usign and on throught the day. It is hard for kids to understand the realness of life since ever thing is done over the internet now. It is a privilage to be so far advanced in the world yet we still dont know what to do!      As we get older we are not gonna know nearly as much stuff as need to be known and taught beacuse as we get older were gettomg, more logic and more information over the materials on the web. Kids will not know how to fix cars or know to start up a lawm mower.      I think that books should not be taken off te shelf beacuse as the day goes by kids reality is getting taken and taken more and more! I think that it is a big deal what kids learn about the everyday life becuse that is our future and if they have no idea what is going on and it scares me beacuse the are going to be alot more battles for our kids to fight we just have to teach them all that we can and hope that they become the best people they can be in life !                                                 Thank You for Your @CAPS3!                                                            Deven",4,4
3426,I think that we should censor things our children read and look at in the libraries.They are young eyes and they are to young to be looking at that stuff.They would be taught the wrong thing at a very young age.They would grow up the wrong way.We need to take a stand on what are kids look at.Fr the future we need censorship.please everyone take a stand,1,1
4049,"I do not believe that such things as book, music, movies, magazines,etc., should be removed from libraries.      First, books can be used as monumental learning sources for kids, teenagers, and adults. Just because a book talks about the @CAPS1 and @CAPS9 dying @MONTH1 be a little inappropriate for some age groups but not for teenagers and adults. Also books give a message about how times use to be. Take a book that refers to slavery and what they use to call black @CAPS9 back then. Just because it has some words that are frowned upon does not mean that kids and @CAPS9 shouldn't know about it and where it came from so they won't go around affending @CAPS9 and they don't even know what the word means.      Next, movies now some movies shouldn't be played for certain age groups and I understand that, but movies like @CAPS2 and To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4 @CAPS5 are teaching us our @ORGANIZATION1 and how far we've come from being segregated and the disrespect of each others race. Also movies gives a more visual way of what things were like so we can kind of get a interactive way on how things look like and how you can relate the book to the movie. Movies also make points, some state if we don't do anything about pollution this is whats going to happen. So movies are definetly a stay on my list.     In addition, a big factor of @CAPS6 and @ORGANIZATION1 is music. I could see how some music could be bad but also some artist talk  about how it really is tough where they come from and how music is a get away for them. Plus, music isn't hurting anybody. We learn how music was in the @DATE1 and compare it to music now. We also learn how music evolves from one thing to another, kind of creating off of itself. Music has the power to say things and communicate with @CAPS9 and make statements that could only be made by music. For example, take somebody giving a speech about what they feel or what they think. Now take that speech put it in a song form and I guarantee that more @CAPS9 capture the message and take it into there grasp on how they could help the cause. Especially if it is by their favorite artist. Say your favorite artist is @CAPS7 @PERSON1, now wouldn't you rather listen to @CAPS7 @PERSON1 make a statement about life or a political view rather than a song like that by @ORGANIZATION2. So music is most definetly staying on the list because it has the power to move @CAPS9, make you feel different ways, and look at things you've never seen in away before.     Last, magazines, some Magazines are just inappropriate.  Now I'm pretty sure that you will not be seing those magazines on shelves of a library so nobody should be worried about that. Now some magazines like @CAPS9 and @CAPS10 @CAPS11 are just there for fun and they are not hurting anybody because its just pictures and honestly no child would read the words of a interview with a famous person. So magazines are harmless to in a library and are only there to stay up on current events and to inform @CAPS9 on if a new discovery was made or whats going on in the @ORGANIZATION1.     In conclusion, I do not believe that things such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from library shelves anywhere.",4,3
3945,"We all find things offensive, wether it be in a book, magazine, movie, cd, tv show, or a newspaper article. Libraries hold all of those items and somepeople @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not want to remove the items that they think are offensive, but would that be right? If everyone went to the library and took everything that they thought was offensive off the shelves, we would have nothing left.      Maybe writers should just cut down on things that are innapropriate, racist, or things that include foul language. Then not as many people would be offended and they would not have any problems with letting their children pick out books on their own. Although, it @MONTH1 not be the writers at fault here. It @MONTH1 be the readers. Some people should just stop taking everything so seriously, then they would not have to worry about things like what their children are reading.     Yes most adult things now are innapropriate for children, but that's why it is for adults. Children have their own selection of books and movies. And parents need to realize that maybe they should take their kids to the childrens section. All types of entertainment are categorized by age and people should start paying more attention to that. If parents started watching what their kids do, then they would not be worrying about the reading or watching something they should not be. That is what parents are for, taking care of their children and some people do not do a very good job of that.     If there is a book you read and it is something you do not want your child to read, it is probably something you read when you were older, so do not worry about it until they get to that age. And maybe then it would be ok of they read it, because they are old enough to realize right from wrong. Parents can not always control what their children do. And if they do by chance pick up the book their parents never wanted them to read, they @MONTH1 see it in a different way than their mother of father did and they @MONTH1 learn a very valuable lesson from it.",3,3
4393,"In this world you never know what someone might writing. There're many materials in this world that I think aren't appropiate for someone to be reading, watching or listenning, ect.  You @MONTH1 be thinking that anyone makes his/her own decision of what they read, watch, listen.  Well, I do agree with that, but I do believe that some materials aren't rate it properly to age.  I do think that some materials should be banned from people under age, some from kids, and some from everyone.      You @MONTH1 be thinking that all of this is wrong and that there is nothing wrong with books, music, movies, ect., but in my opinion some materials are just offensive and not proper. I seen so many materials that I think are not proper for people under age to been looking at. In some movies, for example, the rating is just not right because some movies have so much violence or language.  You might not think it's that big of a deal, of course, but I do. In my opinion, some materials are not too low in rating, and should not be for people under age.     It's not surprising to me that kids are now yelling, hitting, and or acting like a rebels to their parents. Many of this things kids get it from books, music, movies, ect. This is many of the reasons some materials should be banned from kids.  You ask yourself why? Well, first of all, kids are just learnning and they do everything they watch, see, or listen. I mean now kids don't even think about what their about to do.  They just do, they don't care, they think it's okay. I think that parents should be alert to offensive materials in the shelves, and should say something about it so they banned them.     Why banned some materials from everyone?  Well, first of all, why do we even want to watch, see, or listen to things that are not right? You @MONTH1 be thinking that we just do it for fun and that it's enjoyable and nothing wrong with it. Well, you @MONTH1 be right but also wrong.  I certainly do agree with you, we all watched things for fun and to enjoy them, but some things are just too out of this world for us. Why do people do crazy things now in these day? In my opinion, I think is because they mostly get it from books, music, movies, ect.  I think that if a book shows very offensive things they should be banned from everyone no matter what. It's the right thing to do.     If you don't want to see this world get more out of control than it already is. Well, we need to do something about all these materials that are offensive and banned them for good.  We certainly don't want to see our kids yelling, hitting, or and actting like rebels to us. We don't want some crazy person coming to our hosue and do crazy things to us just because that's what they learn from those materials they had on the shelves.  It's come to me that some materials should be banned from people under age, from kids, and some from everyone",3,4
3400,"People @CAPS1 Offensive by Libraries         I think that libraries are sometimes offensive,but not all the time. It  all depends on peoples different beilfs and thier culture. I can see where some things in the library are very offensive and where somethings are not offensive. I believe parents are more offended by things in the library ,because they don't want their kids to experience these things that are not the childs age. Movies that are at the library @MONTH1 be offensive ,because if a parent rents a moive for their child and gets home and puts in the @CAPS2. Then finds out that the moive they wasn't a kids moive ended up being an adults moive.           Parents who don't want their kids to look at inporatiate  things should not be suable for their childs age.One way to sovle this problem is to keep a eye on their child and make sure they don't go anywhere esle except the childrens area. This would sovle so many problems if parents would actually follow through with this it might work. Some parents bring their child up they way they want to. Also the parent or parents teach their kids that they don't need to go in any other area expect the one they are suppose to go in unless their parents tell them otherwise.       I do get offensive sometimes when I go in the library, because they are some people who thinks it's funny to look at things just for fun not for any purpose. They make a big deal about and I don't like when people do that ,because it makes you think of the library as not such a place you wanna be at. If i was a person who got offensive by something that was on the shelf at the library I would pass it up and not pay attention to it. But some people would tell the people who are running the library that this certain thing on their shlef is very offensive to me and bothering me.      If I had an issue with the library for some certian reason I would complain. Because complaining will more than likely do something about it. Instead,of not saying anything it won't get done or change it so it's not offensvie to others. I would let  them know how I felt about a certain product in the library in a soft and calm manner. When you complain about something might as well complain in a nice way, because if you do then that person you are complaining to will be nice back.     I know that everyone is not the same and feel the same about everything. But one thing is for sure is to keep on living life and don't let simple things about a library product offending you or bother you.You could not got to the library anymore if it's a problem or ignore the image that is offending you. There are so many ways to handle a situation like this it's just how you handle it. One way is to be respectful to people and people @MONTH1 be respectful back. Your attitdue has a lot to do with telling someone that something is offending you. If you can't get anywhere that way then just forget it and move on",3,4
3523,"Does it ever come to mind when your child says they're going to the library to study, but in reality they could be going there to find books about murder, violence, or possibly helpful information. @DATE1 when searching through the library you never know what @CAPS3 will find on the shelves. Most of the topics of books, music, movies, or magazines are helpful. But there's always that one @CAPS2 that you don't want your child finding, or that one movie you just hope your child isn't watching! I strongly believe that the the types of topics like violence and murder should be taken off of the library shelves.      When going to the library parents should be able to trust that their child is actually going there to study, not to look up bad books, movies, or magazines. Too many books and movies are showing that relying on violence is a good thing. For example when children are searching for a good book they aren't looking for something boring, they're looking for something that catches their eye. Most of these books resulting to violence. The more kids read about this, the more they think violence is okay.      Also magazines like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' or '@CAPS3 @CAPS2' are now showing stories of drugs use, teen pregnancy, or death of famous @CAPS3. @DATE1 our world has been increasing in the drug use of teens and adults, also the pregnancy rate of teens has went up dramatically in the past few years. These two things are not okay. I personally believe the reason these two topics have went up is because kids are thinking it's fine since they're reading about it in the new magazines, or seeing it on a tv, or reading about it in a book.  Kids or teens are believing it's easy to have a child at such a young age, or using drugs is cool because all the hot famous @CAPS3 are using them, which is shown in the magazines and books. But what kids aren't understanding is that it's really not as easy or fun as the movies, books and magazines are making it sound.     What happened to the library's that had information that was actually helpful in school? I understand that @CAPS3 are wanting to read about famous @CAPS3 and what's new with them. But when all of these types of books, magazines, and movies are put into our libraries it is limiting the amount of actual helpful information kids need for school or adults are needing for work. When I was younger,  I would go to the library and I either went thier to study or to check out a good book. Not a book about violence, murder, or teen precnancy. Kids need to be able to rely on the libraries for a good book or information that will help them in school, not on topics that don't relate to school at all.     As author, Katherine Paterson said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf'. I believe she is correct, these types of books, magazines, and movies that we don't want our kids finding need to be removed from the shelves of our libraries @DATE1",4,4
3424,"Regardless of if we are speaking of the religous demanding books such as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 series to be ripped from our shelves or @CAPS3 wanting to burn the @LOCATION1, books can always bring about controversy. In this country we are given the rights to freedom of speech and press, so why can anyone demand that a book be banned? Everyone in our world has different thoughts, beliefs, morals and values so why should we try to force our own views on others? We should not. Imposing our views upon others can be done just as easily through putting a controversial book on the shelves as it can by taking it off. Music, movies and magazines are no different, all express the ideas and beliefs of their respective writer, and all deserve to be accessed by anyone who desires to do so.     Books, there are lists of hundreds of banned books and honestly you could find a dozen reasons to ban any book ever written. If you ban one writers words because they speak passionately or discretely on a controversial topic, then you must ban them all, and if you have to ban the words then you must also ban the writer so that he or she cannot voice his or her opinion. If we did this then our country and our world would be without opinion, voiceless, and without a voice their is no direction and no moving forward. If the people of our world are denied the right to write a book on their opinion then what kind of world do we live in? If you can ban my words, then I can ban yours and we have both lost our voice and our chance at somehow brightening the future.      Imagine the impact if the @CAPS4 had locked away every copy of the @CAPS5 because it brought about change and controversy. Imagine a world where we had never heard of @CAPS6 or @CAPS7. It would be a would far different from our own. A world without powerful voices influencing not only our daily actions, but hundreds of years of war, love, and hate. It would be one without direction, where people are left to wonder but never to express or discuss. It would be a terrible place.     While children should not exactly be watching porn or reading '@ORGANIZATION1', they definantly should not be kept from reading, listening to, or watching anything they desire. Values and morals should be gained by reading, discovering and thinking, not forced upon us by our government or our parents. Rap music @MONTH1 have lyrics that some would consider rude but to another they @MONTH1 speak a message. To a creationist @PERSON1's views @MONTH1 seem stupid and offensive, but to an atheist they @MONTH1 be what makes sense. We should all have access to all opinions so that we can develop our own.      We should not have the values and ideas of others beaten into our heads, we should be able to develop our own through an exploration through those of others. Censorship is wrong, our government has no business in what we choose to explore and no one should be restricted by the views of another.",4,4
3366,"Should certain materials be removed from our library shelves just because it has uncensored materials inside of it? My opinion is no, actually heck no! Now don't get me wrong, but I'm not the type of person that likes reading materials like that all the time, but every once in a while there is a really good book or magazine I would like to read that is uncensored. The bad thing is that  I am told I cannot just because it says something or shows a picture of something a teenager supposidly shouldn't be seeing.      One of my main questions on this material is why are they allowed to show statues of the early roman times in our history books but not materials we hear and see on a daily bases? Half of the time the statues are of a naked person. I don't see why that is allowed but other materials about our times are not. We are in the time period were people are open that it doesn't bother them to see that stuff. Yes, some materials are not suited for teenagers my age, but honestly I hear offensive things all the time when I walk through the halls in my high school.      Someone @MONTH1 have an opinion about how the material is offensive, but if its so offisive why do they bother even complaining or thinking about it. Yes, everyone has a right to their own opinion, but thats there opinion and that doesn't make them always right. That person can have there opinion but other people have opinions that might oppose the other persons opinion. Does that make them wrong? You will never know because everyone has there own and who knows whose opinion is right.      Another statement I would like to just throw out there is that we teenagers are learning to make our own decisions because in the near future we are going to be adults and have to make those choices on our own. So, just let us choose if we would like to read material with uncensored things in it. It is our choice, why can't we just choose it without people telling us we cannot.      I still do not see why it is such a big deal of reading uncensored material. Why can't they just allow the materials in our libraries. Don't make any decisions for us because we can do it ourselves, we are learning how to be more adult like, right?",4,4
4564,"Everyone has there own opinions and arguements about something. There are a lot of books that can be offensive to people in some ways. There can be over thousands of books in a library, and I find it difficult sometimes to find that right book that interests me. My personal opinion is that i do not think that books should be removed from a shelf even though it @MONTH1 offend someone.     As I stated in the first paragraph, everyone has there own opinions. There are so many types of books out there from murderes, romance, mysteries, drugs, and many more. These books should be placed in seperate areas just as many books are. If books are taken off a shelf what does that mean to us people? Everyone has there own freedom. So if books are going to be moved from someone that's taking away from are individual freedom.      There are more to books in a libray also. From books, movies, music, magazine, etc., can all of the have different types to them. I do think they should just be placed in different areas. I can see where people think that this can cause an influence to young children if they pick up something that is disturbing, but they should be with an adult. Adults know what is right from wrong than what children do. For example, whenever i walk into public places i hardly every see children just running around especially in libraries. Libraries are expected to be kept quiet and not out jumping around and screaming. The kids should be kept with there parent or an adult that way they can't grab something they shouldn't.     I understand that some teenagers can be offended to drugs or killings, in magazines or books, but some people like reading about that kind of stuff. Does that mean we have the right to take it off the shelf because one is offended? To many think they have the right to do anything without negociating with others. People that do not like that kind of stuff should just put it back down and go on with what they were doing.I can understand if you think that restrictions should be put on some things because i will agree. There should be sections for teens, adults, and children. To me that does not mean we have to remove anything though from otheres for offending someone.                 Libraries can have an affect on your everyday life because of how calming and soothing it can be. You should be able to have freedom without removing anything from anyone. Taking away things does not mean your just taking away from one, it means your taking away from everyone. You can have your own censorship in libraries from your individual freedom. These are my personal views on why things should not be removed from shelves or anything else",3,3
3948,"Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them. Others do not. For me I dont.     I do not believe that certain materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves because there are different types for different types of people. If a person took offense from a book or magazine I believe that person should just put it back. If books that offended people couldn't be on the shelves there would be no books on the shelves because I'm sure there's atleast one person in the world that would take offense to each book. There are o lot of people in the world after all.      For music there's different types also. There's rap, country, rock, pop and many more. For example if someone likes rap but not country that person has a choice to listen to rap and not country. If that person doesn't like country though it shouldn't be removed because others @MONTH1 like country and want to listen to it.     For movies there are many different types. There's horror, comedy, romance and many more. That's why at the theater there's different rooms for different movies. People always have a choice.     Many people like different books, music, movies, and magazines. Some people take offense to them although some don't. Every person is different. People like different things. That is, in my opinion, the beauty of human nature",3,3
3281,"At a local library you can find hundreds of books, all of different matter, a different style and of different stories. Not every person enjoys the same type of topic to read about, not every person enjoys the same music style, nor does every person enjoy the same fashion in a magazine or the same articles written in the magazine. No one is the same, we all have different likes and interest.      Some people @MONTH1 find certain books distrubing and inapporiate, that the book shouldnt be allowed to be on the shelves of libraries. That is only some people, what one person finds distrubing and gross another person can find interesting. Not one person is the same so not all books are going to be eye ctaching and interesting to every person. If one person finds a book to be inapporaite, yet another finds it interesting and suggest that book to their friends, is that one whom disagress upon the reading material as unexceptable to thier community allowed to take the book from the shelf, not allowing anyone else to read it. Everyone should be given the same oppertunity to read the book that another made find inapporaite.     People should be allowed to read the material and topics they enjoy to read. But when it comes to a nude magazine, all about sex and being naked, that should be in adult stores only. A child in the library can wonder over to the adult side and pick up the magazine and see all those women, that mother doesnt want her child to be able to pick up and porn magazine or video when she takes the child to the library. You must be eighteen or older to view or buy those magazines, so only keep those magazine in adult stores where childern wont be able to view them. Now some books @MONTH1 have a naked picture in the text but it could be to show how to give a breast examination, to educate women about breast cancer and to help prevent seriousness over that matter, to well educate the people in our society about the matter. Books of diseases that @MONTH1 have nude photos should be allowed, they educate the communitry and save lives. Although not one persons voice or opinion should be heard over others, we were all created equal, we all should be heard. Books are as of the same way, they were all created equal for men, women, boys, and girls to be allowed to read and find adventure, excitment, sorrow and anger. We all have different hungrys for different reading, music and fashin.     In this world today, in our society, and in our community there are different views upon what the children should be reading or should be allowed to pick off the shelf at their local library. Books were created by different people, who dont share the same views,who look upon life in a different way, whose voices arent all the same. The book has a curse word in the text, that doesnt mean the book is an abomination and will poison the community. That book could be one of the best books the child or adult has every read in their life.       Everyone has different views, likes, interest, wants and needs. Not one person shares the same hunger of reading material. We should all be given the oppertunity to read or not read what another person finds inapporaite. The author as well deserves to be heard and not shunned out because some people view his or her material unexecptable for the shelves of their local library. Freedom of speech, freedom of happiness should be implyed with the pursuite to find a book that feeds the hunger of one person. Let every voice be heard, let every word be read, no matter how big, small, or how many imapporaite context is included.Let everyone read as they please and let everyone be marry in what they read",4,4
3658,"Have you ever been at the library and asked yourselve any of the following questions? Who reads this? Why is it here? Are kids reading or watching this stuff? Do kids check these out? Or have you ever wondered or said to your self any of these statements? I don't want my kids to pick this up and read this. This is so offensive. This goes against all our morals. I don't know what kind of freak convention this is but I'm no part of it. Lets get out of here. This place is wack. Ever consider what books get banned from the library? Who bans the books?          I think things should have to be very offensive to pull them off the shelves. I think that they should just stick them to a side of the library and put a age on it or you have to be a certain age to check out those books. I dont think the cussing books are that offensive. When the person (No matter who it is)goes out into the world. They are going to learn and hear curse words. People use them like they do the words 'and' or 'the'. They are going to hear them till thier grave. Wheather they chose to use them or not that's thier choice.        For them to be banned or moved to a diffrent group of books they should have to be sexist, raciest, have alot of sex, or just really grusome. I think they should go upstairs with the mushy romance and wacked out western. I mean people could go up there and check them out but that is the adult library area. The staircase should be by the circulation desk. When they are not busy they should go upstairs and check and see if there are any young children up there.      I think The top level or a certain area should be the adult area. They have mushy lovey dovey stuff, they have cow boy shoot off stuff, and the offensive stuff. The stuff with too much sex, really raciest, or really sexist, or grusome stuff like people killing people for fun.Also they should have the adult magazines up there too. Don't act like you don't know what im talking about. You know how you go down a aisl at the @CAPS1 market and there are girls in thier bikini and half naked. Then there are the cosomos both should be upstairs. I mean they talk about how to give pleasureable sex. I would hate for some little @NUM1 year old or @NUM2 year old to pick that thing up she would be scarred for life.      Then the main level or area should be teen books. You know vampire books, @CAPS1 heros, crazy fiction stuff, and then the magazines and movies that aren't bad. Then the bottom level should be the children level. Games puppets and movies and easy books. That about sums that up.      I dont think just anybody should be able too ban a book. I think it should be open but not just anyone. There should be a huge meeting. With the mayor, a couple teachers one english teacher from each level, and parents, and the librabiens. The person who wants in banned should have to tell everyone why and stuff. Like Author Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have the exact same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left for any of us.",5,5
4343,No they should not have the cd's books and  etc off the store shleves. they should leave them on the shelve si think.  they should olny remove the old video games. and books and music. every other,1,1
4097,"@PERSON1 is saying we shall all share then never giving @CAPS4 back. Also we can't all get what we want at the sametime or at all. If that book is popular then they should of bought more to sell for the other people that doesn't have the book and would like to have @CAPS4.      Of course sharing is better then wasting your money on something when someone has the book that you know and would let you barrow @CAPS4. And yes, We all know that most people these days don't usually share.      To tell you the truth you don't always get what you want. Either get over @CAPS4.      Yea @PERSON2 has a @CAPS1 but to tell you the truth everybody has there own opinion.     We all don't have to listen to what other's say but if you agree with that person then you agree.      Like I said everybody has there own opinion and I stated mine.Pretty much like '@CAPS1 OF @CAPS2.'      No, I do not believe that books,music, and etc. should be taken off the shelves because @CAPS3 @CAPS4's stupid you'll lose your job and @CAPS5 people out there in the world need something to do @CAPS6!?     I don't read I mostly listen to music because I think music to me is more interesting and entertaning then reading a book. I mean yea I read articles from magazines but like I said mostly listen to music.     Reading a book is mostly like someone telling you a story about so and so or somthing . So to me @CAPS7 book is in infront of @CAPS7 face @NUM1. '@CAPS7 life'     @CAPS8 later on in @CAPS7 life I will be interested in reading a book but now I'm enjoying @CAPS7 life being a teenager.     So basically I'm telling you @CAPS7 own opinion and I think @CAPS4's completely stupid for being graded for this because everybody has there own opinion just saying.     You could either agree or disagree but for this @CAPS4's mostly a disagree",2,2
4137,"In the @LOCATION1 @DATE1, there consists of many libraries that are available to the public with an interminable amount of information. All of this information gives us many opportunities in life to discover new courses and paths to take. Byt what if some of this information has a bad influence in our world? What if some of this information changed the persective of peoples' lives, and who people are? Libraries do contain offensive and provokative books, movies, and other things that can possibly be hurtful to the behavior standpoint of all human beings. Censorship in libraries should be established and set because the people in the @LOCATION1 come from many different places making the @LOCATION1 very diverse. One thing in a book @MONTH1 not be offensive to one individual although it could be for someone else. Magazines, movies, books, etc. should be examined and determined whether it is appropriate for people at certain @CAPS1 whether by building a child section for books and movies and such, or having knowledgable assistance to help what people are looking for.     Sections in libraries organizes the library providing and easier access to where things are located. In libraries, there are search engines to help people find information in a particular location. The benefit of having sections divided depending on people's @CAPS1 is that it seperates the mature section from the immature section appose to having both in one. Children normally have a seperate section for children books while older and more mature adults or teenagers have a section to gather their important information from. An example of a bad situation would be if their was a book located in the childrens section that spoke about drugs and alcohol. The children that scrutinized that book would be confused because they do not understand what drugs and alcohol are. They could learn bad things about it and children tend to think they are invisible drawing them to try anything or everything that could possibly be life-taking. This is common sense. Sections in libraries do help establish a sense of organization, although personal assistance would be helpful as well.     Personal assistance and help on finding information in libraries is very helpful although they must be mature, understand, and know that their are books in libraries that could be about offensive material. Asssistance can help us determine if the person that is looking for information about something and there is inappropriate stuff inside the book, the assistant can let the person know about it. Because there is an interminable amount of information, I believe that there will be books left on the shelf for many people to learn about. Everytime I visit a library, there are always books on the shelves, and when I ask for assistance, they help me find what I am looking for. They warn me about offensive or provokative imagery and such and help me with upmost respect. Assistance can help prevent any sort of confusion with books, movies, etc. Assistants are ready to help people find what they are looking for and warn the people and are knowledgable about the offensive things that are in each book, movie, etc.      Personally, I believe that freedom of speech comes into play in libraries. Writers and authors write about information that is fact or also opinion, and typically people learn about subjects that people enjoy or want to discover. Censorship in libraries is necessary to let people know about it, although assistance do not have the right to not let anyone read a particular book because it is inappropriate or provokative. Everyone in the @LOCATION1 has the right to read whatevery they please. Some measures must take place for example towards minors because otherwise it could lead to issues or disasters, but there should not be a law that prohibits a child from reading something. There is no such thing as a book that should be thrown out because every word that comes out out of peoples' mouthes are useful no matter how rediculous it is. Even if it is the most rediculous thing you ever heard, that particular person that said something made you think about it and that thought process helped you make a decision in your life that was next to come. This would be more on opinion based writing. In factual righting, it is something that remains in peoples' heads and is saved into the brain like a word document. This document that is saved can be changed and saved again even if the knowledge is offensive. Offensive factual information is hurtful to some although it is fact meaning it happened or is true.This brings me to my persepective on the matter that I think there should be a sense of censorship within reason although everyone has the right to read whatever they please because there is a never ending amount of information in the world and that information, including opinion, would make the shelves be empty from books",4,4
3398,"Do you feel that some material should just not be allowed in libraries? Censorship in libraries are a touchy subject. Many people with young children believe that some books should just not be allowed in the libraries, while others believe that because it is a book, no matter what, it should be allowed to be in the library. Who knows, someone @MONTH1 need to write a paper over that certain 'touchy' book. I think, personally, that as long as the book is in a proper section, it sould be okay for a person, of the right age, to be able to get that book or other material.     The libraries should have a certain area for children's books and another area for adult or teenage level reading or material. This way, there is a less likely hood that a young child will end up getting a book with material for an adult or teenager. The library in the town that I live in has a clearly marked area for children and teenagers. This way, young children are not going to be looking for their favorite book with a book over something many adults should not even be reading.     If people are concerned about someone being to young to read or view the material, the library can also put an age restriciton on the material. This way anyone who is under the age limit will not be able to get the material. The people who are of proper age will be able to get the material, however.      Libraries are very important sources for studing in many people's lives. If people did not have a library, they @MONTH1 not be able to research a paper, or something else, that they need to get finished. I feel if people do not like the material that they see in their local library, then they should just not look at it or borrow the material from the library. I do feel, however, that little children should not be given even the slightest chance to stuble upon a book with disturbing material. There, in my opinion, needs to be a room with said materials that children have, in no way, access to. This way, children are not able to access the material, but they are still able to go into the library without their parents feeling that the children @MONTH1 see something unsuitable for them.     I feel that those people who love reading should be able to go into a library, and not be afraid of if they are going to see a book containing material they believe to be unsuitable. I also feel that if I need to research something that is deemed, by others, to be offensive, I should somehow be able to research my subject. Also, if I was the author of a book that was said to be 'bad,' i would not want my book to be taken away, so that no one could read it, or study and learn from it.      I do not think that censorship is something that people should take lightly. We all have the freedom of speech, so why not let the authors of the materials have that same freedom. There are procautions that parents and people who do not want to see this literature can take. Total censorship, I feel, would not allow for people to broaden their minds. If people just take procautions, there is no need for total censorship of materials, that someone worked very hard on for everyone to see",4,4
4190,"@CAPS1 us? @CAPS1 now? Those questions just might be flashing through your head right now.  The reason @CAPS1 I am writing to you today is to give you my point of view on the censorship in the worlds libraries today.  In this context hopefully I will be able to enlighten you on the subject, also with the questions of '@CAPS1 us?', and '@CAPS1 now?'.     Censorship, what does that mean to you?  To me that means censoring many things in the world to protect it from children who are under the age, not people who are old enough to handle inapropiate things.  In todays libraries there are many uncensored things, that happen to be in the adult section of the libraries.  Things such as books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the adult section, also labeled as the uncensored section, if that is where they rightfully belong.  Now you are probably wondering, @CAPS1 us.     In today's world many people want to protect their children from harmful things, such as uncensored materials. @CAPS1 us?  In the world today there are so many laws, regulations, and even authorities protecting our rights. Now many people want to try to get around the government protecting our rights.  Many want to protect their youth from some of the so called 'harmful' things in society.  Today you can try to create a law or bill that @MONTH1 make it through the government, now some of them are trying to remove the uncensored material.         @CAPS1 now?  Throught the years the world has changed, everything has become easier to have access to.  Now one thing they think they @MONTH1 be able to do is remove the adult section of the libraries if enough people stand to fight for it, it will not happen.  There is an adult section for adults not children, people need to realize that.       In the end, the adult section needs to stay in our libraries. Some of the material in the section is not always bad, sometimes it contains material over war, and recessions.  When people are of age they are allowed to enter the areas, not any younger.  Don't punish the rest of the world for one libraries mistake of letting children have access to adult material, make the children realize it wasn't their area to be in.  Then many parents @MONTH1 see it's not just some of the world, that the whole world is exactly the same way. The books, music, magazines, and etc., need to stay where they are",4,4
4763,"I blieve that any book or movie that is in the the library is in the library for a good reason. The world is full with things that will hurt and make a perosn feel bad about their self, and there is things in the world that will make you feel like you on top of the world.     Yes, there is things that children can see and what they are not suppost to see, and those things are mostly likely  not expost to the student until they are at a muture and a responiable age.      Life is full of things and as children grown up they are going to be teach, show things that parent thinks that is uncomfortable.       Such as: Books that show people with disoders, a books about romance, movies with cussing and sex scenes in the movies, violence, some parnet don'@CAPS1 even want their children to see a simple kiss on the cheek. Which I find really weird because things like that are going to happen in life.      On the other hand, if your child is doing things that they shouldn'@CAPS1 be doing then okay. Take acting. I also agree that a children @NUM1 shouldn'@CAPS1 be thought sex and show either what female have and what boys have on their body. Their mind shouldn'@CAPS1 even be set on that. Books, movies, @CAPS1.v shows shouldn'@CAPS1 be remove because they show what life is about and what is going to happen when you get older.",3,3
4166,"People will always take things offensive.  It is a fact of life.  No one will ever be completly satisified no matter what.  We can not try to please everyone, but it will never happen.  We have a freedom of speech even if those words are offensive to others.  Things on the internet are offensive and no one can mandate how it is veiwed either.  The same should go for a library.     I understand a parent's concern with their child reading or listening to things that are not appropriate.  Some of the things authors write can be either innapproraite or offensive.  That is their freedom of speech.  We can not take that away from them but there should be some censorship at least to the apprearance of books.  For music and movies they usually have a warning lable if it is not intended for younger kids.  It might be a good idea for some libraries to do the same with books and magazines.      In order to see a rated, '@CAPS1', movie you have to be over @NUM1 and for a good reason because of the mature content.  The books being writen now are more and more mature.  But if we take on the custom of being of certain age for books we might invaid the privacy of others.     No one has the right to remove books from a library's shelf on the count of being offensive.  Who can judge whether something is offensive? The libraries are publicly owened and therefore have no one owner.  The city owns them.  If there is a problem with whether a book should be at the library it is the city's decision.  Even if there is such an uproar about one book, unless the decision is unnanimous, no book should be taken off the shelves.  The book should simply be put in a spot either behind the counter or where it is available only on request.      Taking books off the shelves I beleive is taking away from the public's ability to read.  If a parent is concerned about what their child might read, they should confront their local librarian.  The librarian @MONTH1 be able to help them retrieve books that are appropriate and apealing to their child.",3,4
3734,"It dose not really mater to me, we all have the wright to are one likes and dislikes. Someone @MONTH1 not think that movies with blood in thim should alowed, but other @MONTH1 thimk that movie with adalt content should not not be alowed. If you dont like something and someone eles dose why should you get what you want and not what someone eles want. So if we tacke one movie, book, magazine, type of song or music off the market why dont we just all of thim off the market. Then there will be no arument about what is soutibal to watch and what is not. So if you dont like somthing or have littal kids and dont want thim to watch something or read somthing or look at somthing then just bont bay thim and if you do make sore it were they cant reach or fine or get to",2,2
4092,"A @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 there ever a time where there @CAPS3 a movie that you wanted to see, but due to graphics in the movie you were not aloud to see it? Many parents or young adults believe that movies being @CAPS1 are a good thing. What they do not know is that if something is @CAPS1 that's just going to make the kid want to go see it more.     Frist of all, if they kids want to see it badly enough they will just sneek in or get a copy of it off the internet, which is illegal. I remember when I @CAPS3 younger me and my friends always wanted to go see @CAPS4 rated movies. So we would have our parents drop us off. When we would arrive home are parents would ask what we saw, we would lie and say we saw the new @CAPS5 @CAPS6 movie. Therefore kids will get into trouble for a stupid thing.         Secondly if you don't believe your child should watch a movie because of your religous beliefs, then you and your child should have a talk. Statistics show that the more the kids can talk to their parents openly and come to an agreement, the less the child is going to lie and go behide their parents back. Many parents come to an agreement, that if they get to preview the movie frist then they will decide if it is approprite for their child to watch. In many cases this works out great for the parents and children, fore if the adult gives premission for the child to go see it then the parent and child will have something to talk about when they get home.    Finally, I believe movies should be uncensored. For the movies are not really that bad, your child will end up seeing it one way or another. Whether it's at a friends house the internet, or going to the theater. What harm could it cause to see it now.      So in conclusion to my statements.To know that your child will see this movie, wouldn't it be okay not to censore it. 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. and then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' as said by Katherine Paterson is true. Could you imagine living in a @CAPS1 wold? I know I can't. So think are you for or against censorship. Would you want your kid to lie to you about where they were going or what they saw? I know I wouldn't",4,4
3527,"There are plenty of books that people don't want their children reading. Books such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @PERSON1' is a book I had read and it was very out there and straight forward. But I would have to disagree I think those books deserve to be read. It shows kids that not everything is perfect.      People complain about how they think books are bad or things people say on @CAPS3 or in music is bad but if you don't want to listen to them, don't let your kids listen to it. If parents are so worried about what kids are reading or learning because of the world we live in now, lock them up. But I do have to agree with one thing, there are alot of bad things in muic and magazines but I think it can be avoided and not be caused to crupt a kid. I'm very into music and some music I dont listen to because of the things in it but I dont let that music or magazines change my option on things. I dont think people should be able to take books of the shelfs becaue it doesnt give other students or people to read them. Some people get inspired by books about drugs, not like to use them but to know that there are people out there that have overcome stitutions just like them. I like reading books about teenage problems and like to know all the different ways people have overcome them and see how they live. If people can get offended off of a book or movie I don't think they have a right to take that away. I think people that feel offended by books, magazines, and movies should stay away from them if they are offensive to them, because everyone has an option and not everyone thinks the same things.      With all the bad or good movies or books out there, I'm certain someone at least feels offended by one or two books or movies but that isn't a reason to want to take it down. Because once you do that someone will take a book you thought wasn't offensive and it will make you mad. I think if people stayed away from things that offended them and stayed close to books that they liked we wouldn't have much of a conflict unless you get that picky, always wanting to start a fight person to find something else to be picky about with the books or magazines or movies",4,4
4687,"Have you ever read something that you have found offensive, upsetting, or has made you mad? Do you think that there are certian books that shouldn't be allowed in a library because of its content? A lot of books, music, movies, and magazines these days contain things that are hurtful to society or protray bad images of certian social groups.      In @DATE1's society there are many different groups of people and a lot of them have thier own opinions on how they view different things. To me, when I think about a library, I think about how all different ages of people go to them, how there are many different groups of people there, and about the types of books that are in there. Taking this all into concideration, I believe that everything should be allowed in public libraries but I do think that there should be seperate places for books, magazines, and movies that should be only for adults. I think this because if you take away all the things that are 'bad' or 'offensive' to you, you could be displeasing those who find these things interesting or enjoy reading them. In this case, people would not come to the library anymore because they cannot read what they enjoy reading or find interesting.      By saying these things, seperating the books into age groups is a good thing because then the younger children who are running around the library will not pick up something that they should not be looking at. I also believe that is would benefit them because then if someone comes into the library looking for a book but does not really know what to do and they go to where their age group would be; then they can see everything that is recommended for them.      From my own experience, I know that I have read some books and looked at some magazines that I probably should not have looked at because I was too young. This does not mean that they need to take them off the shelves but maybe that they should be placed in an area where someone my age will not be able to find them. So the next time you go to the library and see something that is offensive to you, just remember that there are a lot of different people in this world who might find what you think is offensive, interesting",4,4
3575,"Censorhship should play a major part in which books should enter and leave the library. Thats why I think that if a book, movie, magazine, or cd should deffinitly should be removed from the shelf if it is found offensive to atleast ten children. Now it would be asking too much to have the libraian read through all the books to make sure there is no bad language or anything else that a parent might not want their child to read about. So therefore a library should have a certain section that if a libraian thinks that there might be some bad language or refrence to drugs or alcohol then that book should go into that part of the library. I have found some books that have some pretty graphic material in them that I dont think a little kid should be reading but there was nothing I could do about it except take it up to the libraian.      Movies would be a major thing that they would have to watch out for. Just because the movie has a title that dont seem that bad dont mean that there wont be any grapic images in that movie, or that there wont be any inappropriate language used at one point in the movie. Now since movies are alot easier to review and since they also have a rating then that should make it easier to tell if that movie should go on the shelves of a library or not. But there should deffinitly be a part in the library that if they did want to allow certain movies in there that would be inappropriate for little children then those movies should be put in that part of the library that has a door on it so the kids would know not to go in that room.      Music would be another thing you would deffinitly have to watch out for because with each song could change how the languge is in that cd. So I think that the librarian should have to sit down and persoanlly listen to that cd before they decide to put it out on the shelves for others to be able to listen to. But personally i think that there should be no music allowed in libraries just because with every new cd album that an artist makes he could easily change how his wording is in the songs. So you just never know what the artist of the song is going to do with his music. One album can be perfectly fine and not have one cuss word on it, but then the next album that he or she makes could just be loaded with cuss words.      Another possible way to prevent little kids from hearing or reading about inappropriate stuff is to have some of the books, magazines, cd's, or movies catagorized by age. As a child gets older he will be tought more about certain things. Then once he picks up that book and sees that its mentioned in the book it wont be that big of a shock to him or his parents. With the way things are today its almost impossible for a kid to pick something up and not read about drugs or violence. So if you were to go through and take everything off the shelf that mentioned drugs or violence then there would be nothing left on the shelfs for kids to listen to or read.      Your not going to be able to catch every single movie, book, magazine, or cd that has something to do with violence or alcohol use. But you can take some of the stuff that has alot of that kind of stuff in it off the shelf. By just taking some of the materials off the shelf that contain stuff that @MONTH1 seem inappropriate for children will deffinitly make a big difference and it could possibly protect your child from reading across it someday when he or she reads a book and sees that or listens to a cd and hears the artist metion something about that.      Game designers are now starting to make all their games around violene. So if you were to take all the games that have violence in them and take them off the shelf there would be no games left for kids to play. So there are just some things that contain violence that you just cant keep your child from seeing at one point in time. All the games have a rating on them so you should have an adult check that game rating before you let your child get that game. By doing that you will be able to somewhat controll what your child will see and it will also make it better because then you are not taking games that other kids might like off the shelf and making them no longer available.      So I have pretty much covered about how who ever is in charge of the games, books, movies and cds should look them over and possibly listen or look at them just to see what they are like before they put them out on the shelf. You dont have to censor everything but there are deffinitly some things out there that should not be put out on the shelfs for little kids to look at or listen to. And if a little kid wants to get a game a parent should have to look at the game and the rating of the game to determine if that child is mature enough to handle what goes on in that game. But overall I personally dont think that they should just go through and ban everything from going on the shelfs it should be up to the child to determine if they can handle what that movie or book contains",3,3
3568,"I do not believe that censorship should be an option for people that find a book, magazine, or movie offensive. I believe that if a person decides to take a book off the shelf because he/she is offended, they are obviously paranoid. If a few cuss words are found in a book and a person doesn't want their children to read that book, then don't allow them to get it. Don't make all of the other people suffer. Censorship is an unnecessary solution to something that isn't even a problem. You know what they say, 'If it ain't broken, don't fix it.'      @CAPS1 of all, people have a variety of opinions. Some people think that violence is ok and some people don't think it's ok. If one person decides to put a book off the shelf because they find it offensive, what will the next person think? They @MONTH1 find violence perfectly acceptable and they might allow their kids to read the book. Then it would create a big conflict.     Lastly, parents need to allow their kids to grow up and mature. They also need their kids to know the difference between right and wrong. If they don't read books or movies with violence or cuss words when they're young, what will they do when they discover it when they're older? As a child, it is a time to learn life lessons and begin to form clear distinctions between right and wrong. Shielding your children from it will only hinder their progress in figuring things out and learning to think for themselves as adults.     Censorship is the same thing that @PERSON1 did to prevent people to think for themselves and discover that his tactics were a great evil to society. In other words, censorship is part of fascism and should not even be considered in @CAPS2 society. The citizens of @LOCATION1 have the responsibility of exposing the truth and teaching our children the differences between right and wrong. It's one of the ideals that help make this country great",5,5
4599,"Should materials, such as books, music, movies, or magazines be removed from the shelves if they are offensive? I don't think so, because it might not be offensive to every body, it would be brakeing the law, and it's not fair to the artist that created them.     Just because it's offensive to one person donsn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, some people might think the @CAPS1 is offensive, while to others, it's there religion. It would just go to show that one mans garbage, is another mans tresher.     It would also be braking the law, because it would not be giving the artist their freedom of speech. It would silense all the great artist out there, trying to be herd. They should be able to write, sing, or film what ever they want. It is their right to do so.     That is the resion why they souldn't be removed from the shelves. It wouldn't be fair to the artist that created them, it would be braking the law, and what one person thinks isn't what every one thinks",3,3
3282,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3:     @CAPS4 I am @PERSON1 and I have heard there has been a discussion about different things in libraries.  And I would like to let you know what I think about the whole situation.  There are many things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that people believe aren't appropriate.  Many people have differnt opinions then other people. Everyone had a differnt point of view and sees things differently.  Ecspecially when it comes to what is appropriate for kids.     I believe if a child comes home with a book, movies, etc. and their parent does not approve the parent should go and tell the librarian about why she thinks it isn't appropriate.  The librarian should listen to the parent and then take a look at it for herself and see what she thinks about it.  And if she finds it not approprite then she has the right to take it off the shelf.     If the parent comes in and talks to the librarian about why something is not apropriate and the librarian believes it is alright then maybe she needs to just put the book, movie, etc. in a different area of the library.  Like if a little kid finds a book and the parent says its inappropriate the librarian could take that book out of the little kid section, and maybe put it in a older kid area.       I have actaully had an experience with this.  At my old school adults were always complaining about books they didn't think were appropriate.  When the librarian told us, we were upset because us girls loved to read those books.  The librarian at the time thought they were appropriate and really didn't want to take them out of the library.  So she had a great idea.  She took those books, the ones people were complaining about, and put them on their own special shelf behind her desk.  If you wanted one of those books you had to talk to your parent or bring a note in saying that you were allowed to read the book.  It was a really good idea, because if your parent wouldn't allow you to read them you weren't tempted to get one, and wouldnt even see them.  And the people who were allowed and wanted to read them still could with no problem at all.     Another idea I have is if you see a younger kid by older people books, movies, etc. go talk to them about why they are over there and, tell them that, that's not their age level material.  Try to direct them over to their age level area, and try to find them a book, movie, etc they @MONTH1 be interested in.     I believe that everyone has different opinions but just because one person complains it doesn't mean it has to ruin it for everyone.  Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean everyone else does too.  I think censorship should somewhat be in libraries, but not to the extreme.  There should be many different topics in libraries so everyone enjoyes the stuff there.  There should be action,adventure, humor, love, etc.  Talk to people and see what they like.  And just because one person complains, dont take it out right away because to another person they might love it.  Thank you for taking your time to read my opinion, and I hope I helped",4,4
3760,"There are so many resaons why taking a book, movie, or anything else off the shelves is wrong. If it is violent or sexual i can see why it shouldn't be on the shelves but if the reader doesn't like the book or movie, then don't read it or watch it find something else.     If everyone took a book of the shelf that they didn't like then what would we have to read because everyone has a book or two that they don't like or think is offensive. Every book can't be perfect for that person. Everyone has there own veiws on books wether they like it or dislike it. If that book isn't what your looking for then put it back and stop reading it.     There have been many of people say 'If you don't like it then don't listen to it'. They are excaclly right because if there is something that you can't stand to listen to or read and you do it anyway thats going to make you mad. Then your going to complain that it is on the shelfs and say it is bad and it shouldn't be on the shelves anymore. That is what starts all these things of people saying it is offensive. People know what they like and don't like, so if there is something that you don't like then don't listen to it or read it.      It all comes down to common sence. We all have it we just need to start using it. That means if you like country music then don't listen to hard rock or rap because that isn't what you like so don't listen to it. Because if you listen to it then your like why is that stuff on the shevles for people to listen to it's bad for you it is puting bad thought into those teenager's heads. If eveyone sticks to doing what they like and don't worry about the other stuff then eveyone will be fine.",4,4
4638,"In the book fahernheit @NUM1 all books get burned no matter what they contain and the people are always sad and depressed about everything. Books are an improtnat part of our lives. Some materials do need to be cencored because it might offend some people that are all ready have a hard time with being who they are without these things to add to the flame. Their are some books that are being censored for little to no reason. There might be a rude or a miss understood word that caused books to be unnessisary cencored. Cencorship is important to libraries when used correctly.     We need books for many things from learning to simply use up time. Music has been with mankind since the beginning. Movies show us the ups and downs of life. Magazines inform us on what new and interesting. These things have become imprtant to us as clothes and food. Simply taking these out will make the world will make it a darker palce to live.      Some of these things will cause people to be offended without trying to be. Katherine Paterson says that if I had the right to get rid of a book that offended me then everyone can too and soon all of the bookes will be gone .. We can try to be nice to every one, but somepoint something will insult someone no matter what we do or say. Do we need to get rid of everything for that reason?",2,2
4740,"What @CAPS1 You Do?     A very big battle for a lot of people is if libraries should allow offensive matterial to be on their shelves. Some people don't care, but some people think it's a very big issue. For the people who care, their view on the issue is that the offensive matterial should be taken off of the library shelf. I personally believe that it should be ok for 'offensive' matterial to be on the shelves of the libraties across the @ORGANIZATION1.     What is conciterd offensive? Each and every person has their own view on what they think is offensive. An example is a young child @MONTH1 think that the word 'stupid' is a curse word while some older people think that it is not a curse word. If we did take off all the offensive matterial from the libraries, there @CAPS1 be nothing left. You @MONTH1 think that the @ORGANIZATION2 is a very good book, but if you talk to someone who believes the @ORGANIZATION2 is false, they @MONTH1 think that by having the @ORGANIZATION2 of the shelf is offensive to their own beliefs. Because so many people have a difforent view on what is offensive, no one @CAPS1 ever be able to actually have a non-offensive library. A group of people @CAPS1 not be able to agree on what is or what isn't offensive.      There are a lot of websites and organizations that say what they personally think is offensive and what is not. People can go to those websites and organizations to know what they personally should check out from the library. It should not be the libraries own job to say what you can and can not check out. Each person is responsible for their own actions. If a person wants to check out a book or movie that some people think is offensive, so be it. It is a free world. Some people @MONTH1 not aprove of their choice, but again, they have the right to read that book or listen to that music.     In conclusion I state: no one should be able to say what you can and can not have on the shelves of the library. If someone personally thinks that a movie or book is offensive, then they should not watch that movie or read that book. Really the question should not be, 'Should we remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from the library that are offensive?', the question should be, 'Should I be reading this book, watching this movie, or listening to this music?'. It is everyone's own choice to read a book or listen to a @LOCATION1. We are not accountable for what other people do. It is not the libraries own resonsiblility to be a mother to all of it's cusomers. Let the libraries be!",4,4
3729,"Dear Newspaper;     In libraries I do not feel it is neccasry to take stuff away that poeple could find offensive, because honestly if it offends you than don't look at it. You are your own person and can make your own decisions, if this so called offensive material is not veiwed offensive by someone. Then why should that person be  punished by someone who has to make a big deal out of something. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean I don't like it.          If someone finds a book offensive then don't read it, if there is a magazine that you find offensive, don't read it. It is as simple as that, people are wise enough to know what is good and what is bad for them. There is no reason why someone can't choose what they want to get, where they want it. From observations of my own I have seen numerous times when someone has found someones music offensive, but they don't say anything. They just ignore it, the world needs more people like that. More people who will stand up for what they believe in and won't judge others for what they belief in.     It seems as if the world is becoming filled with a bunch of people who care way to much about what other people are doing. That is not a bad thing nessaccarily but everyone will be offended by something but it is your choice to whether or not let it bug you for the rest of your life. Listen to what ever music, read what ever books or magazines that you want. If someone finds them offensive, so be it. You are your own person and that won't ever change. Do what makes you happy and nothing else.",3,2
4586,"Should we censor the materials in libraries?  Some people believe that some of the books, magazines, and music in libraries are too vulgar and obscene.  This could be a major problem if people are allowed to say what is too obscene to be put in a library.  Katherine Paterson makes a great point by saying that if everyone was allowed to take books, magazines, and music that they find inappropriate off the shelves, there would be nothing left for us.     Books have been around for centuries.  They are passed on, shared, and enjoyed by people all over the world.  Books contain important information, stories, and tales of people's past times.  Therefore, I do not believe that certain books should be banned from libraries.  By taking away books in libraries, you are taking away the author's freedom of speech.  Also, technology is rapidly advancing, and sometime in the future, I think libraries will become extinct.  With all of the new devices we have @DATE1, people can just get their books online.     Magazines are a great tool to advertise and talk about some major topics happening around the world.  Magazines are a great thing to read when you want to catch up on news, sports, or just other miscellanious topics.  With that said, magazines can also be bad for public libraries due to some of the explicit content.  This is a reason on why some people would want to get rid of magazines from libraries, but I don't think they should be banned.  By getting rid of magazines, you take away company's freedom of press, which is a major issue.  Refering to the previous paragraph, technology is growing, and it is very easy to just go and look at news, sports, and other topics on the @CAPS1.  That is why I do not think magazines should be taken out of libraries.     My final discussion is music.  Music has also been around for many centuries and it has done many things.  Music is something everyone can relate to.  No matter who you are, you probably have some favorite band, music artist, or genre of music that you prefer.  By saying this, I do not think music should be taken out of libraries either.  Taking away music is like taking away humans natural culture.  We all enjoy it, but have different versions that we enjoy.  Therefore, I do not think it would be wise to take away music from libraries.     In conclusion, libraries are nothing without all the history, stories, news, and music that is inside of it.  Censoring the libraries would not be a good idea and it would most likely upset many people.  It is true that with technology that libraries @MONTH1 eventually become extinct.  Until that happens, I hope they do not censor their materials.",4,4
3397,"One person's strong negative opinion effects everyone else.  That doesn't seem logical or fair.  A library is a sanctuary for people to go read their favorite books for free, containing books from all types of genres.  There is a book for everyone in the library; it's a matter of finding it.  Therefore, finding a book offensive or unsuitable does not give one the right to take that privaledge away from everyone else.     Books have a way of putting our mind at ease, whether that's because it's an escape or measured on how enjoyable it is to read.  Books found offensive to one person could have a completely different impact on the next reader; some @MONTH1 even find the books relatable.  For example, if there was a scene that one reader thought was too graphic or horrific for other readers, there @MONTH1 be someone out there who would find this scene enjoyable because they can relate to it.  People who aren't capable of relating to such a scene would only find it as inappropriate and try to remove it from another's reach.  One person's opinion is not of any more importance than the next person's.     The book '@CAPS1' is a professionally written, fictional novel that has been praised for it's quality, hence the numerous awards won.  Although, this book contains a rape scene and numerous other inappropriate events that this woman was succumbed to throughout her life.  Even so, it is still on the list of suggested college level reads for @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 classes.  It is disappointing to think that people nowadays focus on the graphic scenes in a novel, versus the exceptional writing style.  If all readers were able to look past the surface amoung these scenes, less books would be contemplated on shelf removal.  One person's negative interpretation of a novel effects everyone else's right concerning the censorship in libraries.     Readers are fully warned beforhand of the maturity of the contents.  The books are ranked, critiqued, summarized (back cover summary), and even sorted in a library.  If one finds a book offensive, look in a different section.  Books are sorted by genre for that reason as well; different genres apeal to different people.  This applies to the maturity of the reader as well.  Books are sorted according to what appeals to what age.  If you find a book offensive, instead of having it removed from the shelf altogether, look in a section for younger peoples, or a different genre completely.  If someone finds the book offensive, the fault is not of the book being there, but of the person being in the wrong section.     The main problem concerning book censorship in libraries is not the content, but how the interpretations differenciate towards such content.  On this issue, the other readers' opinions on specific books being removed are being significantly overlooked.  For one to complain about a book's contents automatically give someone else the right to protect the book's contents.  For libraries to remove books in order of censorship is viewed as favoritism and is completely against the rights @LOCATION1 has stood for",4,4
4495,"In my opinion, censorship of any kind shouldn't exist, especially in libraries.           Libraries are where anyone can go and check out a book, @CAPS1, magazine, or movie. It's where the poor can have access to the same materials the better off have. If you take away opinions in books, music, film or magazine/newspaper articles, then you're taking away the author's right to freedom of speech just because someone deemed it offensive.           The right to free speech is an important one in the @LOCATION1, we can have opinions here, we can choose our beliefs, and if someone wants to share their beliefs and opinions by form of writing, then they should be allowed.          Writing is a form of expression, writers can express their thoughts, use their imagination to come up with fantasy worlds and unique characters. Who does one think they are to say it's offensive? Who gets to decide that this book of movie is offensive?          If we take away books that one person finds 'offensive', we wouldn't have anything to read. Some people @MONTH1 find the @CAPS2 offensive, but we still put that in libraries, some people @MONTH1 find books on wizardry and vampires offensive, yet those are all rage now, we wouldn't take those away.     Things that people find offensive are just opinions--just like the ones of those of the writers. It just simply wouldn't work out--if you want young people to read, you have to give them something to read that will stimulate their interests, and sometimes that @MONTH1 be 'offensive.",4,4

It shouldnt be alounded because it can hurt someones feelings.                  I have my own observations with reading some books from my school librarie and have came acrossed some words that was offensive. like in some books they use the word nigger and since im black it's offensive to me i know that they are not saying it to me but they still say it and it kinda touches me in a way. Im not sayin that it is offensive towards all people but it is me so the way they could is like i said instead of having offensive books out on shelves they should have one area where materials like that could be found in stead of having the material where childeren  and other people will get offened.           The last thing i wanna talk about is that for childeren and other people they dont wanna see nasty things that are in books if i had a kid i wouldnt want my childeren too c nasty things that could be offensive to. @CAPS1 books also that talk about drugs and people dont wanna hear or read about that it. but @CAPS1 are some people also that do wanna see or read about things like that like older people they have diffent point of views about things so thats why again @CAPS1 should be one area in libraries for materials like that.     In conclustion i think that @CAPS1 should hear me out and take in what i have to say because the material thats are in books,music, or magazines can be offensive to anybody any race could be offened by what they see or read so again @CAPS1 should be a place in libraries for that",3,3
3341,"Libraries should have whatever they want in the library. Everyone has their on thoughts on things. If you don't like what they have on there shelfs then don't go there any more or pick up something you like. Everyone is different so you can't just take offensive stuff off the shelves, it might be offensive to one person, but not to someone else.      Materials, such as book, music, movies, magazines you can't just start taking stuff of the shelves just because there offensived you. The only way I would say take books or magazines off the shelves is if the facts are not right.       Libraries hold almost anything anybody needs materials, books, music, movies, magazines and everythings for facts. So don't start taking stuff off your shelves. Teenagers might have to write a paper about something that people think is affensive, if you don't have everything in the library then we won't have good facts. No one in this world agrees on anything, all you would be doing would be picking a fight if you taking of offensive.Libraries are open to any one that wants to read about almost anything they want to read about.       Music everybody has there on type of music you can't just start taking music of because you think it's offensive. Most people have there own type of everything.     Children is there own person you can keep them from whatever you want to, the thing is you can't hold them back in life. They get older you won't be able to tell them want to do or want not to do. If you keep them from a book or etc they might end up reading it in the long run. Keep you kids safe is inpormant I understand your kids are going to expirects things you don't want them to. Just by taking offensive stuff of the shelves doesn't mean your kids won't fine them some where else.

That means your going to have to not let it get under you skin or get over it.      Things get under people skin to easy. This is why the world don't get along.

3612,"What is a library?  A library is a place you go to that has books, movies, music, magazines, etc.  With these things a person can do research or use for entertainment.  Should there be censorship in libraries?     In my opinion there should be very @CAPS2 censorship in a library.  If there was a complaint about being offended by something in the library and it was removed from the shelf, there would be nothing left to use in the library.  Many people like to go to the library to relax and have some good peace and quiet time and while there at the library they let their minds flow, imaginate, and dream.  They don't worry about being offended by a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 book.     However censorship in a library can be a good thing if used delicately.  For example, moving grown up books to a section where children will not read them and have nightmares about a picture they saw in it.  What I'm trying to say is have censorship in the library, but at a very low standard.  If a library had high censorship and everything was taken off the shelf what is the point of going to the library, it would be an empty room.     If someone is offended by something in the library, depending on how severe they where offended take the appropiate measures.  For instance if something just offended someone unintentionaly leave it where it is, but if something offends someone intentionaly by their race, ethnicity or something like that, it would then be appropriate to take it off the shelf.     Having low censorship in libraries would be good because there would be a good quantity of stuff for you to do your research on and there would be more topics to choose from to let your imagination soar.  While at the same time you would not have to worry about being severely offended",4,3
3068,"I believe that if there are offensive books,music,movies,and magazines are in the libraries. I think they should be taking off the shelf , @CAPS1 people should not want there children's reading or looking at thing they should not be looking at. Today I'm going againt the views on the censorship in the libraries.      I think we should fight for what the libraries should have in the build for our children to read. The materials that the libraries has that are offensive should be put up in another area for older poeple. Not for the children's that go to the libraries. I'm asking the newspaper to help us to fight for what the libraries should have on there shelf for our young people and are children's.      And  what type's of book should be in the children part in the libraries on the shelf. We should have right's to take off book's on  the children side. And have rights to put offensive materials on the side for older people that like books,music,movies,and magazines but not for young children to read. The point I'm trying to make is that we should think about what our children's should be learn.     And what they should know as a young person. They should not grow up to fast like some people are .We need to make the better for our young children's. So they can do the same for there self and for there children's some day.",2,2
4222,"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I disagree with Katherine Paterson's statement because there is a @CAPS1 to @CAPS2 and the @CAPS1 to Write. The author obviously had a purpose to write the novel, compose the music, or to deliver the movie. There will always be items that will be offensive to some people, but to others there is a meaning behind it.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 gives everyone the right to speak what is on their mind. That @CAPS1 allows them to publish whatever they have to say in a novel, a piece of music, or in a movie. Sure there @MONTH1 be some parts that @MONTH1 be inappropriate somewhere in a novel, piece of music, or a movie, but that doesn't mean the whole item will be inappropriate. Some people might think some things can be offensive while others don't at all. There maybe somethings out there in this world that you @MONTH1 think are offensive, but have you stood up and told that company yourself?      Being able to put down anything on paper that you want everyone to know about is the @CAPS1 to write. With that you can't be told not to do so. For example, the '@CAPS6' magazine maybe offensive to an abundent number of parents who don't want their kids to look at it, but that magazine isn't intended for children to look at. That magazine's purpose is to show adults what is all out there to buy to make their appearance sexy. It's not to be offensive to anyone and that company has the @CAPS1 of write to publish such a thing. The @CAPS1 to write serves its own purpose to all of the writers, composers, directors, and anyone who wants to write in a journal or to write a note.      I bet there has been a novel, a piece of music, or a movie that you just love. Well within it there most likely was a piece of information that was inappropriate, but would you like to see that taken off of the shelf? For example, I once read a series when I was in middle school that had inappropriate content about sexual interaction, but that series is what every girl wanted to read. If they would have taken them off the shelf because they were not appropriate then I know plenty more novels that would be gone as well.         What would you say if there was nothing left on the shelves to read, listen to, or to watch? Without items such as books we could have a hard time learning new stuff all the time. These are the items that teach us new things everyday. Would you be able to enjoy your life without being able to read, watching movies or @CAPS7 shows, or listening to music? It would be a very hard thing to get used to in today's society. We rely on such things @NUM1 to get us through the day and teach us things we were never taught.     Disagreeing with the quote that Katherine Paterson stated is one way to use @CAPS1 of @CAPS5 by stating my view of removing inappropriate items off of shelves. Removing items of the shelves won't solve the proplem of having too much inappropriate usage in today's society. If everything that had some kind of inapporpriate content in it removed from shelves, we would have a hard time finding a novel to read, music to listen to, a magazine to enjoy, and a movie or @CAPS7 show to watch. Lots of schools rely of books to read and without a book childrens vocabulary could have a great downfall.  Think about it...what would you be able to do in your free time if we had no more books, movies, magazines, or music",4,4
4350,"Taking 'offensive' books from the shelves of libraries is like taking away the right of speech.  There is not a point to it. People in this country have the right of speech. Along with that comes the right to have your voice be heard.  An author's opinions @MONTH1 be offensive to some but does that mean he or she should not have a voice?  Writers get their ideas from somewhere society plays a huge role in what ideas these authors conjer up, taking these books away will not change the way people think and feel, and most importantly citizens of the @LOCATION1 have the right to make their own choices; that being if you don't like a book don't check it out.     Writers @MONTH1 state things that to some degree @MONTH1 offend one in a million people.  Others see it as freedom of speech and writing.  An author who writes a story that involves sex is not trying to extend their writing and thoughts to second graders.  But if a person has a problem with the way the author sees the world walking out their front door will show that same thing.  Some books @MONTH1 be fictional but that does not mean they don't get ideas from somewhere else.  Society plays a big part in the ideas and thoughts of most writers.  So when they write a book that has 'inappropriate' actions in it they got it from the way people truly are in the world.       Banning a book from the library that has a sex scene or provacitive language does not --by any means-- make the world stop having sex and saying curse words. Kids are learning this through hearing their parents swear or their peers in class talking about sex.  Reading a book about it will not change the fact that they are still learning about it in many other ways.  If the books that swear were no longer on library shelves society still will not change.  There is no perfect society.     Setting a book on a shelf with offensive language does not cause harm to anyone.  If an idividual doesn't like the way an author expresses themselves through their writing that person should not check that author's books out from the library.  No single person is forced to read a book they are offended by.  Getting rid of a book because of an unhappy parent does nothing but waste paper and intelligence. The library is not liable for the feelings of the readers.  If the reader does not like the book they are able to close it.  No one has glued their fingers to it.       Many people in today's world would agree that banning books from our public libraries will not have as much of an effect as some would like it to.  Banning books is an unknowledgeable thing to do to keep your kids from learning bad things.  Society shows that the writers are getting their ideas from somewhere, taking these books away will not take away the way people think and behave, and if some one does not like a book they should not read it",4,4
4188,"I do believe that certain materials should be taken of the shelves if they are found offensive. I think children should only be able to read certain books cause, some books say things should know until they get older.Some books, music, movies , magazines should be removed if offensive. I think they shouldnt make some kids movies , books, music like that for little kids. They put to many things they should not  in kids movies.     The movie the @CAPS1 they should not let kids watch that movie its not a movie i would let my kids see until they was older.The reason why is cause it has alot of  bad language in it . It is about these guys who take ruphies. This guy cheats on his girlfriend, and it is just not a movie that i would let my kids watch.There are people getting drunk in the movie . they do stupied things.They try to make it look like its a good thing to do and that it is so fun to do all those things. I just think that is not a movie to let kids watch.   Some music has to much bad language in it. I think they should make better songs for kids. Songs that really mean something or about someone. Most of these songs they sing now is about dumb things that do not mean anything.I think some magazines are okay to read but some just talk about actors. Like @PERSON1 I read one time about here doing something that was bad, and she should not be doing. I think it depends on what the magazine is and what it talks about in it.   I believe that if they are offensive they should be taken of the shelves. I also think that if they are not offensive and do not talk about bad things kids should be able to see them or read them. If they did that kids would not talk and do things like they do today.That  kids would not try to stell and things like they do in these movies they see it happen or there friends do it. So they think it is cool for them to go out and do things like that but, it is not.",3,3
3471,"Censorship in public libraries, allowed? I believe it should be, with a few different veiw points. For one, why should the books come off of shelves because some people do not like the plot of the series? Two, @CAPS1 is over a million of us people out @CAPS1 and we all are not a like in many ways. Also @CAPS2, reading is one of those things that we differ with each other. One person might read peaceful warm-hearted stories, than you have people out @CAPS1 like want something more intense to be able to read.      With all of us being different all over the world. Humans have different taste in food, music, movies, and books. All people have different ways to satisfy their pleasures in book readings, to me books are like religons not all of us are the same in that, and at the same time we are all freely living with our reglion without any punichment, so why would you take away books that people love to read freely?  To me, in my eyes is just not right. It's like taking candy away from a innocent baby because it will rot it's teeth out. What I mean by that is, that sure some books to people @MONTH1 offend them yet their might be some people out @CAPS1 being offensive to that persons books and so on, but as all as your baby's teeth aren't rotting out, than why take the candy away? Meaning if the books have each individal shelf with labels on what it was all about, which they do. People wouldn't feel so offensive finding them in the wrong spot.     Looking at the point of veiws do you understand where I come from with this? We are all the same, yet in books we find each other inside of them, finding ourselves into books, I know many book readers with different types of tastes. No matter who they were and who their friends were, we all are different. To many people other than myself, would agree with that. So tell me again why should censorship not be in public libraries",3,3
3625,"Censorship at  the library is not needed at all times. It is the parents who should take the books away from the kids. It isn't the libraries job to tell people what to do. There are certin cases when it's needed though.     It's the parent's job to tell the kids what to do. They are the ones in charge of the kids. they are the ones who should tell teach them right from wrong. They are the ones who are raising the kids, not the library. Other wise, they parents are having their job done for them.     The libraries have the right to get what ever books they want as long as there isn't anything really bad in them. I do get it if they pull off books, movies, and magizines for adults, but if there is one little word in there, people will just have to get over it.     Isn't that why people are wanting classic books, such as '@CAPS1 @CAPS2's @CAPS3' and 'The @CAPS4 of @ORGANIZATION1,' changed? Because black people find it offensive? It's not rignt. People are trying to rewrite history; to sugar-coat the truth. Well, the books are like the real world. People aren't always going to be nice to you. They can be down right mean some times. The whole world is just corupted.     There shouldn't be a problem with just one little bad word in great works of liturature. People will cuss you out if they feel like it while in books, the language limited to one or two bad words. They shouldn't be trying to change great books because the minority find it offensive. The library shouldn't be the ones who tell us what we can and can not read. The library shouldn't censor their books.",3,3
3151,"The entertainment for children and adults consists of movies, music, sports, video games, and reading. Books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from any shelf at any time. Libraries censor some material because of violence or inappropriate material. Children should have the right to read, listen, or watch whatever they want to because it's their life. Books, magazines, music, and movies can teach young people about life and the writers, artists, directors, and actors have worked extremely hard on entertaining the people..      The materials found 'offensive' should not be removed. These materials can be found helpful to others. Reading material can help a young person with life. If the reader is having problems and needs help, it is possible the book he/she is reading @MONTH1 help them in the thinking process on what they should do. The books, movies, and music have been made by extremely hard workers, so why take away their hard work by removing their material just because a couple of people have found it offensive.      One of the many times i went to the library I was looking for a book I had read before but I could not find it. I could not find it because someone else found it inappropriate and had asked that the book be removed from the shelf. This hurt me because that book was one of my favorite books to read. Some books found 'offensive' or 'inappropriate' and taken off the shelves could be another person's favorite book to read. Why take it off the shelf? People are being too much self-centered. They care about themself and that is it.      The material being taken off the shelves should be put back on the shelves for the readers who find the material entertaining. If a parent does not want their child reading a certain book then they have the authority to take the book away from that child, not the shelves. Freedom of the @CAPS1 states that the anybody has the right to write whatever the he/she wants to write.  If we keep taking books, magazines, music, or movies off of the shelves then we're going to get to the point to where there are no books on any shelf",3,3
3157,"If something is to be found offensive, than it should certainly be removed from the shelves. When parents send or take their children to a library, they do not expect their child to be able to pick up something that is not appropriate. Some items @MONTH1 offend someone's beliefs and be rude. Public libraries are just that, public. Everything there will be seen by the public and large masses of people. No one should have to worry about being offended when they walk into a place of learning and knowledge.     Parents do not want their child going to the library and picking up rude materials. Even if the child does not check the book or magazine out, who is to stop that young, impressionable mind from flipping through the pages. Perhaps he or she reads something that his or her parents did not intend on teaching them for some time. Books now have a lot of crude text and humor. If there is a topic that a younger individual is not mature enough to understand, he or she @MONTH1 get the wrong impression or ideas about the subject.      If a kid is rumaging through the more adult section of the library, they might be expossed to some information they are not ready for. Offensive language @MONTH1 be present in the books and now the young person will see them and try to use the words or phrases. If a child read something about sex, he or she might be curious or confused, and ask their parents about it. The parents on the other hand, might not have wanted their child to know about the topic at such a young age. At that point there would be no turning back. Parents would have to explain things that are too mature for some young minds.     Parents have every right to deny minors and children certain materials, but if the books are out in open, who will censor what is looked at by whom. Libraries need to put serious thought into what is on the shelves, no matter what form the information is in. People @MONTH1 think just because the story was in a book, than of course it can't be real. Some reckless senarios are played out in movies. Those movies are watched by people of all ages. If an impressionable teenager watches a movies that has offensive language or violent scenes, that teen might act upon what they've seen.     Since the public library is indeed public, the materials it offers to people should not be offensive. All sorts of individuals walk into a library and look around. No one should ever walk out a library with the feeling of being offended. No parent should have to worry about what their child might pick up. Libraries should not cause worry or harm in any way.",4,4

I think that if books, movies, music, magazines,or anything else is offensive, then we shouldnt have them in libraries because its not right, and its @CAPS2 cuel, and people shouldn't putting those things there if there insalting to others or mean to them. In my experenice, I have had that happen where I cheaked out a book on something and it turned out very Offensive to me. It was at the @ORGANIZATION1 when I was @NUM1 years old. My parents and I where there for some movie or something, and we were looking at some books that were there, and came across a book called' @CAPS4 in @LOCATION1 ' And it was offensive to me because @CAPS5 was the reglion I was raised in, and they @CAPS2 talked about there feelings on faith, and how they thought of it. And it made me hurt because I go to chruch and read the @CAPS6-I-@CAPS6-@CAPS8-@CAPS9. And i was raised on a type of faith that I know alot about. And if you read that book, it made my question everything i belived.      So to rap up my thoughts and feelings. I think it shouldn't be there for people to read, like i said before. People have other books they can have there instead of one that are offensive poeple. All in all I hope you think about my persuassive letter, and tell them about your thoughts and ideas too.",2,3

Do I belive that books, music, movies, magazines, and anything else in any book shelves or any other shelves that is offensive to anyone should be removed. I think this because nobody should be offended by anything. Everyone should not live offended by anything or anyone.      I just explaned and talked about if the offensive things in shelves should be removed, and I answerd yes. I also talked about the introduction, a boby, and introduction",2,2
4329,"You are the mother or father of a young child, and you take them to the library. While there, you see some advertising for a new book. The sign is all bright and flashy, so you stop to read it. It turns out to be advertising a book and some movies that you believe should not even be available here, for they are far to inappropriate and offensive. What would you do?      Personally, I believe that if you see something like that, that you believe is offensive, you should say something. Talk to the librarian and state your case about what is going on. Having offensive articles in a public library where kids of all ages go to do their homework, is just plain wrong.      What if that certain library had no restrictions on who checked out what? So many kids could check things like that out, and not even know what it actually is! Could you imagine your child coming home from the library, and handing you a book, magazine, or movie that was way beyond anything they should ever see at that age? It would be disasterous! I @MONTH1 not have children, but I do have younger cousins. I know for a fact that if they brought home something inapproproate or offensive, their parents would be having a major talk with the librarian.     Libraries should have major restrictions on what gets checked out by who. For example, my library has three different kinds of library cards. One card is just to check out regular books. Another is so you can check out movies, music, and books. Then the third and final card is so you can check out books, music, and movies from the adult section in a small room at the back of the library. However, to even be eligible for the third card, you have to be eighteen or older.      I strongly believe that if a library does carry materials some @MONTH1 find offensive, they need to be kept in a small room at the back of the library, or behind the librarians desk. This way, noone who does not want to see the materials doesn't have to. If someone did want to see or check out these materials, they should need proof that they are eighteen or older. This would make it easier for the librarian to keep track of who looks at or checks out the materials.     Another thing, what if someone finds something offensive that someone else doesn't? Well, I honestly think that at least two or three people should comment on it being inappropriate or offensive, before it is actually taken off the shelf. If more than one person does say something, the librarian should place the book, magazine, movie, music, ect., in with the other offensive materials, where there is an age restriction.      This is how it is at my neighboorhood library, and I strongly believe that this library is a model for all libraries wanting to have more restrictions. If all libraries had more restrictions, it would be better off for everyone. Parents would not have to worry about their young children wandering around and finding something that is totally wrong for them. Older teenagers and young adults would be able to get their homework or projects accomplished without having all the distractions of the offensive materials.      In conclusion, I hope you take all that I have said to heart. I hope you write an article talking about the restrictions in libraries, and how they would make everything better off. Thank you for taking the time to read this",4,4
3852,"A library is a public place for all ages. They have many different kinds of books for specific reasons. For the children they have a nice comfy spot for them to pick a book and sit down and read it. For adults they have coffe tables, sofa seats, and many different things while they read their books. never should a library have to disclousre certain materials because of the ages that come in and out.              Censoring a library would not make it any easier to keep young children away from certain materials that are offensive. I feel that when a child is in a library they should go to their specific areas for which they came for, they should also be monitored while in the library. Most kids woldn't go to a book that doesn't have a lot of pictures or colors in it any way. The library is a public place and is made for all ages, even though there are book stores that sell just adult books, movies, and magazines, they still shouldn't throw them out of a library. There should be equal rights all over, yes even in libraries.     The world is full of offensive things period. Now while a child a is not within a library they could be at home or in a public place and see things that they could also see in a book at the library. The removal of certain books, movies, and magazines wouldn't really stop anything. I think that if the parents teach thier children right from wrong there is nothing wrong with them being in a library that has adult books, movies, and magazines. If I owned a library I personally would not mind all kinds of books that are appropriate to a certain exstint in my selction of books. I have been to plenty of libraries and have seen stuff that I thought shouldn't be in thier but at the same I was not in my right section or doing what I was supposed to be doing. This subject really doesn't bother me, so no I don't think they should remover certain books just because children are in the library.",3,3
3684,"Have you ever watched a movie that had some scenes you didnt't want your kids to watch with you? What are you suppose to do when this problem happens time and time agian? Do you just tell your kids to close there eyes and cover there ears? Well i honestly think that shouldn't ever have to happen to you.     I think that you as a parent or adult should be warned about certain behaviors during a moive. That you do not approve your child of watching even if it is with you ,it's just flat out wrong I would say. So i say that we should get some kind of extra warning that these innapporiate behaviors are showing up in movies. Parents should be able to know what there kinds are bout to watch is ok for there age and what not.      So to wrap this all up nice and sweet. Just make some kind of label that says that there might be things in the movies or whatever item such as books and magazines also. That there might be things that a parent will find innapporiate for a child to watch or read. If the people that make these products do this it will be much more easier for parents to do the right thing for there children",3,3
3018,"Dear Newspaper,      I beleive that no book should be taken off the selfs for nay reason. People @MONTH1 not be mature enough for some books, music, magazines, etc., and so the libraries that have a problem with some of the materials then maybe they should put a limit to age on checking out certain things. Libraires keep all types of books and magazines so what would be their reason to take the material off the self? I think that there are different types of people in the world and everyones going to wnat to read something different.        If libraries are going to take the material off the self that people don't like then the material that others like would be gone. For instance,if i were to take the '@CAPS1' series off the selves then all the '@CAPS1' fans would be ferious and upset. But knowing that lots of people like the series, my library isn't going to do that. There is alot of books that parents don't want their children to read, but libraries arn't going to take them off the selfs.     Some parents arn't going to want their children and teenagers to read a romantic, rasy book but thats what other adults enjoy reading. Those books arn't going to go away but if parents have problems with it then maybe they should mention to the library to put an age limit to them. The parents could also check on what their child or teenager is reading. But those books will be in libraries forever and you can't make them go away because you don't want you're chilren to read them.     From experiance, I've read a couple racy books and they are disturbing for me, being an imatture addiunce. But i'm not going to ask for the books to be taken off the self. Some books are very vulger and nasty in the ways they discribe fights or wars or abuse but some people like readinf lititure like that so the libraries will keep them. If peoplehave problems with books then stay away from them and don't read them. Its as simple as that.      In conclusion, I think all books should stay on the shelves because all people have different interest and opinions. If anyone has a problem with a book for being racy or vulgur then they shouldn't ready that book, and if they dont want their childrena and teenagers to read the book either then they should be a parent and not let them. They can't blame the library for books they don't want their kids to read because thats not fair to the people who enjoy those books and like to read them.

There are many books etc that kids should read, but you can tell your kids not to read them, or if they do start to read them take the book away from them.      There are some books that kids shouldn't read, but only you can stop them from reading them. They willl always try to find away to get what they want. so taking books off the shelf wouldn't do any good, because they'll find the book movie ets somehow. The only way to make such is to keep your kids over watch, and to make such they do son't the stuff you don't want them to do.         In conculusion taking books off the shlef would't help anyone out, but just try to keep your kids away from the stuff you  don't want them to be around",3,2
4059,"Many people have different views and opinions on things. No opinion or view is right or wrong. Books, music, and movies of controversy shouldn't be removed from shelves because not everybody finds them offensive, people have the right to view them, and others can't make the desicion for everyone.     Everybody is entitled to their own views and opinions, but they can't make others see things their way. If someone was at a library, and thought the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series were offensive, they might be the only ones to think that. They can't tell the library to remove them because they're uncomfortable with the books. Things go by majorty rule, and that person is not the majorty. They're the only one with the problem.     Everyone has the right to view or listen to what they want, as long as it's legal. If someone finds a type of music that they find offensive, they can't tell the store to remove it. One person can't change everything to fit their needs. They would be making plenty of people unhappy if that type of music was removed. To make everyone happy, the person could just not listen it. There's a huge selection of music a person could listen to, without being uncomfortable.     One person cannot make the desicions for everyone. The president doesn't even make the desicions by himself; he has the government helping him. If one person felt as if a magazine was inappropriate, they don't have the right to change it. They're not the one in charge so they can't be the one to change the magazine. It might be inapprpriate, but other people enjoy reading it.      I believe that everyone's entitled to their own opinions and views, but they shouldn't make everyone see it their way. Books, music, movies, and magazines are few of the things that people try to control because they're uncomfortable with the subject inside the material. Some of the stuff is inappropriate or offensive, but one person can't change it. Not everybody will find it offensive, people have the right to view, watch, or listen to what they want, and one person can't make desicions for everyone",4,4
4520,"Censorship          Should certain materials (books, music, movies, magazines, etc.,) be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? I think it depends on how offensive the material actually is. If it is something very provacative or racist or advanced beyond the years of the people who have access to it, then it shouldn't be allowed. Or, the materials should be restricted or placed in a special section that only certain people have access to. It depends on the level of intelligence, maturity, and age of the people who have access to these materials.          I don't think these materials should be removed, but restricted. Some of it should be left up to the school or library, but it is also a responsibility of the parents. If a child has permission to access a certain material, then they should be allowed to if their guardian thinks it is appropriate. Sometimes the guardians views @MONTH1 not be the same as a the library or schools, but it's mostly up to the guardian. Schools and libraries can't really argue with people's morals or intelligence.           Over all, I don't think materials such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed unless it has been deemed necessary by a group of people that includes parents, teachers and/or school board memebers, and/or library staff. Just because one mom thinks a book is innapropriate for her child, doesn't mean it should be banned from another. Everyone has a different opinion and idea of what's acceptable, therefore it isn't fair for everyone to have to go by the idea of only one person.                If you don't want your child to have access to a certain material, then simply don't let them access it. If you think it's not an appropriate material for any child to access, you can express that, but others @MONTH1 not agree. Materials considered innapropriate by a respectable group should be restricted or have a warning on them, but not a ban.",4,3
4679,"In libraries there should be a control over what certain kind of books, magazines, or movies that children should be able to read.  For instance movies, are we going to go let a @NUM1 year watch a rated @CAPS1 movie much less let him/her watch a porn movie. No thats just plain wrong. That goes with magazines and books. Magazines have some images that aren't appropriate for the right age bracket that can easily pick it up and look at it.  Books as well kids have very imaginative minds, they @MONTH1 not have pictures in them but still kids know a little more than what we give them credit for.     Me, I would know this because as a little kid my brothers got a rated @CAPS1 film called '@CAPS3's @CAPS4'. After watching all @NUM2 of the films that were available at the time, I just could not look at a doll the same way again.  Whenever my mom would get rid of a doll she used to own some of them had eyes that would move. I always sat at one side of the car while the doll would be as far away from me aas possible.     To prevent other kids from experiencing what I did local libraries ought to create sections in the library where you've got your children section, the teen section, and the adult section. So then you can easily tell the kids to only go to either the teen section or the kids section.  This should be the way to organize the films and magazines as well.  I know some people wouldnt agree with my ideas but I have to ask them in return. Do you have any better ideas?     Now for getting rid of stuff in our library that can be offensive. I would say we keep it, our kids need to know our culture that way they can survive in it. They need to know that there are still racists out there even though society tries to cover it up.  There's no way there going to be able to keep other people's opinions from coming ears length of the @CAPS3.  If our children are to grow up maturley they need to experience or at least know what bullying is.  Maybe learn what an athiest is or find out on their own what a sexist is.  Some of it is inappropriat'e so i will agree that kids need to find this out at a certain age but you can't keep it out of their lives forever.  Thats why its best not to throw the books out that mention those sort of things.",4,4
3923,"Books, movies, magazines, or music that is offensive in any way should not be aloud to be showed to the public. If these offensive things were not aloud to be showed I personally think it would help out are country is full of racist people and documents.      Everytime you pick up a magazine or you watch a television show about a famous actress or musician you see embarrassing aspects of their lives all over the world. This is not right at all! People should be shown respect and allowed to have some privacy in there life. If it wasn't for actress and musicians we wouldn't have any television shows to watch. There would be no use to have radio's. There would be no reason to, their would be nobody to sing songs for us. Why would we want to embarrass these guys anyways? They work their tails off to produce new things for us.     Books in the libraries should not have sexual assualts in them at all. Books like this in school libraries have no reason to be there. Why would you want your child to read something like that out of a book in the school? Expecially foul language in materials at school. Books at the library should have good examples in them not vaulgar sayings. This is a disgrace to the school.      Movies are a big concern. Any child or young adult could go into the movie section and get any type of movie even if it is rated restricted. Would you want your child brining home a movie that had nudity in the film? I remember one time my little sister brought home a movie from are local library. This movie was a total disgrace to this library it had nudity, foul language, and lots of violence. I couldn't believe what I had just saw. My library would have something like this in the library? Children go there and pick movies out. My mother had went in and made a complaint about the restricted movies being in with the children films. She said that the movies should be seprate from the rest. You should have to be a certain age to rent this movie. Or atleast have a parents permission.     Every local library or school library should be taking action in doing this for their community. Lets keep are children and young adults away from violence. By allowing this in are school libraries and local libraries it is just saying it's ok to letting this violence in. We should put a stop to it and prevote good attitudes. So please take the violence off the shelf",4,3
3879,i think censorship is stupid when it comes to putting it on adult show's. i can see why they put it on the kid's show's.. but like really?you guys will put that stuff on good movies? or song's!? what has ever happened to freedom of speech?,1,1
4553,"Have you ever had a book, movie, or magazine offend you? Have you ever wished that no one else will ever have to read it? Should those offensive materials be removed from libraries? I don't think they should. The books, movies, and other materials should be marked saying that they @MONTH1 be found offensive.      From my own experience I know how easily one can be offended by a book or movie. Many times I have read a book that has completely contradicted my religion. Most times I will ignore it and move on to a better book or movie. Sometimes it is harder to ignore. I always try to forget and move forward with my life, as others should do.      Have you ever read the book The @CAPS1? If you have you are aware that there are some ideas in this book that bring up many controversies. One example from the book would be when they kill some of the children. Most people, like myself, do not agree with this idea. They think that it is wrong. Again some people @MONTH1 try to get this book banned, but it is still a wonderful literature.     As you @MONTH1 have seen in the media lately, many people are trying to get the book @CAPS2 @CAPS3 removed from schools. Some people have found the book as offensive because it repeatedly refers to native americans by a more profound word. The law has not passed yet and has remained in schools. The law hasnt passed because it does not affect everyone. Some people @MONTH1 not find this offensive. Therefore it was not removed.      Removing offensive books from libraries is the exact same thing. Some people @MONTH1 find the books offensive while others @MONTH1 not. Removing the books from everyone's reach would be appauling. The book @MONTH1 only be offensive to one race or religion. Why not simply put a warning label for that race or religion? That would take care of the problem by putting the decision of reading it and being offended in their hands. Possibly it isnt that the books are offensive to a race or religion, maybe it is to an age group. If that is the problem then the librarians can put those books in the appropriate age section.      I have given reasons from my own experiences, other readings, and my obersavations in the media. I only hope that you consider my ideas. Do not remove the books from the shelf only because it is offensive to one person. Simply put a warning label on the book after a few complaints. This would put the responsibility of being offended in thier hands. Once again I do not think that offensive materials should be removed from our libraries only censored to the people of whom it is offensive",4,4
4592,"If there was a book on a shelf that I found offensive, I would want it removed, but then again I wouldn't. Every one has there own opinions and there own view on things. Mine are different from every one elses'. I mean I @MONTH1 find it offensive, but how is everyone else going to see if it is or not, if you take it off the shelf?     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion. What we do, believe in, or think is what makes us ourselves. Just because one person finds a book, music, or some movies offensive, doesn't mean everyone else will. Others might happen to like it even if you don't.     Taking something away just because you think it is offensive, is like taking a little part of some one away. It's like the school making kids wear uniforms, it takes our individuality away. We all have to have some way to express ourselves and maybe the thing you find offensive, expresses some one else in some way.    There is going to be a lot of things in life that people don't like, but can you really just get rid of it all? It does not work like that. You are not always going to have your way in life, but it's life and there is nothing you can do about it. Just because you don't like something or you find something offensive, doesn't mean you can just remove it or replace it.     Life just goes as planned and there will be things that you don't like, but you can't change that. It is life and replacing or removing things won't make things easier. So if I found something offensive, I'd just ignore it and leave it there because is taking it off the shelve really going to help?",4,4
3959,"If there is any books, movies, music or magizines that is offensive, then I think it should be removed from the bookshelf because of caution for little kids. Everyone wants to look at different movies, books or music that isn't right for kids, but we all have too know where kids get acts from. The books can be left on the shelf, if the younger kids does not bother them. They have to know that adults don't always want to watch kids shows. There should be a right that adults can remove books from the shelf if its not right for there kids. Yes, books, magazines, movies and music should be left off the shelf if offensive. This is neccasary because they can watch the movies and learn bad habits from the shows, listen to the music and learn bad words, and look at magazines and see bad pictures. So have kids stay away from offensive materials.           There is a lot of younger kids that love to get into stuff they are not suppose to. Such as bad movies not for their age, because kids learn their bad habits from t.v. shows or even movies. If the movie is offensive then it should definantly stay off the shelfs. Inless it is just grown ups in the house. If movies are just laying on the on the shelf or around the house. Younger kids could always just grab them not knowing what it is and go watch it in there room.           Horrible music is just as bad, because they can listen to it and get their bad language from the @CAPS1. If parents don't want there kids growing up to be bad people then I advice all parents to keep the worse @CAPS2 away from children and hide them all. They can always hide them in the rooms, in a desk draw for child safety. Have all kids stay away from offensive and bad items they are not aloud to be around.      Magazines are bad to look at if they have pictures not neccasary for children. Watch all children around the magazines or look at the magazines before allowing them to read it. There @MONTH1 be disgusting pictures that children can not see that young. So make sure they all stay clear and far away from them.      I would keep all items away from young children at all times, if they are not good. Just watch all children around magazines, movies, and music. All of these materials, all children can learn bad habits from. If they are not offensive then don't worry about them getting them to watch them, because it wont be bad. They all want to live a life sometime and act like they are adults. So, sometimes you have to treat them like an adult. Yes, make sure all books, music, movies and magazines all stay away from young children if they are offensive. Movies needs to stay away from children because they can learn bad habits from the shows, music needs to stay away from young children because they can learn bad language, and magazines needs to stay away from young children also because they can look at bad pictures they arn't suppose too.",3,4
4135,I believe that this idea is not a good idea because some of the the students would need that information to look up ideas that they would need to write about in a report or to right in a final. The reason the libary is here for the students to have and take there advantge to put time in to looking up what they need for their classes.knowing me I put the time that I need to do my work in class so i know what is need in the report so I know im doing it right and not just making up something that I could just stick in the report.   I see that it is imporant to keep the materials in the libary to have the convence to have thing that is needed to have to look  up a celebrity that is inporant to keep in touch with . If your writing in the news paper you are needed to the infomation that you  can get  your hands on to keep all the students informed in how there celebrity is living there live. If students are ready to graduate and there needing to go on line to look up type of colleges that they could attend before leaveing @ORGANIZATION1 so they could be prepard to be ready in the world they were set out to be living in to start a live and acomplish thing that our parents didnt get to do.    The intrest of the libary to inspire some of the readers in the class to go out and read book that can show the situation on how your health benifits are by looking in the cancer book for information from how the sun and  going to the tanning bed can cause skin cancer and can hurt your skin just by makeing your self look older by gettingas tanner.   I think the situation of the libary is to be use to  for our education and our benifits to learn more from book and reading it a lots interesting than just watching a show or a rerun of a tv show or even movies that show all the action in a movie that you can get from a book with more details,2,3
4336,"I dont believe that we should sencor or take away any thing off of out library shelves that seems either offensive or inappropriet for veiwers, but I wouldent recomend it for the kids who are not ready for that sort of material untill they are at the age of where they are ready for that sort of viewing.     The reason why I say this is because that I believe and know that people sooner or later are going tho see, hear, and go through that sort of that viewing and/or experience sometime in their lives, it has happend to many people and it will continue to happen to everyone in their lives.     The events that happen to many people are awful but yet are true, @CAPS1 that go around in the world should be known to other people and why, so people can know how to deal with the situation or at least know what to do, we should know how to go-by when some cerntian events go through like an example; if a cerntian person of race and is minding his own bisnuess passes a group of race appressers and they began offending him by words then he shouldent worry. Because if a person is only going to constantly use words then you should know that he/she is just a weak person just trying to get on your nervs and wont do any physical harm to you.     There are many @CAPS1 that people dont like and try their best to hide it from others, but that would only make @CAPS1 worse for everybody and would lead them clueless if some people got exposed to what some people attend to hide; We shouldent hide @CAPS1 from others and keep them from not knowing what has happend or what is going on and leaving them clueless.      I believe that nothing should be held back for the people who are ready to see or know what is going on, no matter how crule or painful it is, they should know what it is and how to take care of them selves when thell experience it at first hand.",3,3
4303,"Reading is very popular. It is something to do when you are sitting at home and also when you are in the classroom. School libraries are filled with defferent varieties of books and magazines and such. Some of these books could be arguably offensive to some people. These books should not be taken away from the library shelves.      There are some books that some people find so offensive that they can not even continue to read the rest of the book. Whether it be sexual or even political, if the reader finds it offensive they will not read the rest of the book. There are books out there that describe in detail sexual scenes and many parents do not want their kids to read these kinds of books. This is no reason to remove the books from the library shelves. It @MONTH1 be offensive to certain people but if you took it off of the shelves it would not be available for others to read who can handle that kind of story. Parents' kids should simply not read these books. Libraries can not take the books away all together from readers who enjoy these kinds of books.           There are also books about politics. Majority of people stand firm with politics and do not budge when it comes to discussing what they believe is right or true. When a reader comes across a book that is against the way they see politics, there can be a real problem. With politics being a serious matter, many people can overreact when someone tells them what they believe and think is true is really not. Politicians themselves especially. Still, many authors write about political matters and some books can educate the reader about points that they have not yet seen before. If a reader does not agree with what the author is writing or they find it offensive, they should not read the book. There are plenty of other readers out there that would like to read that book and to learn more about politics. If a reader knows that this kind of reading offends them, then they should know better than to pick up the book in the first place.      Many libraries offer music, movies and magazines to check out and to take home. It is true that many of these movies or the lyrics in the songs could strike someone as offensive. For this reason, they should not check them out. Many people enjoy music or movies that have offensive language. It is something that adds to the song or movie. People know their limits and if they know the contents then they should stay away. As long as there are other readers and people who like those kinds of books and music then they should keep them on the shelf. Taking them away would only take away from the number of people who visit the library. You could go to your local library and find people looking through the music section, and the music section is the only reason they come to the library in the first place. The music and movie section should stay in libraries. The people that are checking them out should be mature and responsible enough to know if they find the contents offensive.          Libraries should not take certain books, movies, and magazines away that some people find offensive. Some books and music do have contents that are offensive to some readers and viewers. However, if it is offensive to the first person, it does not mean it will be offensive to the next. The libraries need to keep these sections in their libraries for all different kinds of readers. Reading is an extremely popular activity. Readers want a variety of books, music and movies to choose from.",4,4
4194,"Censorship in libraries is a topic that is argued back and forth in todays society. It is something that we all should think about and voice our opinions about. I believe that items in a library should not be censored based on constitutional @CAPS5, the creation of gray areas, and the depletion of classic literature.     The @CAPS1 @CAPS2 to the @CAPS3 of the @ORGANIZATION1, clearly @LOCATION1 the idea of freedom of the press. Not only does this give publishers the right to print whatever they please, but it also gives people a right to choose for themselves what they can and want to read. Censoring books in a library would be denying this right that is clearly spelled out in the @CAPS4 of @CAPS5. I refuse to support any idea that directly opposes the @CAPS3 and the people of the @LOCATION1 should be appalled that this sort of thing is even in discussion.      When it comes to censoring something based on how offensive something is, one always has to consider the gray areas that will be formed. For instance, what is offensive in one book @MONTH1 not be offensive to someone else who would benefit from reading it. The term 'offensive' is a reletive one, in that the definition varies from person to person. No one thing can be deemed offensive by one hundred percent of the population and therefore no one thing can be removed without opposition. This creates areas of gray where there is no right answer. This would be extremely problamatic for those trying to censor items within  a library. Secondly, the decision on who would get to decide what is and is not offensive would cause as much contreversy as the books themselves. Knowing that every person carries a different opinion the people deciding would have to equally represent every persons' opinion when making a decision, talk about problamatic.      Finally, censoring books would eliminate classic literature and would deplete an understanding of the world through the eyes of great writers. For example, in @PERSON1's '@CAPS7 @PERSON2' the 'n' word appears over one hundred times. Many @CAPS8 @CAPS9 take great offense at the use of this word. However, this book is seen as one of the centuries greatest works and cannot be removed from the education of young people because of an offensive term. If people want to censor books, then censor them from their own children and not the children of others and inevitably an entire population.     In conclusion, the censorship of literature and other items in a library is not only impossible, but utterly unconstituional. The idea of censoring items from children based on offense is not something that should be pursued",4,4
3631,"Wouldn't it be nice to walk into a library and be able to find any sort of book possible? I believe that it would be very useful and helpful for many libraries to allow a varied censorship of books. In my opinion it would be beneficial to students, parents, or teachers to get information on different topics. As well as many students who need to write a paper about a certain topic that they @MONTH1 not be familier with, and allowing all the types of books would help anybody with any topic.      A library is a place where anyone can go to find information on something, find an interesting read, or just relax. If your going to get information on a topic that you know nothing about, it would be nice to find a book telling all about the topic. This would help students with reports, along with any other person who is trying to find some extra information they might not know about a topic.      If a person was to not want a certain type of books in the library, then I think that person should just try and ignore the books. I think this because I dont think books should be taken out that are beneficial to others, just because it is offensive to someone that could just ignore it.      Maybe the books are about drugs, sex, or violence, but they still are able to teach many people that aren't already knowledgable about the innappropriate, or offensive topics.      In conclusion, throwing books out and keeping a library censored, would be a mistake. It is a mistake because it is taking away from many people who are wanting to become knowledgable about different topics. It takes away from people who need to learn about topics for things such as school, or even work",3,3
3536,"Do I think offensive materials should be removed from libraries? No, I think that if a person is offended by it then they should not get it. They should ignore it and find something else of interest to them. If the person complains about a book, music,movies or anything then they  should not go to the library. I think if people get offended over a book or something like that and complain, they shouldn't be aloud in the library.     When I was in seventh grade we took a field trip to the city library. I thought it was fun because it looked awsome inside. I was walking around searching for a book about animals because all the seventh graders had to research an animal. When I was looking, I saw a guy yelling at one of the librarians. He was a guy of color and he was complaining because he read a book about slaves. He was offended by it cause his grandfather was a slave. I read the book and I thought there was nothing offeensive about it because it told about the slaves having to do hard work, then eventually they got free.        My opinion is that offensive materials should not be removed from libraries. People that do not think they are offensive will read them. If a person thinks that a book is offensive then they should just walk away and find a different book. That's why I think offensive materials should not be removed from libraries.",3,3
4142,Everyone has their favorite music they listen to or their favorite book to read even if it does offend a certain group or type of people. People do still read or listen to it. And the people who write the books or write the lyrics for a song are just expressing themselves. I believe that anything offfensive should'nt be censored because it's a way that people can express themselves.     I listen to music all the time as long a I like the way it sounds. It doesn't really matter to me what the lyrics say and im pretty sure that goes for alot of people. But there are some songs out there that people feel they can relate to so they actually listen to what the song is saying.     I don't really read alot because im picky about the books that I do read. That's not the case for everyone though. Alot of people like to read because it makes them feel like the book takes them to a different world. It's an escape for them from everyday life. Which I can understand why someone would want to escape.     Movies are like books but you get a visual of whats going on. Which makes it more entertaining than a book. So more people would rather watch a movie. But the movies don't have all the details that the book has so the books are more fulfilling. And just because someone doesn't like a movie doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who does because there is.     So my conclusion is that everyone is different they like different things and dislike different things. But just because someone doesn't like something doesnt mean that someone else wont like it. Like i said everyone is different. So why can't the materials they read or watch be different as well?,4,4
3630,"There are numerous books and movies which are deemed not appropriate for younger audiences. By marking movies with a rating, and marking books with a specific age group, it helps categorize them.      In our public libraries, all books and movies are settled into one place for everyone to have the ability to check out. There is the ongoing discussion on whether these should be available to everyone. If a child were to check out a book, and it happened to be rated @CAPS1, the parents would most likey become upset with the library for giving the right to the child to check out a rated @CAPS1 movie. There is also the instance where a parent would have the child check out a specific movie with a @CAPS1 rating. In which the library would be harrassed for not letting the child check it out. Furthurmore, should public libraries let certain age groups check out movies/books which are not appropriate? The logical answer concludes to no, they shouldn't. If a child can not see a rated @CAPS1 movie at the theatre, why should they be able to check them out freely at the library? Public libraries should invest in a way to keep underage kids from checking out inapropriate materials. By simply having their age on their library card, there would be a lot of misunderstandings taken care of.      Our public libraries should take it into their own hands, by changing their censorship. It would give them a better name, and give our children a secure place to gain access to these matirials.",3,3
4233,"All terms of offense are based on an opinion. If one person finds a particular word offensive, doesn't mean the next guy will feel the same way. Some parents aren't as strict on there kids as others, and some just dont care.      Of course there's always that gangster rap that talks about drugs and women being objectified that kids really dont need to belistening to. The horror movies that are rater ''@CAPS1' for a reason, they could have nightmare for weeks. Children's mental states aren't fully developed at a young age like ten. They still cant tell whats real and whats not. They need a trusted adult to rely on to tell them how to feel, to act, to do, even to think. Children just are't mature enough to handle a mojority of material in this world. No books should be taken away or hiddne fvrom society, it should just be given to you at your own disgression. Another possiblility would be have a group of many people gather and vote on age restrictions for particualr material. All information is helpful, just not all is necessary.     These days its hard to hide all harmful material from children, even some teenagers. This wolrd is becoming less and less sensitive everyday. Eventually everyone will be completly insensitive to all 'harmful' movies, books ,amgazines, @CAPS2 shows, and music. It wont even phase anyone anymore.",3,3
4227,"Why would you ever censor anything in a library? Apparently because things such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect. can be found offensive.  If something is considered offensive, why put it in a library anyway if its going to be open to anyone in the public, including children?       First off, censorship is important but we don't need it in libraries of all places.  Libraries is a place where all sorts of literature comes together in one place where it can be seen and read by those who admire literature.  Censorship is stopping this by pulling books off shelfs because they are considered offensive.  If a book is offensive, first decide what kind of audience it would be offensive to.  Then decide whether or not it is offensive to even an adult audience.  If it is found to be offensive to an adult audience, then it should be pulled off the shelves of a library.  Otherwise it should be placed in the adult section of the library.     Libraries should have certain sections for certain books and other pieces of literature.  As mentioned before, if a book is too offensive for anyone not of adult audience, it should be placed in an adult section.  Books that are suitable for children should be put in the children's section.  You can even have a such section for young adults for books that are suitable for teenagers.  Sections in a library almost completely defeats the need of censorship.  Sections help correctly place books and other pieces of literature in a library so that onlt readers of certain suitable ages @MONTH1 read them.     In conclusion, sections in a library can be used instead of censorship.  If we were to censor what books were on the shelves in a library the eventually there will hardly any books for anybody.  Sections help keep books in a library, but keeps them in a place where the right audience can view them",4,4
2984,"How @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was taken off the shelves of your school or public library? I, along with many other students, @CAPS4 find this discouraging and distastrous, so I do not believe that censorship should affect books that are on the shelves. Otherwise, a demolished love of reading, crushed individuality, and separated population @MONTH1 be born.     Like the beloved @PERSON2 @PERSON2 series by @PERSON1, many books and series are being taken out of libraries' collections due to people in society finding them offensive. In this case, the world of witchcraft in which this story blooms is against some religious beliefs; therefore, some individuals within a religion campaign to have these books banned. Fortunately, none of the libraries I visit, with their eclectic collections, had banned this series, or I @CAPS4 not have the strong thirst for literature as I do now. All books have the potential to pull a student into the wonderful world of reading, like @PERSON2 did for me, so taking away books that are most likely to spark an interest or start a firework of creativity @CAPS4 not only affect this generation, but the futures of all.          If this censorhip was to be allowed, who is to say what all  could be censored? Who @CAPS4 be the final judge as to what books @CAPS4 be banned? It @CAPS4 all come down to power and who was willing enough to take it. This struggle to be on top has the possibility of seperating people apart like political parties. Disagreements could turn into debates, and those could turn into fights. It can be concluded that people are stubborn for their beliefs, and to have someone choose what everyone is allowed to believe @CAPS4  be wrong. For instance, it @CAPS4 be like an @CAPS1 forcing a @CAPS2 to not believe in @CAPS3; a vegetarian commanding that meat can no longer be eaten; a woman taking away men's voting rights. Censorship @CAPS4 lead to the disrespect of other's opinions, and disrespect is never a beneficial thing.     Each and every person has a different opinion on what is offensive or not, so to censor books @CAPS4 be to censor all individual mentality. Without each person's unique thoughts and beliefs, the world @CAPS4 become similiarly vapid and dull. Differences in beliefs is what adds variety to the population and what makes a person special; additionally, free thought is a right all people should have. If someone was to limit the mental, literary stimulants that are out in the world, the amount of creativity and individuality @CAPS4 decrease.     To conclude, censorship @CAPS4 be a disrespect to individuality, personal beliefs, and the overall joy of reading a good book. Just because one might not believe in what a story says, it does not mean that the piece of literature should be forbidden. No one is being forced to read the books that grace the hundreds of shelves in a library, so if someone is offended, simply do not read it. So how @CAPS4 you feel if your favorite book was gone from all libraries? Disrespected? That is how I @CAPS4 feel",5,5
3287,"Censorship in librarys could be useful so children and young people don't see what their parents don't want them to see. In the kids section, they have kid's books. In the adult section they have adult books. Those sections are there to keep children from reading or seeing things that @MONTH1 be what their parents don't want them seeing. But then again, a parent could bring their kids into those sections so they can find their books without leaving their child unattended.     Completely taking books out of the library because they are offensive is not a good thing. It takes away certain literature that people might like reading. But then it also makes those people that want it censored uptight. I am a big reader so I have been to librarys many times but I never actually saw any material that was so bad I thought it needed to be taken out. If there was though, they should just make an alternative section for books, music, movies, and magazines that some people think should be put there.      For example, some albums that contain offensive language or topics have '@CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3' stickers on them. It's simple enough to see these stickers so that you can put it in the alternative section of a library. People that like and want to listen to that can easily go to that section and pick it out. Books always have reviews, so people can tell if those are too @CAPS1 or not. The library staff could put those books in the alternative section. Movies always have ratings, so staff could put anything rated @CAPS4 or above on those shelves. Now I've never seen a bad magazine at a library before. I'm sure they would never have magazines such as '@CAPS5' or '@ORGANIZATION1' there. People wouldn't need to worry about magazines from my experience.      That is my solution. Make an alternative section for all the offensive material in the library instead of taking it out completely. That takes away a lot of literature for the people that like that material. You couldn't take away movie classics like '@CAPS6' or '@CAPS7'. Those movies have been put on the highest of best film lists. Yes, they are rated @CAPS4 but no, that doesn't take away the fact that they are great movies. Don't take the material out. Just make a new section for it.",3,3
4280,"Books? Movies? Music? Magazines? We all like to read them, watch them, and listen to them. @CAPS2's hard to stop all that. Plus, @CAPS2's impossible to stop. Everywhere you go you can find these items. Such as the movie store, the mall, a gas station, a yard sale, and even your public library. People of all ages can go anywhere and get a book, movie, a @CAPS1, or a magazine and @CAPS2's perfectly fine. But, there is one problem. Censorship.     Yes that's what i said, 'censorship.' @CAPS2 means alot to some parents when @CAPS2 comes to their children. Espescially when @CAPS2 comes to the public library where they live. If a parent wants to take their kids to the library and get some books or movies or ect. that's okay but if a parent has to worry about a movie or magazine has 'bad things' in @CAPS2 that children shouldn't see is a problem. They want to be able to enjoy the movie or @CAPS1 or magazine with their children but bad things like nudity, violence, racial pictures, or profanity can be really offensive to parents AND people alone, just not parents. A lot of these examples can be offensive to anyone or everyone and censorship is a pretty good idea. There is no way if I was a parent that I would want my kids to look at or watch or read any 'bad things' because we all know that is not right. Kids are young and don't need to be learning about that stuff at a young age.      I think censoring is a really great idea and I think Libraries and other places that have books, movies, music, magazines, ect. should censorize there things. But if they wont censorize anything they should at least put them in catagories such as 'adults' or 'young adults' or 'kids'. If they catagorize the ratings then the parents and you know where to look for and don't have to worry about censorship. Censorship should be practiced everywhere.",3,3
3010,"Many people believe that magazines, books, movies, music, posters, plus some other kind of bad stuff that parents don't want there @CAPS1 to see. Some of the stuff they might have in the are books about different colored people, maybe there might also have some terrible things about that colored skin hairitage, @CAPS1 that are to young to be looking at stuff that is in these books. A lot of the @CAPS2 Libraries have these things speard around all over the store.     Some of these people that get these books might need to have a good heart about what the book is saying about the skin color. If they don't like what the book and what it has to say then don't get that book. Because you can't change the way the author wrote the story, music, movie, poster. But most the people that I know that are different colored are pretty hilarious and sometimes make jokes about it.      Maybe there might also be some pretty terrible things said in the book",3,2
3973,"Would you remove a book from a shelf just because it offends you? If you said yes, how is that any different than a white boy saying i can't learn with this black girl in class with me? Or if two people with different religions yould say he or she offends me because we dont believe in the same god.     Just because someone is offended by book or wrighting does not mean it should by removed form the shelf. In fact if they dont like it they dont have to read or even look at it. That is one freedom we have in america is to read anything we would like to. For someone to take anything off of a shelf that is open to the public is taking away their freedom.          In conclusion it is not okay for anything to be takin off of a public shelf no matter who in offends. It is a right we have as american's to read or wright anything we would like to, And removing offencive meteral would be taking away our freedom",3,3
3528,"Do you think having inappropriate or offensive books, magazines, movies or music should be found in a public library? Some books could be very offensive to people and when they take their children or younger siblings to the library, they don't want them looking at that. Others prefer looking at it which would anger them if they were taken away. Not all parents find some of the things in libraries offensive, even if they @MONTH1 be. Having music, magazines, movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it.      Even though having children look at something they shouldn't could be bad, it's also bad and unfair to those who only come to the library to view those things. It shouldn't be taken away from them.  If parents don't want their children seeing those things, the shouldn't take them to that section. Some adults don't enjoy seeing it, which can be understandable. No matter what, someone wouldn't be very happy about the decision.      In libraries, there is usually an adult section and kids section. If an adult doesn't want their child seeing something, they could simply take them to children's section where it won't be seen. In the children's section it's hard to find things that would be considered 'offensive' to adults. For the adults or teenagers who enjoy viewing these things, they could be in a section far away from the children. Taking things that people like away from someone is wrong and it would be mean to take that away from those who enjoy it.      Recently, the world has been turning into something it shouldn't. Some of the most disgusting and cruel things happen every day and you could probably find this news in a library. It's understandable if you wouldn't want your child around that, but I it's wrong to take away those things from the people that love that stuff. For example, scary movies could be very disturbing and too violent for a young child but they could be an adults favorite thing to watch. Thats why, if you put the more offensive things in a different section, the kids wouldn't notice it was even there.      If children were put into a different section, they wouldn't even notice the offensive things adults find. Taking away the things some adults @MONTH1 find offensive is like taking away the children's section, unfair. It wouldn't be fair to take away something that some adults or teenagers only come to the library for. Not all adults would understand both sides but I can see where both sides are coming from. If I had children I wouldn't want them seeinig things that are offensive, but I would keep them away from it instead of promoting against it. Having music, magazines movies or books that aren't appropriate for children should just be put into a different section, not taken away from those who enjoy it",4,4
3976,"Censorship?     Have you ever been looking for a book and not being able to find it? Have you ever gone to a library and the magazine you were looking for was behind everything else on the top shelf? Well if you have, you have experienced censorship. Censorship is where things are sheltered from the the light of day. A specific place of censorship is with books and magazines at libraries.     Most people today are worried about offensive things on and in books or magazines. A big question I ask is why? Well I can tell you why. Most people of today are too afraid of what other people think. Everything and everyone has to be perfect. I strongly disagree with this because if someone writes a book, they should not be afraid to put something in it because of what other people have to think about it. If they do not like it, then do not read it.     I do not think that things should be sheltered from libraries because sometimes it can get a point across to some people. If there is a article up on a shelf and it has an appealing image on it, you are going to stop and read it . If it has a good message to send to you will think about it. Then once you have thought about it, you will make your own opinion on what that article said. If you have a positive opinion you might go pick that magazine up and read it. If you have a negative opinion on what it said then you will not even look at the next time you go by there.     If you think that something is too bad for eyes of other people then so be it. That is your opinion and you have all of the right to it. I will not dislike you for your opinion and I will not look at you any differently. The only thing I hope is that I got my point across to you.",4,4
3771,"Libaries everywhere might have a book or two that @MONTH1 be offensive to a reader. I haven't found a book offensive to my readings just yet. Some people might think that some music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of the library. But some people are against it, like me. Its going to take more than one person to remove the music, magazines,etc., from the library.     Music in the library is good because you can't find old music like in the @DATE1's in a music store. If someone finds music offensive in the libary it might be because they don't know the history from where the music came from or what the artist has been through. Say for instance the person is offended by hip hop music. I'm sure there's a book for that and the person can look up where the music came from. Maybe then they wouldn't be so offeneded.     Magaizines in the library are really for people who love the media. There are so many magaizines that have interesting facts about what happen or what's going to happen. For example @ORGANIZATION1 has all the newest event or something big that happend, just in that one @ORGANIZATION1. Then there's advertisments, how would people get money if they didn't put there adverstisment in a @ORGANIZATION1 so people could buy there product. If not nobody would buy the products.     Movies in the library are for teachers to show students. Half the stuff in the libary, you can find at blockbuster or walmart. It's because the library has old movies and current events that happened years ago. They might even have a movie to go with the book the reader has read, but some people are more visual with the movie. So they read books.     Overall I hope the music, magazines, and movies stay on the shelves of the libraries and don't change they way the library is doing things. Some books might already be off the shelves that people have complained about or got offeneded by already. So its already too late for that. But its going to take more than one person to be aganist it. So that's my view on taking out music, magazines, and movies out of the library",4,4
3996,"Empty @CAPS1     @CAPS2 is it wrong to censor? In the world there are today there is about @NUM1 billion people. All these people make up diffrent groups with diffrent moral codes, ethics, beliefs, and out looks on the world. With this in mind, there comes a problem with what is wrong and right. The three subject that will be discused in this article will be censorship, expression, and society.     To be censored puts a lable on things that says this article is not fit to be seen, or heard by anyone. Censorship was made to protect people from raw material that is seen as unfit or cruel. Music is censored for the subject or matter it speaks about, wether it would be of sex, drugs, or poltics. This goes for movies, magazines, newspapers, televison, or other forms of media. the reasons that somethig is censored changes from place to place.     Expression of ones inner thoughts of the world or a genral area could be desaterous in the eyes of some. To others, expression gives the chance to see who could be the next @CAPS3 vinci, @PERSON1, or anyother great thinker of the world. Censoring these people can and would be horrible. The idea that just beacuase someone has a diffrent out look does not mean they are the evil that is in the world. True their work could cause a problem, but their idea should not be shuned by the world. The material they produce should be aloud to be seen by anyone of any age.     Society possess a big problem. Society or how one should act in public is diffrent all over the world. So therfore what is censored here would not be censored somewhere else. This also mean what is wrong or right is diffrent to everyone on earth. The society will have great effect on with is aloud to be seen or heard by those that live in the society. if the society disagrees with the ideas of something the society will have it banned. If this is let to continue nothing will be aloud to speak its mind on anything.     So @CAPS2 is censorship wrong? Censorship is unjust to those with ideas unlike others. If someone can censor someone else then that person that is being censored could in turn censor the person that is censoring them because of that persons veiws. So yes it is wrong to censor anything or anyone for thier ideas, morals, ethics, rules, laws, beliefs, or conduct. Everything should be aloud to exsist and be seen or heard by anyone who wants to look into that subject of matter. In conclusion censorship, expression, and society will always have veiws but none of these view should ever be hiddin from anything or anyone.",4,4
2985,"Do you think that you should be able to take certian materials off a shelf of a library, because someone finds it offensive? Here are some of the examples that I can think of just off of the top of my head. Books, movies, music, magazines, or even computer excess. So if you wouldn't mind sit back get relacked in a good comfortable spot, because here we go.      So have you desided what you think about taking them off the self of your local libary or even your school library. We I have came up with what I think about it. In some way yes, but in other ways no. For an example I bet there are old books in my school library right know that haven't even been picked up for a long time, just because they are old and overly out dated.     The reason I say they shouldn't be pulled off the shelf of a library. Well just becasue some people seems that it's offensive, doesn't mean it couldn't almost the most popular book in the hole library. The person that likes that book might find that the poeple that found the book offensive, they book might be offending the other person. So if you think about it, you will  always have the poeple that like to complain about something no where you go.      I just put an example out there of what I have seen. I was at a library one time and there way these to guys. One was complaining how the farm books never get messed with. Then the other guy walked up with two of the books that was over there in the farm section of that library. So the librarian is just taking in all the information that the two guys was disabuting during that time. During all of this I was just about five feet form the counter these guys was at. So then the guy that was talk about how the farm books should get pulled off the shelf he ask the librarian where the books was on spaceships. Then the guy that was getting the farm books said you really should take them off the shelf because he hasn't seen anyone over that way for years.     So that is just to tell you that if you was to take a book, some music, or any other of the thinks that you can find in a library should just more in likely stay where they are, because the library got them books or any of that other stuff for a reason. That reason is, because you don't ever know what someone might just come walking through that door just looking for that lonely book, magizne, movie, or just need to get on the computer.     Well know that you probably getting tired of hearing the reasons why I think no books or any other things should get pulled off the shelf. Now it's time to tells you why they should get pulled off the shelf of that local library in your neiborhood.     The main reason somethings should get pulled off the shelf of the local library or school library is if the book was really damaged. For an example I have been to one of the libraries in my county and they had a book in there that the back cover of the book was torn completly off. That is bad that they would have that on there shelf, just because that makes there library looks like a trashed up place to go to.     Another reason why something should get pulled off the shelf is if the book supported drugs. Like if there was a books about some that was doing drug and they got cought with them and they just got a 'slap on the wrist' as I call it. A slap on the wrist is when you get in trouble for something and you don't even get in any trouble you just get handed over to your parents. That is what I think the saying 'just a slap on the wrist' means.      So all in all more in likely the book should probably just stay on the shelf. Like I said earlier in this essay, you will always have you people that like to complain about every little pitty thing they can find to complain about. Which I mostly learned that from the state tractor pulling club. So I hope that I haven't taken to much of your time up. So just think next time you are at a library and you see a book and you think man that book needed to be taken off the shelfs, just refer back to this essay",2,3
4694,"Do you think that certain materials should be removed off library's bookselfs if someone dislikes or does not agree with the topic or the plot? Do you believe that a book should be banned from any public library just because someone has a negative opinion about what the book is convincing readers?     I believe that every person has the choice to not read a book or magazine, or even watch a movie, if they find it offensive.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the self. But if I have the right to remove that book from the self- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no book left on the self for any of us.' @CAPS1 quote from the arthur, Katherine Paterson, from my opinion, I believe that what she is saying is very true. Considering that everyone has a different opinion on many things, if everyone had a right to remove one book that they did not like or felt it was offensive from the self, there would not be a varity of books for people to choose from. I have sometimes gotten corious about what a friend was reading and asked them if they thought it was a good book. They either tell me it is a good novel or tell me it was horrible. Then I would read a few pages and I would think it was pretty good. So if they had the right to remove that book I would have never got the chance to read that book.     I do not believe that people should be able to remove books from shelfs just on their specific personality. Everyone has a different opinion or perspective about books. Everyone should get a large variety",4,3
3888,"Should offenive material be censored? No, censoring books, music, movies, magazines, etc. takes away from our freedom as an american citizen.  If you think books should be censored, then think about this.  Would they take 'hell' or 'damned' out of the bible because those words are considered offensive?  I do not think so, those words give power to the book.  @CAPS1 books, considered offensive, are an insigh to history and culture.  Taking away these books will limit education.  Books should not be censored.         I very resent and much talked about case of censorship is the popular book '@ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1.'  The book tells the story of a young white boy running off with an older black man.  In the story, the word 'nigger' is used frequently.  A lot of people were offended by the using of this word, so they republished a new version of the book, replacing 'nigger' with 'slave.'  @CAPS1 people were happy with the word change, but others felt that by censoring the word they were taking away a very vital part of the story.  I agree with the latter statement.  The story's setting was back when black people were slaves and known as niggers.  I agree that the word nigger carries a heavy connotaion, but that is the purpose of using the word.  The author used it so that the reader could get a feel for what life was like back then.  When thinking about the coming generations, who will not know about slavery or black oppression, the book gives a raw insight into how life was for a black man. The word itself is a symbolism of slavery, without it, the book is not as powerful.       Censorship is a fine line, and everybody has a different place where they draw that line. The story of @ORGANIZATION1 is just one example of censorship.  On television, nudity and language is censored when dubbed inappropriate.  It should be up to the parent to decide which books there child should read, which magazines they should buy, and which television programs they should watch.  If the parent sees the book as offensive or think that there child should not read it, then they should be the ones who makes sure their child does not read it.  The books should not be taken of the shelf because they will entertain and educate other children or parents.  Books should not be censored, if a person does not think the book is appropriate, then they do not have to read it.",5,4
4010,"The library is an important place for the knowledge seeker.  The library holds books of past and current writers.  It also holds information on past and current events.  Censorship in libraries has become an ongoing debate.  Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offenseive history, books, or newspaper articles.     Censorship in libraries should not be allowed to avoid offensive history.  One reason to ban censorship in historical events is because it would create a loss of information.  Periods like the holocaust, the genocide of about six million @CAPS1 by @LOCATION2, would eventually die with the generations that knew about it.  The holocaust was an event that became known @CAPS2 wide during @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4 which was a major historical event.   The slave trade would be another historical event lost to censorship.  The slave trade is a major part in @CAPS5 history that helped shape the country it is today.  Another reason to ban censorship in historical events would be because of their importance.  If we censor certain materials we began to forget key parts of history.  Keeping those historical facts poses an opportunity to teach and learn.  Censorship in libraries aimed toward historical events should not be allowed.     Also, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.  One reason is beacuse authors wrote their books how they intended them to be read.  An example is @PERSON2.  The author of The @CAPS6 of @PERSON3 and The @CAPS6 of @ORGANIZATION2.  Both books use the word @NUM1r to convey the tone.  Another examample is the author of To @CAPS7 A @CAPS8, @PERSON1.  Another reason to ban censorship in books is because that's an authors writing style.  The author writes a book how they want it to be read.  Therefore they use the language and words of the time period they write about.  @PERSON2 didn't use @NUM1r because he was racist, he used it to convey what times were like and how people talked.  Censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to change books.     Finally, censorship in libraries shouldn't be allowed to get rid of newspaper articles.  One reason is because newspapers was the way to send out information.  It brought peoples attention to recent happenings.  It informed people of what was going on.  Getting rid of that is just another loss of information.  Newpapers were key players in getting out information about @LOCATION3, @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4, the assasination of @CAPS12 and @ORGANIZATION1.  Another reason to keep from censoring newpapers in libraries is because of their importance today.  They continue to keep people informed of recent and also past events.  An example is the death of @LOCATION1 and how he caused the deaths of many @CAPS13 on @DATE1 eleventh.  Articles about views on the death penalty.  Censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries to get rid of offensive newspaper articles.     The library is a homestead to the knowledge seeker.  There, they can read about past and current events.  They can also read classics by great authors.  Censorship should not be allowed in libraries to avoid offensive history, books, or newspaper articles.",4,4
4621,"Books, music and movies are all important, specially to kids. If we decide to take one book off of the shelf, then so will everyone else and the book shelf will be almost empty. The same idea for movies, magazines, music, ect. Even though, some parents do not accept it for their young children to read or watch uncensored materials from the library, it is the parents' role to supervise their children and choose for them and teach them what is right and what is wrong to read or watch.      Libraries usually require @CAPS1 cards. These @CAPS1 cards allow the person to have access to adults' materials depending on the kind of card the person has. Since it is the parents' decision to decide the materials their children have access to, they shouldn't blame anyone if their chilren have taken something they don't like off of the shelf. Libraries have done everything that needed to be done to have complete safety for the society.      If we try to remove every single book, movie, song, or magazine that contain an offensive thing, we would have to remove almost everything. People have different cultures and beliefs. They might think some things are offensive while other take it as a normal thing.      In the current society, a lot of people are more attratced to movies or music that contain some unappropriate materials because these materials have recently taken over in the media. We can't stop publishing them but we can censor them. There are different kinds of channels that view these materials. Internet, @ORGANIZATION1, and libraries can all be under parents' supervision. Thus, parents can not blame anyone other than themselves, if their children read or saw unacceptable materials.      Libraries should stay the way the are currently and keep their way of censorship without any change. Parents need to have full supervision to their children. Libraries enough restrictions and rules on their books and movies based on the persons age",4,4
4416,"Is @CAPS1 Right?     Is @CAPS1 right to have censorship in libraries? This question could be answered in two very different opinions. Some people @MONTH1 want all censorship items out of public areas. On the other hand, there are people that @MONTH1 like to read this type of material. This is a very opinionated topic.     In my opinion, libraries are places I go to find a book to read, research, listen to music, rent movies, or relax while looking at a magazine. Libraries are puble areas and not everyone is going to agree. Everyone has their own favorite book or genre. I believe @CAPS1 is unjustiful to take away censorship in libraries because this @MONTH1 be ones favorite genre. Why do libraries need to limit their choice while noone else does? For example, many parents would love if all clothes stores would ban holes in jeans because they are to revealing. The stores don't. They do not ban holes in jeans because many teenage girls like holes in their jeans. American @CAPS2 is not going to band capris just because I do not like them. There are different favorites, likes, dislikes, and opinions.     A great resolution for this dissagreement is catorigizing. By putting all of the censorshiped books, movies, magazines, and music in one area, @CAPS1 will decrease arguments on this topic because all of the people that like censorship in libraries will be together in their area. Where as the people that do not want the censorship in libraries do not have to be around @CAPS1. This is a quick and easy fix.      There is no reason to take away ones favorite genre because someone doesn't like @CAPS1. If this is true then our world will have nothing because not everyone likes one certain thing. For instance, I do not like blue aeropostale shirts. Pink are my favorite. My friend @CAPS3 likes the blue shirts and hates the pink shirts. We both write to the manager to get rid of the shirt color we do not like. This is nonbenifical for either of us because now the one we do not like is got but so is the one we do like. This is nonsense. There will be nothing left in the store. Pople in charge can easily sort material at a store or a library to make @CAPS1 fit the communities likings. Getting rid of material is not the answer. Catorigizing is the fix that needs to be put into action immediatly",3,3
3660,"I think that certain materails should not be removed because a couple people do not like what is in a book, or movie, or in music. If we where to listin to what everyone said and remove the books that they do not like then other people would not have anything to read. For example if a man came in a library and asked the library to remove a book that is about murdering and has violence in it. A person that @MONTH1 come in the library daily @MONTH1 want to read that book because that is the type of books that the man likes.     Another example is if a person has children that come into the library and there children were watching movies about gangs,drugs,and violence, the mother would want that movie removed from the library. I say that if the mother does not want her children to watch the movies they do she should say something to them and punish them every time they are cought watching it. Instead of parents trying to remove the books that many other people like they should be more disciplined with there children.A way for the library to stop children from geting movies or books they should not be reading is to put all the books and movies in a special area where it will be watched. Many people like movies with drugs, and violence. There type of movies or books should not be removed because of what another person thinks about that certian thing.     I also think that if a person does not like the type of language or images in a book or movie then they should not read it or watch it. And if they say there children watch it or read it without there permission then that is there fault and they should know more about what there young children are doing instead of trying to get that book, movie removed sometimes books and movies have very offensive languge but that is because they are just trying to show some of the stuff that happens in the real world. They want the movie or book to be as real as posssible.",3,3
3130,"offensive materials in libraries should not be taken off of the shelves because of their content. Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could obscure their message. people live around offensivness every day on the street and in public places so censoring it in libraries would not protect anyone. Removing the books from libraries entirely could also interfere with research or school projects children have to work on for class.     Writing is an art form and censoring what an author writes could potentially obscure a message or major theme of the novel. This style of writing can be seen in @PERSON1's novel To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 by @PERSON1 using terms that are offensive to @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to set the one of the racial tension in the south at that period in time. This type of censorship would also be detrimental if a reader studying the holocaust can not view pictures of death camps because of the graphic nature, the reader would not be able to understand the true horror of the camp without it.     People live around offensivness every day at home, on the streets, and even in school. A normal person encounters several occasions a day where they @MONTH1 hear profanities on the street from passing strangers or friends. Parents sometimes curse or use profanties in front of their children to prove a point or just by accident, and this would expose children to offensive behavior just as much as adults. Children are also exposed to profain language and behavior when they go to school and work around ither childern who might have offensive behaviors.      Censorship of books in libraries could interfere with school or work related projects and research. Censorship could be an issue if a student could not get a book on a major war or event because of graphic nature, and this would hinder the students ability to efficiently complete their assignment. It could also cause problems if a teacher needs to rents a book that has slight profanity in it but is not able to because of the content, inhibiting her from teaching her students about the theme and lesson.     Censorship of books based on the content should not be allowed in libraries. first of all trying to censor a novel might abscure the message or theme. secondly people live around profanity every day so trying to censor it would not protect people because they have likely already heard what is said in the novel. lastly censorship of libraries could interfere with work or school projects or research. If all libraries were censored it could potentially lead to several complications with workers, students, or people who are just looking for a good book to read",4,3
4384,"I do not believe that materiales in libraries should be censored. If parents don't want their children reading or listening to inappropriate things, they should pay more attention to what they are doing. If parents monitor their children closer they will be able to control what they are doing. There are alot of bad things for children to read, look at, and listen too out there. Parents need to do a better job teaching their children about what they can and should look at, read, or listen too.     It isn't often when you go to the library that you find something inappropriate unless you are looking for something inappropriate. It is very easy to tell what is good and what is bad. Most of the time in a library the more profound books and magazines are seperated from the childrens books. This, to me, is the way it should be in all libraries. In all of the times i have been to a library i have never accedentally come across something inappropriate. A library is a place for people of all ages it should not be limited to just one age group.     If libraries were censored more people would be upset. It would be the same way if a store stopped selling your favorite product because one person did not like it. Alot of adults probably would not go if the library were censored. The library would then become a place for mostly children. Most small children do not even go to the library so they would become virtually useless.     In all of my years I have never once heard of someone being deeply offended by something at a library. Weather it be in a magazine, on the news, or by word of mouf, I have never seen a complaint. Most parents do a good job of monitering what the children look at or read. Those parents should not be deprived of their privelages to look at more adult rated things if they choose. Just because one parent was to irresponsible to moniter their child does not mean that all of the parents should be punished.     The library is a place for people of all ages. Therefor the library should keep material for people of all ages and not just for children. The bottomline is that if people do not want their kids looking at inappropriate things they should keep a better watch over them. They should also teach them the difference in what is acceptable and what is not acceptable.",4,4
3793,"A colossal number of significant and life-changing books can be found in the millions of libraries throughout the world. The big question is whether or not individuals should get rid of the books of lesser importance, and the books that are found offensive to a number of people. In my opinion, there are a certain number of books wasting away on the shelves of the library that need to be disposed of. That is why libraries need to discover which books are creating issues, such as books on race or religion. Although Katherine Paterson boldly argues against taking books off of the shelves, I strongly disagree and believe that libraries should remove materials that are creating tension or books wasting away on the shelves.     Race is an extremely important topic in the world today, and I believe books that discrimate against certain ethnicity's need to be removed immediately from libraries. @CAPS2, there are exceptions to this proposal. For instance, books talking about the civil war and underground railroad need to be kept in libraries because they are significant historical events. Unlike fantastic books about our nation's history, there are also books about race that are of lesser importance, and they @MONTH1 offend people. In that case, libraries need to crack down on this issue and remove offensive books from the shelves!     Secondly, libraries need to be extremely cautious about what music is made available to the public. It is important that we teach our children the difference between right and wrong at a young age, and if the kids hear some of the derogatory music on the shelves, they will lose all sense of what is right and wrong. As Katherine Paterson mentions in her quote,' All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' @CAPS1, that same quote can easily apply to the music on display in the libraries.  By libraries exposing children to derogatory music, they are creating enormous liabilities for the children and their families. Overall, our society would benefit greatly if libraries removed derogatory and offensive music.     Lastly, Katherine Paterson says that if we keep removing offensive books from the shelves, there will be 'no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2, that is a nieve comment as @CAPS1 as an exaggeration. There are millions of libraries throughout the world and thousands of items in each of those libraries. Therefore, it would benefit our society if we would dispose of the items creating the greatest amount of tension, and there is one simple but effective way of doing that. When people are at the check out desk at the library, the library could have a sheet of paper asking if the customer found a certain book offensive. If the same item appears regularly on the list, remove the item. That would benefit everybody greatly because the offensive items would no longer be on the shelves, and it takes little effort from all parties involved.     In conclusion, I oppose Katherine Paterson's decision and believe libraries should remove offensive materials immediately. One highly controversial topic is race, and if the book is not informing us about a historical event, it should be removed. Certain derogatory and offensive music is available in libraries, and it should be removed from the shelves as @CAPS1. A quick and efficient way of figuring out which books are offensive is to have a list available to the public where they can write down which book they find offensive. Ultimately, libraries need to take action and dispose of the offensive materials that pose a threat to our society",5,5
3596,"Should They or Should They @CAPS1?     What do you think? Music, books, movies and many others have been questioned either about there apperence or what they say. Most people bring up the fact that young children should @CAPS1 be hearing this or haveing to read about it at such a young age, but the children have ideas of their own. In my personal opinion i do @CAPS1 think that they should have to be taken off the shelf or from being sold. What does everyone else think though? Is it a bad idea to keep them up and let the kids learn about it at such a young age or does it help teach them @CAPS1 to be like that?     One of the main reasons why I think it should be left alone as is so that the children can read it. They must learn the good from the bad sometime. Its better that children learn at a young age and just trying to keep things from them will make them want it more. Lets use music for example, some music is nothing but screaming and cursing. In real life though alot of kids have to listen to there parents fight and yell. So, why dont they get the choice to listen to it whenever they want to?     There are also the bad things to keeping them out on the shelvs. As a mother and also a teenager I feel like as if  I should have the choice to do as I please but at the same time there is no way I would ever let my daughter hear or read some of the things I do. That get me to my next point. If you really have a problem with some of the things out there why would you let your childern get it. As being a teegager I would go out and buy a lot of music I shouldnt be listening to, but even if my daughter was @NUM1 there is no way I would let her get it. After all I am the parent right? I have every say in what my daughter can and can't do. So do you over your own child. If other parents have no say in what there child gets just because they don't care, well thats @CAPS1 your problem.      There should,however, be age limits on what some are allowed to get parent permission or @CAPS1. Books with sex scenes and murder should @CAPS1 be allowed into they @NUM2 year old books. Sure, teenagers think they know it all but they still shouldnt be allowed to read something that adults do. Most @NUM1 year olds don't hear about all the drugs, sex, or teen prganacy. As much as they should get information on it, have there parents pick out what book they should read to find out about that kind of thing. I think that in every library that has sexual books and alot of curse words should be put in a specific location that only adults can get to. Video games have to put an age limit on things so why shouldn't books have to have the same exact thing? The only reason they have'nt done anything so far is beacuse @CAPS1 enought parents care.This is your chance to get up and show them that you want to make a change, that you won't let your kids hear about things without your knowing.     This brings me to my conclusion. Where are the parents out there? Why arn't you stepping in and showing people the right way to live? Make your nearest library have age limits on what the little young ones can read. See if the books you are letting your son/daughter check out are age worthy or @CAPS1. Last but @CAPS1 least try to talk your libraien into makeing groups of books. Some for the youngre kids some for the older. Woulnt kill for you to put your say in and try to get this kind of thing under control and @CAPS1 just removed. Why remove other people's interests when you can just put an age limit on it and @CAPS1 let your child get a hold of it. Today is the day!!Make a say!!",4,4
3753,"In libraries there are a bunch of books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. to let the general public check out. This topic about censorship in libraries is a diffitcult one because everyone has different views on things in life. Certain materials in libraries should not be remove from the shevles if they are found offensive by someone.           Being in a library there are lots of choices to see and check out. In a library, someone comes arcoss a book or a movie that seems offensive to them. That someone should just look at the other way because a library is for the general public. It seems to be harse about this, but it is not up to that person if the material in the library should or should not be in that library. The materials that are offensive to people could be in a special place in the library to comitdate everyone.      Libraries have the right to censor any type of material that seems or is offensive to the community. This is right if the community strongly agrees with their local libraries. If the whole community disagree with a library about a certain material then the community have a say in it.      Yes, there are books out in libraries that are offensive to a group of people, but that does not mean take that material out of the library. Our country, @LOCATION1, say that everyone has the right to free speech. @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 has banned books thats are offensive to @CAPS1, but other countries around the @LOCATION2 might have those books in their libraries.      There is a thick line if a certain type of material in a library is offensive or not. Someone should not have the right if a  book seems offensive to that person, but if the whole community says that the book is offensive then yes.      The libraries and the community have choices to not have a offensive book on the self. If it is offensive to everyone then it should be off the shelf. Censorship is a diffitcult topic to agured on",3,4
4355,"The common phrase 'knowledge is power' accurately paints the situation at hand. Through censorship in libraries, which are meant to allow free access to all media-related materials, we take away the opportunity for people to empower themselves through knowledge. The reasons for not censoring media in libraries are numerous and include, but are not limited to, unconstitutionality of censorship, the lack of proper definition for 'offensive', and the contradiction censorship poses to the core of what a library is.      The first, and most blatant, reason for not allowing the censorship of materials in libraries is the unconstitutionality of the matter. Freedom of speech and freedom of press are both protected by the constitution upon which our country was founded. Censorship of said materials will effectively undermine both of these rights. Authors, illustrators, journalists and the slew of other individuals who compose the materials available in libraries are exercising their right to free speech through their works. They are constitutionally protected in the things they say. Notice that @CAPS1 have a right to free speech and not a right to free speech so long as no one is offended. The freedom of press is the means by which they share their ideas and concepts with the world. They are utilizing their free speech by means of press. Censoring library materials would be limiting the means by which artists can share their ideas with citizens of the @LOCATION1. This would be a clear failure to uphold the rights of the citizens. For this reason, we cannot censor libraries.      The constitutional concept of equality of man plays into the situation as well. There is no adequate legal definition of 'offend'. People could be offended by something as serious as a personal attack on their beliefs and personal entity or something as light as a personal distaste for certain mindsets and ideas. So, because all men are equal, we would have to respect the 'offense' taken by all people and to all degrees. This leaves every single work of art, whether it be a book, movie, magazine or any other form provided by libraries, open to the fickle definition of offensive and vulnerable to the personal feelings of every individual. If said offense taken by individuals to works is able to mark a work as 'offensive' and thus make it open to removal from libraries, we are effectively allowing citizens to undermine the rights of other citizens. This is something that cannot be allowed in our libraries.      The final core issue is the essence of censorship versus the essence of a library. Censorship is meant to create a politically correct and non-offensive environment through the limitation of exposure to materials. Libraries, however, are meant to allow public access to works that stretch and challenge knowledge, beliefs, notions and all ideas held by people through the works of others. Censorship cannot be implemented without a clash with the essence of a library's purpose. If censorship were to be enacted, a library could not provide new information if someone else did not like what was being taught. A library could not provide works that challenge and stretch individual beliefs if someone was offended by the means by which the stretching occurred. Pre-conceived notions could not be defeated with the presence of factual knowledge if someone did not like the truth. In all of these ways, and many more, a library's core ideals and purpose could not be upheld with the induction of a system of censorship.      All in all, we can see that censorship could only hope to destroy the system libraries abide by. The constitutional rights of citizens would be infringed upon, the fickle nature of humans and the lack of definition for 'offensive' would allow people to undermine the rights of others, and the essence of what a library really is would be ravaged. We cannot, as @CAPS1 with rights, employ a system of censorship",6,5
3957,"As an individual and what books I have read, I believe some books needs to be taken off the shelf. My concern is for the children who get a hold of these books. Kids should be kids and wait till they're older and more mature to know about certain things. This also includes music, movies, and magazines. Some people believe these things influence bad behavior like stealing, cussing, and even murder. The less obsene matterial we have the better we can control our kids or at least some of them anyway.         We see bad behavior every day like stealing, cussing, murder, and assault. Ever wonder what causes people to do it? Just look around you they show it in movies, they talk about it in books. theres even songs about it, no wonder kids think its okay to do these kind of things! If we limit these items we @MONTH1 see positive results.     Like I said before kids should be kids and be free of these obsene materials. They will be exposed to it sometime but hopefully when they're older. In the mean time censors should be put on these items or taken off the shelf.",2,2
3849,"Having offensive books and movies in a library shouldn't be allowed. If you were in a library and you saw a book or anything that you took offensive, more than likely someone else will find it offensive too. So, by eliminating the problem before anyone else sees it, will reduce problems before they even happen. Now, more then ever, you will find offensive things in libraries. More people get offended by lesser things now.         One reason to have a censorship in libraries is that, if you had a child, would you want them going to the library and seeing derrogitory writings and movies? I would be very upset if my child had to see that. It's teaching them different values and it's teaching them that since it's in a library it must be okay to do out in the community. For example, if the library has a book or movie about doing drugs or anything sexual, they're going to look up to that and more then likely do those things, which they could end up harming themselves or others.     If the goverment provides the taxes for the libraries, doesn't it show that our goverment doesn't care about the offensive items on the shelves? It gives them a bad name. If we look to our goverment for support and answers. How would we feel if they had no judgement about the offensive things in libraries? It would seem like they didn't care and that might cause panic throughout the country.Which would cause many more problems then needed. It would be a easier thing just to censor our libraries.     If our libraries weren't consumed with negative and offensive literature, we would have a lot more room for things of greater value. We could have books and movies that are educational and will actually teach a person something. Rather than, lead them into making bad decisions. There are plenty of other sites and places you could get a book if you really wanted it. Not just the library has books. You could find one quite easily if you tried. If a library does have offensive things,  I think they wouldn't have a large variety, so it would be a better decision just to look for it elsewhere, where you could find a larger quantity of the subject you are looking for.     When I go to the library, I go there for educational books, not books that teach kids how to 'fill a bong' or 'different sex postitions.' I highly disagree and I think it's a negative outlook on our society by putting those things in our future generation's hands to read. So by putting censorship in our libraries, not only will calm down some of the problems that are re-occuring in our communities, it just might eliminate the problem completely.",4,4
4075,"Did your child ever bring home a book? A piece of music, movie or magazine? Did you ever stop to think that the piece of information that your child was bringing home could be offensive to someone else?     There are points in time where there isn't an answer to that question and you dont want to chose yes or no. The driving question is do you want to remove books, music, movies and magazines from the shelf, just because a parent thinks that its not fit for a child to be reading. Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shel. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, that I work abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 point in this quotation is that if you take a book off the shelf everytime that someone doesnt think that its right for children to see, then there will be no books left to see.      In agreement to Katherine, parents @MONTH1 want the best for their children, but there are reasons to why you should agree with the average parent and then there are reasons to why you shouldn't. There are books out amongst the world that only adults should see, and their are also books out there that are way too advance to be read by children. These books are all made for a reason and have there own purpose on why they are put there. Parents have to sit back and think of their children and then think of the rest of the world, its a big world and you cant just take things away from it. No matter how much you want to protect a child from the point of seeing the books that are meant for older age ranges, there isnt a way that you can stop it.      I think that books are there for whatever reason they were written for. There is no reason that because one person doesn't agree with the way that someone has written that book, it should be taken off the shelf just for that child. Libraries cant just start taking books off the shelf for individual mothers that dont like this or dont like that. Many people come from many different areas and see things in a different perspective, they dont know the difference between right and wrong.      It's a bigger world out there than you and me. When one person tries to stand against the world, they're going to get knocked down. So why fight when the world was meant to be at peace?",3,3
3212,"Censorship. It's a word that everyone has heard, but do people truly know what it means or how it effects them? In the past, books have been censured by rulers and leaders who thought that the material was harmful. How could they say that they knew what was best for their people? What gave them the right to decide what their people could or could not read? In today's society, we still have to deal with censorship issues. There are still people who believe that libraries need to censor their books. Censorship is wrong. Books, magazines, movies, music, etc. should not be removed from the shelves just because certain people find them offensive. Everyone has different tastes, not only in food, but in every other part of their lives as well. No one person has the right to say that one genre is better than another. Censorship is wrong because it limits what people can read, watch, and listen to.     Censorship should not be allowed because it limits what people can read.  Some people like mysteries, while others like to read romantic books.  If we allow people to censor what we read, then how can we say that their is a book for everyone to like? If libraries censored every book that might offend someone else, then there would not be any books left for anyone to read. For example, certain religious books might offend people of other religions, but that does not mean that we should take them off the shelves. If we did that, we would have to take away all religious books so that no one was offended. Then no one would be able to find books about their religion, and no one would benefit.     Similarly, censorship limits what people can watch. If we removed every movie that had even one tiny part that offended someone else, there would be no more movies left in the world. Every movie is going to have something that someone will love and someone will hate. If we only focus on the person who hates it and get rid of movies based on the people who hate them, then the people who love the movies will suffer for it.  People who love horror movies probably hate comedies.  This does not mean that we need to get rid of comedies just because that there are some people who dislike them. It only means that the people who don't like that type of movie don't have to watch them.     In the exact same way, censorship keeps people from enjoying the type of music that they love.  We can't censor music because everyone has different types and genres that they like. If we take away one kind of music, then we have to take away every kind of music.  It is not fair to say that we can censor one genre of music because some people dislike it or find it offensive when there are people who truly enjoy listening to that type of music. It would be unfair to those people, and if we are unfair to them, we have to be unfair to everybody. People would be even more offended than before in that case.     There will always be unhappy people in the world.  We should not result to censoring books, movies, and music in libraries and other places just to try make people happy.  Censorship in libraries limits what people can enjoy.  It makes the the people who would like the items that have been censored mad.  We should not result to that. We should allow people to pick what they like.  If a person want to read something they should be allowed.  If they want to watch a certain movie or listen to a certain song, then why not let them?  The slim margin of people who dislike what those people enjoy can just avoid reading, watching, or listening to it. We can't take something away from the people who love it just because someone is unhappy.",4,4

This is not really happening at the @ORGANIZATION1 I think.)     To the people at the @ORGANIZATION3 I would like to tell you and your readers that there is something wrong with the @ORGANIZATION2. Nothing really all  to serious I guess. . It seems the libaraiains there are censoring  tons of books and other materials. One of which I really need for a homework assignment on the movie @CAPS1.      They say that they are censoring what I need for the assignment because it is to bloody and scary for some of the other readers.  There have also been some complates from parents as well, saying that their kids had nightmares for weeks from the movie .     To that I said well can I still use the computers there to get information. They said that they have  already blocked all the inaproperate sites as well. I do not have internet at home so you can see how well that is going to go at school. So then I tryed to get the @CAPS2 to uncensor all of the stuff they have all ready have censored. So that way I could just make them censor all the werid adult rated things at the @ORGANIZATION2. That way no kid will have nightmares any more.I also threw in the idea of seperarting all the @CAPS3 and @CAPS4 by age group like child,teen, older teen. To this they said all right but they were going to keep the classic @CAPS4 and @CAPS3     The @CAPS2 said they @MONTH1 try my idea and see if it works But I would have to volunteer at the @ORGANIZATION2 and go through all the stuff that has been censored over the years. To this I said ok, but after I saw home big the censor list was it was like a nightmare over a hundered pages of book at least. I was to scared to see how long the other lists were. So seeing that it was to big for me to handle alone I got most of the other volunteers to help me. Then put up posters at the school I go to,to see if anyone else would be willing to help me.      So far there has not been much progress in the lists so I would like to ask that if there are any readers out there reading this article.

4721,"All materials in a library are for the public. This is why we have public libraries. Children are most likely with an adult when they go to a library and are normaly looking for books or activities that they would enjoy at their age. If a costomer in a library finds a book or item that they find offensive then it most likely was not an accident. Materials in libraries are for the public and should not be taken away just because a few find it offensive.     Children are very suspicious in libraries because they know that adult material is also in the library. This is where an adult comes in and supervises the child. Some parents don't mind that children see these images or read innapropriate information, but on the other hand some parents do. If someone comes across information that would be offensive they were most likely looking for it and are aware of where it is. Everyone in a library has the right to take or read what they want. There is no sign outside the door that says only certain ages of people can visit certain areas of the store.      It is the parent or gardians decision to allow or not alow their child to visit the more innapropriate areas of the store. Everyone has different rules and those rules are to be followed, but it is not the libraries job to keep track and watch those children to make sure they stay in their designated area.     There is a place for everything in a library and most of the locations are pretty obvious as to what kind of information is held there. For instance, more adult and innapropriate material is located in the back of the store. Adult matter is held back there to make it more private and harder for little children to discover and to be alittle more private to people who are reading it. Childrens' books and movies are usually loctaed in the front of the store so it draws their attention more. Children @MONTH1 never know what else is in the store if they dont go looking for it. Children should be acompanied by an adult if the adult believes their child would wander off looking for innapropriate materal.     Other material that could be offensive could not only be to children, it could be offensive to different races or cultures as well. Also if a person finds that information, they were most likely looking for it. Everything is labeled in a library and something doesn't just pop up out of nowhere if you where not looking for it.      Overall material in a store is public and for anyone who comes into the store. Children should be watched if they are suspicous and wander in the library. If someone does not want to find this informatin or think it would be offensive, then they should not go near the area which it is located",4,4
4544,"My opinion on this would be that , they are going to learn about @CAPS3 anyways so why take @CAPS3 off the shelfs ? No I don't think any adult material should be cencered . You know when your little girl or boy as about what they have in there hand , simple just take @CAPS3 from them and say '@CAPS1 your eyes can't handle .' @CAPS2 , they are going to ask questions and @CAPS2 , they will start to wonder , but they learn that stuff in school anyways so what's the big deal ?      If I had a child , who had got into my personal stuff and started asking questions , I would simply tell them '@CAPS3's a mommy and daddy thing ' , and then hide @CAPS3 in a diffrent place to where I know they can't find @CAPS3 . I mean , when you was a child , of course your parents would have yelled at you for going into there room and looking threw there stuff , but then again , you would yell at them for having @CAPS3 when they got older . So don't disaplin your children for @CAPS1 they 'stummbled' on to , you should learn how to hide your stuff better . I'm not saying I would have any of that stuff (why would I need @CAPS3 ?) but , as a student looking into the future , I have a opinion .     Now lets say that you have a couple of maginzines under your bed and your child happens to see them . @CAPS2 they will start looking at them , and some words might come out , but that does not mean they did @CAPS1 wrong , @CAPS3's the parents fault . Like I said before I would hide my stuff better but , then again , I don't need that kind of stuff to live a happy life , I have my children and my husband and that is all I'll ever need .     So before you parents decide to protest about the library having stuff that children are not suppose to see , check your room , hide your stuff so you wont be the embarassed one . No , a library can have whatever they want , @CAPS3's not your place to say what they should get ride of and what should stay.As a student , I stand up and say , No , adult material should not be banned from library's , then you would here the adults complaining and that is @CAPS1 we don't need .",3,2
3674,"The content of a library should be full of various material even if one @MONTH1 find certain materials offensive.  Just because someone @MONTH1 think a material is offensive does that mean we just ignore the subject, forgeting it altogether?  Some subjects @MONTH1 be awkward to talk about, read about, or even think about, but that doesn't mean we should ingnore them.     One subject that @MONTH1 be awkward to read about is sexually transmitted diseases.  You often see people walking through the library skimming through the aisles, once in a while opening a book to see what it's about, but when they come to the section on sexually transmitted diseases they just walk on by, to uncomfortable to be seen in the area.  It's not a subject that people normally read for fun, but everyone should be aware of it. There are many subjects like this that everyone should be aware even if you think it doesn't effect you.     Another reason to keep all books in the library is to be informed of history.  Some history @MONTH1 be gruesome and completely crazy, but we should be aware of those things and not forgot about them.  The @CAPS1 for example.  That was a very dark period in history.  Over six million people died becasuse just one person didn't like what they believed in.  It's sometimes hard to read about, but you should be aware of what happened in the past no matter how depressing it is.  We should be aware to prevent another event like that from happening.     People's likes in music vary.  There are so many different types and styles of music.  Some music @MONTH1 be offensive to other people, but does that mean you should get rid of it at the library?  The library should always have a large variety of different music.  Often people would like to widen there music intellect and the library is the perfect place to do that.      Everyone is different. We never all like the same thing.  Taking materials from the library to avoid the subject doesn't stop someone from finding that information.  If people wanted information and they couldn't find it at the library they would most likely find another way to get that information.  Having a vary in books, music, movies, and magazines make what the library is, a place to learn new things, no matter the subject.",4,4

Katherine Paterson is an auther who, like the quote from her, believes that some books should never reach the hands of children. Does everyone believe the same way,no. I am one of those few people who believe that no one should have the right to remove a book simply because they find the book offensive.     Your an old fashion woman who believes in old fashion ideals such as no cursing or violence. You, as this woman, pick up a book and read the first page, on this page you see cursing and deside to remove all books with violence or cursing from the library. The library soon becomes half empty because of one woman and her belifs. Belifs are a wonderful thing ouside of reading and can make you who you want to be. Books do not, in my opinion, have belifs. This is true for some books but a book where someone runs from danger or flys into the sky, those are not belifs those are dreams and no one can crush dreams offensive or not.     I compair books to dreams simply for the fact that they are dreams, the dreams of the authers who wrote them and wanted to share that dream with the world. Telling a person they can not publish there book simply because another person finds it affensive is telling the auther your dream is offensive. If you do not want your child to share this book of dreams then do not let your child pick up the book. You are the parent of the child who picks up this book then you can protect it from the offensive danger it holds like you protect it from the dangers of strangers in the real world.     Authers do not always write for the sake of everyone. Authers do not write for one woman, one man, one child, authers write for those who share a similer dream. If you do not share the same dream as the auther that is fine, no one is forcing you to share in there sometimes dark and sometimes amazing dreams. Authers write because they wish to write, to express themselfs in ways only words and storys can. Do not shun a book because one thing in it offends you, @CAPS1 a book is @CAPS1 someones dream.     In short you would never crush your childs dreams. If your child wants to grow up and be a fireman you do not tell them that it is offensive to people so they cant. Why would you do something to someone elses dream who you have never met. Be a bigger person and allow that person to live there dream through a story. No matter the level of offiense you do not have to pick up the book and read it. the number one way to not be affended by a book that @MONTH1 affend you is to never read the book to start with.",4,4
3619,"Thoughts of @CAPS1    I feel as though offensive literary pieces should be able to be taken from libraries. If a piece of @CAPS1 is particularly offensive; the piece should not be displayed. From my own experience, controversy is the reason that books are stricken from libraries. All of my experience, observations, and reading have told me one thing. That one thing being, pieces of @CAPS1 are taken away because of their offensiveness.     From the experience that I have had with books that cause controversy, I have noticed myself not liking the book. I believe that is the reason people do not like certain books in libraries. Coming from someone who does not particularly like reading. I feel as though reading something that offends me puts me in a state of mind as though I would not like to read any longer. All of my experiences seem to point to not reading books that cause distress or controversy.     Of all that I have observed, I have found similar things as my experiences. I have seen people, classmates in particular, that do not desire to read because they feel that a novel has offended them. Though my observations @MONTH1 seem one-sided. I truly have observed more lack of reading due to controversy than the increasing of reading due to controversy. All of my observations seem to point to supporting the revocation of 'banned books'.     The piece that I have noticed most prominent to this topic that I have read would most definetly be @CAPS2 @NUM1. In said novel society has outlawed all books. The story seems to heavily favor those who wish to read controversial novels, though we can take something from reading this book. The reading of this novel can be interpreted to favor my argument, as people lived happily without controversial books. Granted not all people did, but that is because of certain variables. From stories, such as the three little pig and the big bad wolf, we can understand how poorly the concept of controversiality is drawn. For instance, I was mortified hearing that the first time. I have never had the interest of hearing it again, as I felt that the story is not politically correct.     Pieces of @CAPS1 are taken away because of their offensive properties. If someone has no interest in reading a book because of the thoughts maintained inside of the text; the book must be stripped from the public. As it would only make sense to try to keep the peace. I for one support the cause to remove books from public places due to controversiality.",4,4
4063,"Freedom of speech is a keen aspect in @LOCATION1 and thats what made our country flourish through many years. In the constitution it states that there is freedom of the press, which means that if something is written that might affend some people, then they have to deal with it. Some might say that some material is offensive, which sometimes it is. However I do not think that the books, magazines, etc. should be taken off the shelfs due to the feelings of another persons thoughts.     In @LOCATION1 over the years things have become more exceptable in media and books.  The rights have always been there but not fully practised. There have been book burnings, banned books, and even people being killed for there writings. For many years it went on until @LOCATION1 changed its way of thinking to a broader more open perepective. Though it still goes on I think that it is very closed minded. In some cases people blamed books that had nothing to do with killing someone, for the reason why they commited a murder.I do think there is a limit to how you distibute certain books and magazines. They shouldnt sell a book about death,poverty,or sex at a public school.      We all have diffrent things we like to read and write about. So why shoud we be taken away from because somone thinks its to offensive. I think not, if you dont like it then put it down and let someone pick it up who will read it. With my own experience i have seen bad people do what is expected of them , bad things. And they try to blame it on a book, story, or @CAPS1 show they had seen. Thats just a easy way out of a situation. I have read and saw very intense things in my life but does that make me want to do  bad things, no!      I know i cant speak for everyone when I say that books, magazines etc. or not harmful. But think about it like this wouldn't sometimes the person reading the stories figure they could learn and embrace from it rather then go out and do what the character did in the story? Reading opens up new things and is scientificly proven to make you smarter in the long run. The more you read the more awareness and knowledge you gain ,and just becuase you read a book about something doesn't mean you support it. It could maybe mean that you want to learn about it so you can understand it more.",3,3
3640,"There are many different types of books, music, movies, magazines,ect., that fill the shelves of libraries and stores across the country. Consumers are constanly taking these items off the shelves without realizing what they are really buying. Some parents @MONTH1 not even realize what their teenagers or little children are actually buying. Some of the material @MONTH1 be offensive and have a bad influence on those who buy into them. But if parents were more careful about what their children buy then there would not be a problem. That is why these materials should remain on the shelves.     One vital reason these items should not be taken away is because it is the consumers choice on whether or not they want to buy or check out these items. People should be able to decide for themselves on what they will or will not buy. If they do not want to buy or check these materials out then then they should just go to another shelf, or shop at another store. I have seen some parents who do not really care what their children buy, and I have also seen parents go the other way. If stores take away these items that it is almost like taking away their right to make a choice.      It is the adult's responsibility if they do not want their children to watch movies that are for mature viewers. The parent should be able to prohibit certain things until their child is old enough to make its own decisions. If they trust their children with these materials then that is their choice. These offensive items can not just be taken off the shelves just because some people are bothered by them. With the way the media works, it would be difficult to remove all these items from libraries and stores. No matter what there will probably always be a way for younger children to be exposed to these materials. On television there is always commercials that will attract kids or teens and influence them to but their stuff. I have also seen music videos and magazines with their favorite celebrities on the covers. It is almost impossible to control every aspect of society to make it appropriate to younger viewers.      If all the people were able to take all the items that they did not approve of off the shelves, then there would be many of these shelves left empty and bare. If everyone were to take a book they did not like off the shelf then there would be a little selection at the libraries. By taking off one of these books, someone could be taking off another persons favorite book. People can not just take books off the shelves because they have some bad language. There is a reason for separating the children's section from the adult's section, and it is because some books might not be appropriate for all readers. From my personal experience I have not seen any problems with kids checking out offensive books. Most little kids are attracted to the children's section because of the colorful pages and simpler words.     There is a variety of materials available to the public that @MONTH1 be offensive to some, especially to their little children. As a parent it is their responsibility to keep track of what their children are being shown. People can not take materials off the shelves because it is only offensive to some. This would not be fair to those who enjoy these kind of materials. If they do not want to buy it then they should simply move on to another shelf or to a completely different store. It is their choice as the consumer on whether or not they want to buy into the many different types of books, music, movies, magazines, ect.",4,4
4150,"When walking into the library and children are finding books, movies and magazines they should not look at. It can be offensive. I believe that it is not the authors fault for the offensive language in their work. I can understand that parents can get upset if their child is reading a book they should not be looking at.     My opinion is that students should be able to choose what they want to read and if it is offensive to them they should stop reading the book. I feel that the student or adult should know if it is harmful to the student or not. Censorship in the library is to find books for everyone to read.     I think that they should not ban anything in the library because it can be used for something useful to the person. I find it hard to believe that libraries will remove every offensive book, movie, or music from shelves because the rating of the item can be horrible.     I just don't think it should be a good idea for them to ban things from libraries if they need to use the information from the book. If it offends them then they should not read the book, and choose another book. Authors work too hard for writing their book and go through the publishing process.      My opinion is a no because I feel they should not remove items off shelves of the libraries because the content of the item is not appropriete to someone. My views can vary when I am older and have children of my own someday. But as of right now I do not think they should remove items off shelves at libraries",3,3
3338,"First off, I do like censorship laws to an extent.  However, the government cannot ban everything that they deem innapropriate.  I think it depends more on what the family deems innapropiate.     I do not think they should have any completely inaccessible areas in libraries for children of younger ages.  I believe that the viewer should have a family member's consent to view said content.  I also believe that if the content is not relative to the viewers interests, then they should just not look at it.  They are not required to look at it so if they do not like it, then they do not look at it.     However, if the library does not consent to holding the books, music, movies, magaines, etc., then they do not have to and the viewer can go somewhere else.  And if they do have the books, music, etc., then they can put limits and ratings on them.  But I do not think that an adult could go in and complain about innapropriate material.  As I said before, if they do not like it, then they are not required to look at it.     I actually think that the government should not tolerate parents whining and complaining about the content of different materials.  One parent should not have the ability to take away others' privilages to books, because they deem it innapropriate.  Just because they do not like the content, does not exclude all others from enjoying it.     Also, if a library does have an age restriction on certain materials, then appropriate acts of discipline should be taken for the viewer of said materials.  However, if the viewer has an adult family member with them and has their consent, then I think they should be able to view the material, regardless of ratings.",3,3
3385,"There are big debates today over whether or not certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves of libraries if they are found offensive.  Plenty of arguments are made from maybe somebody's own experience, observations, and/or reading.  I have read plenty of people's concerns regarding @CAPS1 issue, and there are some valid points to be made from both sides of the story.  No matter what your opinion on @CAPS1 issue is, there will always be someone who opposes of it.  You see censorship of offensive language on television, but here is my take on whether or not censorship should take an effect on books, music, movies, magazines, etc.     The first point that I would like to make about censorship is that people all across the world have come in contact with something that they @MONTH1 have thought to be offensive.  When kids are old enough to understand what other people are talking about, they will come in contact with things that they take in offense at some point in life.  I know from my own personal experience that you will see things that people think should be censored.  Although I come from a religious family who does not like to offend anyone, I am old enough to realize that not everything in life is going to work out your way all the time.  When you honestly think about it, you cannot censor out things that you hear in person, so why censor things in certain materials?     The second point I would like to make about censorship is that no matter how much you try to censor certain materials, people will still find a way to take things offensive.  There are certain things in life that you cannot control, and being insulted or offended is one of them.  Even the most popular man or woman on the planet has been offended at least once or twice.  It isn't about trying to censor every little thing that @MONTH1 be offensive to some people.  Maybe it is about the people learning to deal with a little criticism.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work i abhor---then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is a quote from Katherine Paterson that makes a big statement.  Almost every well-written book that you will find on the shelf has something that should be censored.  What would those books be without those statements?     To conclude @CAPS1 debate on censorship, plenty of arguments have been made about the views of censorship.  Many observations, personal experiences, and/or readings have been done by many different people.  Truth is, there will always be people who disagree on @CAPS1 subject, but that is just the way things are. We @MONTH1 never know who is actually right or wrong about @CAPS1 topic.  We do know though, that judging form the previous points above, it is very unlikely that certain materials will be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.",4,4
3986,"What is the extent of reading that should be read by the public world? There are so many different types of reading and music that many people enjoy as a hobby. Books have been around for centuries and can create a whole new world for readers. The latest gossip can be found in many magazines. Music is sometimes said to help people cope with life problems. Movies can open up peoples' imaginations and make them feel emotions for a theme of no importance. All these things make up peoples lives. Without any of these enjoyments what would people do with their free time? Books, magazines, music, and movies should not be taken off shelves. They're huge factors that make up the society and make life what it is.          Books and magazines are two fun things people love to read. Fiction or nonfiction? No matter if books are real or fake they create stories that interest people. Reading is a hobby that's been around since the beginning of times. There are many different selections in reading, for example, adventure, mystery, comedy, or love stories. People will always read no matter what. Most books read are the ones that are sad and sometimes gruesome, but those are the stories that draw people in. Magazines are often picked up when going into the check out line in a grocery store. People love to read gossip, and learn about the latest trends. Magazines provide a type of self enjoyment for people. When reading a juicy title, most people can't help themselves but to pick up the magazine and learn what's going on in someone else's life.          Music is used for so many different things. It's often listened to when driving down the road. Many people fall asleep to soothing instruments that make a beautiful melody. Lyrics in songs relate to common people and at times it can help a person through a rough challenge. There is something about the different beats songs make that can change peoples' moods. On most @DATE1 nights, it is always seen that movie theatre's are very crowded. Movies bring out imagination and stories where people can watch and follow along. When watching a movie with a sad ending, most people cry. Although not always real, it touches people on an emotional level. Movies can bring things to life.          Life is what it is from contributing factors. All people think differently and like unsimilar things. Books, magazines, music, and movies all relate to peoples' likes and dislikes. Taking things off the shelves because they are offensivc or don't alway make people feel good, won't make our world any better of a place. If anything it will take away happiness in the world. These things make people feel different in ways that can't be described. Most often things that are offensive is the truth. Why hide things that are real? What would writers, musicians, and actors do if they couldn't do something just because it could offend a couple people out of millions? All these things are comfort for some people.          Books, magazines, music, and movies make the world and everyday life what it is. They are simple things in life, but once gone they are a huge gap missing. Things are fun and creative because of books, magazines, music, and movies. In my own experience books make me interested in subjects, magazines fufill my want for reading about celebrities, music makes me feel happy when I am sad, and movies make me feel like I can feel the same emotions as the characters do.They should not be taken off shelves just because they are offensive, they are part of life.",3,3
3819,"The author Katherine Paterson makes a very good point when she states that there are books on the shelf that poeple wish that there kids or even there on self did not read or that people wish they did not read. But if your were to take away ever book someone found offensive there would be hardly any books left in this world. There will always be one person that finds a book that they do not like because of tone the author uses or if they do not like what they call eachother. People all have there own mind sit to away that they want to live or how they want there kids to live.      Having books taken off the shelf because people do not like them would result in having no more books on our shelves. I feel like if there books on the shelves about kids drinking then have bad effects on there life cause they did drink then maybe the kid reading it would stop drinking or not even try drinking. The books about getting raped and them not telling becasue they are afriad of what would happening. Then in the long run telling after they get pregant or injured from it. Them saying that they wish they would have told might help the kids that this happened to or this might happen to might help them feel so relief and tell someone and save themself. Books like these should not get taken off the shelf because one person does not like it, in the long run if they did take it off some could get hurt or not know what to do and it couls be all that one person that did not like it fault. How would you feel if you did that to someone. Maryrin @CAPS1 is a good Author that shows how something that you @MONTH1 think is good but truns out to be really bad. Her books focus a lot on how girls need to watch what they are doing to keep themselves safe.     I have a friend that have parents that do not like the music on her ipod. So she had to take it off. Well with taking it off she made @CAPS2 of the songs that they did not like. She drives so they music is always playing on the radio while she drives so she can listen to the songs that she does not have on her ipod. That is just one example of how you will always get around listening to what you want to hear. Music will always be out there. There will always be songs that poeple do not like. Either due to there religion or even if they do not like the words used. But even if they stop putting songs on the radio there is still internet out there and people can just get there songs from there.     There are songs out there that should not be out there but the more someone tries to push the songs out of the world and out of people listening to them the more some kids or even adults are going to try to listen to them. In the world today there are always a good and a bad song that is the same. Artics now always have a bad song that they would have to make into a good song. That is just how the songs go. That is just how they use there brains. No one can stop them. Not even the people that publish the songs and put then on the radio.      In the long run of things the more people try to stop things from not being in this world the more people are going to try to get them. It is a very bad idea to take the books off of shelves and take music off of the radio. People need to hear what bad things can happen when you do not listen to someone. A kid @MONTH1 grow up knowing not to talk to people they do not know but never really understand what bad could come out of it. But when they read a book about a kid there age getting kidnapped they @MONTH1 understand more clearly on the whys in life.      So if I can say so myself I think that it is a very bad idea for books to be taken off the shelf because one mother or two dads think that book is not good for thier little girl or there teenage son. They need to read it for themself and find out what really could happen if they did something like that. Keep the books on the self. Keep playing the some music. Let your kids or grandchildren find out the danger on there own rather then you just keep telling them. I am a teenage girl and I would rather read about it then having my parents tell me over and over agian. So keep the books on the shelves. That the radio play. Just be safe in doing it.",4,4
3925,"What is @LOCATION1's main idea in the area of art, language, and music? The idea of @LOCATION1 in those catagories is freedom. Freedom is to write what we want, draw what we want, and say what we want, and in all, to express ourselves freely as a person. It is one of the amendments in the '@CAPS1 of @CAPS2', known as freedom of speech.     Saying that, I believe that we should not be able to ban, censor, or remove any books, music, or movies from the @CAPS3 public. It is their right as an @CAPS3 to buy what they want. It takes away @CAPS2 from people, and when they do that, it makes citizens feel like toddlers. They can't choose for themselves what to see and what not to see.     Everything in this world can be offensive to somebody. Just because that one person finds something bad or distasteful, doesn't mean that they have to make everyone else stop seeing it. That's what gives the world its varieties. What someone might think is weird, somebody else might think is normal. When that happens, why is it okay to take away what makes that person feel normal? Just to make the other person feel better?     I walked into the store once before wanting to buy a videogame. I found one I thought looked cool, took it off the shelf, and brought it up to the cashier. He took one look at the game, saw the rating for it, and said that I had to have an adult with me to purchase the game. I went on about how my dad would not care if I bought this game. The cashier said it didn't matter and that I still had to have him here. Then I had to search throughout the store looking for my dad so that he could walk back to the cashier to buy the game for me. What difference did it make? In the end I got the game anyway.      That experience I had at the store that day let me know how it felt to have my wanting of something be shot down. It made me feel like a baby that needed permission to do something. It also helps me know how the writers, artists, and movie directors feel when they get their work censored, rejected, or banned because somebody somewhere found it offensive.      We need to let people express how they feel. If we didn't then a lot of the stuff today would be different. @PERSON1 had the idea of the world not being flat and that he could sail all the way around the world without falling off of it. Everybody thought he was crazy and got angry at his thinking. But he did it, and proved himself right.      Galilaue @CAPS5 thought came up with the theory that the sun did not revolve around the @LOCATION2. He started doing experiments and tried to prove his theory. The people of where he did his work got engraged and through him into exile and imprisoned him. After that somebody thought that it was a good idea, he experimented on it, and the people supported him. Now we have that theory as a fact, that the sun doesn't revolve around the @LOCATION2.      That is what makes freedom of speech so important to the world. It makes people think in different ways. It helps people think of new ideas. Freedom is the key to any way of living.",5,4
3308,"Everyone has their own opinion on censorship in libraries.I think that what libraries choose to put on their shelves should not be censored. Every human being does not have the same taste in what they read, listen to, look at, and watch. In todays generation everyone has their own opinon on censorship. I do not agree with censorship because not everyone likes the same things, has the same thoughts, has the same lifestyle, and wants to learn the same things.     Everyone is an individual and is different in their own way. If libraries wanted to censor what they put out not everyone would get to read, listen, and watch what they wanted. Having libraries censor things would make people feel left out. For example if the library only put out romance things, then what would the action lovers do ? A library is for anyone and everyone who goes to it. One specific type of person does not go to the library.     Everyone grows up in a different lifestyle. Children do not choose their parents. Some parents censor what their kids read and watch,and some do not. Kids who have parents that do not censor what they choose to get at the library might have differnt interests. Not everyone likes the same things.     In school most of the time everyone learns the basic information that is required. Outside of school there is so much more to learn. People can go to librarys' and learn about differnt things that they want to learn about. What people choose to study in their free time can range from drugs and sex to @CAPS1.If libraries censored what people can read, watch, listen to not everyone would get to learn extra information that they wanted to. Libraries can not censor  their materials!     I do not agree with libraries censoring what materials they choose to put out for the public.People are differnt and that is okay. If libraries choose to censor things then not everyone would have equal opprotunities. Parents can censor what their kids read if they want. Not every parents chooses to censor what their kids get at the library; therefore kids have different interests. Human beings do not always want to learn the same things. The librarys' who choose to censor what they put out is not letting everyone have a equal chance to learn. Please let people be who they want to be! Do not censor what libraries put out such as books, music, movies, and magazines",4,4
3162,"Censorship is one of the most broken laws in @LOCATION1.  It is illegal to censor any publication such as books, magazines, music or movies.  Censorship most often occurs with books in a school setting.  Censorship should no longer be tolerated because it affects the writers, school system and escpecially readers.       In the @ORGANIZATION1 every person has the right to express their feelings and opinions on any topic that they want to.  School systems are taking away that right by not allowing them to have a certain book in a school.  Schools should be a place for either all books or a place for no books at all.  The faculty of a school does not have the right to decide what books are allowed in their school based on their own ideals.  It is not fair to the writer to be descriminated agianst, and that writer must have the right to have their book read in any setting.       The next group that censorship within a school system affects is the school system itself.  If a school is allowed to take away one right of a group of people without punishment, then they might start taking away other rights.  In general school systems and teachers are power hugnry leaders of the student body of a school.  They make rules just to display their power over students, and take away many of their rights.  If schools are allowed to continue censoring books, then this could lead to a downward spiral of all being censored.  As Katherine Paterson once said,'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children...take off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove the book I abhor...then you have exactly the same right...And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on school censorship because it is unconstitutional.       The last major group of people that censorship within a school system is the potential readers and students.  Censoring a book is taking that persons ability to learn about, and understand a certain topic that was censored.  Students within a school must have the right to read what they want to read regardless of the schools beliefs and ideals.       In conclusion, censorship in any setting, but escpecially in school must no longer be tolerated because it affects writers, school systems, and potential readers.  Schools are taking away the constitutional right of all potential readers.  The government of the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to crack down on the unlawful practices occuring in schools, around the country, everyday",4,4
3036,"Who cares about unsensored things anyway? Offensive things have been around in libraries, probably since the first library opened. There has been 'offensive' things in a library for as long as i can remember. Now everyone is suppose to share there opinons on pulling these offensive books off the shelve?     What is the differnce between someone saying somthing offense or writing it? Ok, so maybe you dont want your child reading somthing unsensored, but the chances are some other child will say somthing unsensored around him. If there is a book that is so bad you wouldnt want your kids reading, why would it of been published? Publishers do read the books they publish them, they will not publish any random thing. I think that they just need to leave the unsensored things alone. If you cant be mature enough to take a article, book, or magizine seriously, then you dont need to be reading it anyway.                                         In the news or radio you always hear about some boy getting bullied and stuff at school. That isnt because of unsensored things, why dont they blame it on parents and ask where they were at? Parents look at anyone and everyone, but themselves when a kid comes home and has learned a cuss word or somthing. It is never the parents fault.

But we find ways to see it anyway no matter what it is the world has so many sources to get the truth or maybe even lie's to the world we live in. From the media to the press to poparasi maybe even from the people around you they all help the cause of things that should not be being seen by the people.          There thing's out there that we the people don't know nothing about that the goverment and world shields from our eyes. Then there's the things that we are showin by the world like @PERSON1 alot of people think what happend to him is offensive. Not only that but racisim in general also the news why would people put violent things on the news like murder storys and kidnapping and robberys and many more. People find that offensive and even scary to alot of people but yet we keep it on there.                                                                  So no i don't think it should not be removed from shelves and or were ever all things found to be offensive to people are located. Just like when that marine died and gay supportors and protestors were near his funeral chanting with (offensive) thing's. Say thank god for dead soldiers and god hates the army. Nobody stopped that. If we as people are not going to come togeather and work with one another about the things that should or should not be displayed then whats the point of telling someone else what is offensive to you when your going to end up doing it to. And your going to do it with out a care in the world not thinking about who your hurting . Everyone has and opinion and wants to demained it but people are diffrent and some will always see it diffrent than what you see it.                                                       So if you see something offensive in a book or movie or outside. Dont watch it dont read it dont try to hear about it from a friend or stranger leave it alone. We put so much effort into hearing about these offensive things when all you had to do was leave it alone. And then you wouldnt have even known about it. Live life and dont worry about the negative lets focus on the positive of what you see.,3,3
3628,"Censorship in Libraries      I believe that there should be censorship in libraries. In @DATE1's society there are many kids who are hurting and are getting into bad things. There are somethings kids just should not see. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive.      Censorship in libraries can steer kids in the right direction. Odds are, if a kid sees his role model on the front of a movie case smoking a cigarette, then that kid is probably going to become curious about smoking. This has happened to me before. I once saw this kid that I looked up to drinking, and I almost took up drinking myself, but because I had the right peers, I didn't. The point is that when kids see someone they look up to doing a certain thing, it has a great impact. If that movie case is sensored then that kid would never even think about smoking because of his role model.     Every parent is worried about their kid getting into trouble with the law, right? Some of the movies that a kid can get at a library has the actors doing illegal things in it. A kid will see this and then they will probably think it is cool and go out and do the same thing. I have seen plenty of movies that made me want to go out and do what they did in the movie. What if that thing they see in a movie is murder? It maybe crazy to think that a kid would go out and murder someone because he saw people do it in a movie, but it could happen. A couple years ago I can remember reading an article in the newspaper about a kid shooting his father in the head. This kid was only six years old, but he thought that playing with guns was safe because he saw them do it in the movies.      Censorship can take some of the stress off of some parents' backs. Parents stress all the time about where their kids are, what they are doing, who they are with, and so on. If the library censors some of the music and movies that kids watch then his parents will not have to worry too much about him going off and doing bad things because he sees his peers do it. This makes parents feel good and confident in their child's life.      Finally, offensive movies are actually offensive, whether this be to the kid himself, the parents, or the audience that the movie is targeting. Keeping offensive movies censored can relieve a lot of hate in a kid's life. I say this from experience. In movies we always see the smart kids getting picked on and it seems like the athletes get all of the attention. Well I am sort of considered that smart kid. I feel that, because of some of the movies my peers have watched, they find it okay to pick on me. This creates hate inside of their hearts, all because censorship was not used.      In conclusion it has to be obvious that I feel censorship should be used in libraries. Censorship should be used in libraries to steer kids in the right direction, to take some stress off of parents, and because some offensive movies are actually offensive. With censorship, all of these things can be accomplished. This is not only helpful to the kids, but the parents as well. In my experience, censorship is a good thing to have.",4,4
3589,"Censorship is a growing problem is today's world of literature.  Censoring does not always allow the author to thoroughly convey his or her ideas as they were originally intended to.  Katherine Paterson says that if were all aloud to eliminate things that we thought were wrong, then there would be nothing left to be right about.  Censoring leads to an ignorant, opinionless, and clueless society.     In the novel '@CAPS1 @NUM1' censorship is one of the main themes of the story.  Bradbury portrays the burning of books as the way of ending all controversial opinions.  @PERSON3 finds that the burning of books has lead the society that he lives in to be ignorant of what is going on around them.  The government has tried to rule out all causes of controversial opinions in hope that it would make for a happier society.  When in reality, members of the world are not happy and are consistently showing the reader that they do not know how to be happy.  @PERSON3 decides that he wants to learn, but he does not know how. The brain is a muscle, if it is not excercised correctly, it becomes weak and useless.  So when he tries to memorize a part of the @CAPS2, he cannot retain what he has been reading.  Such as trying to fill a sieve full of sand, he does not know how to learn.     The members of this novels society are basically opinionless on what is happening in their world.  What they are told on the television is thought of to be factual, and that is what they do all day.  In school, kids are being fed fact after fact and are expected to agree with what they are being told with no questioning involved.  In a normal society, learning leads to questioning.  But for them there is no learning, just accepting.  And acceptance leads to contentness, which in the end leads to unhappiness.     The society in '@CAPS1 @NUM1' proves to be oblivious to everything that is going on in many different ways.  To them, death is not a big deal.  @PERSON2 was killed by a speeding car, and @PERSON4, @CAPS4 wife, was not even shocked to hear it.  Another example is when @PERSON3 was running from the police, and a car full of rambunxious teenagers attempted to run him over just because they wanted to.  At the end of the novel, @PERSON3 is walking along the railroad tracks with his new friends and the entire city is blown to dust by bombs dropped by fighter planes.  The city had no idea that this was going to happen, they were clueless to the war that was going on around them everyday!  A clueless society is a useless society, and in the end they were destroyed.      Censorship lies within the hands of the viewer.  Censorship has become such a big problem in the world when there are so many other things people should worry about.  Reading about somebody doing drugs will not make a child want to do drugs, it crosses every teenagers mind atleast once.  But instead of not allowing them to even realize that it is out there, parents should do what they signed up to do, teach your kids right from wrong and hope that you did it well.",4,4
4255,"Have you ever been reading something that made you mad? Well, to be honest I can't remember the last time I walk into a librarie and found something there that could had offended somebody. But thats just me, I'm sure that there is stuff out there that could really get to a person.      No, I don't that materials should be removed from shelves if they are found offensive. People go to libraries to find out information on stuff that they don't know. If you are checking something out then you already know that there is a possibility of something that you don't agree with. I think it should be anybody business than the person checking it out.     Now, I'm not the type to get all frustrated or upset from something that I have seen on a shelve, but I could image that there are people out that are like that. If I had found something that I disagreed with I would not read it or just think nothing of it. I also think that you should be prepared before walking into a public place where they have all kinds of reading material. To you it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to others its hilarious.     All I'm trying to say just do'n get all upset over something that you have read.",3,3
3236,"Books, books, and more books. There are so many of these spine bound papers, filled with everything from basic @CAPS1 about life, all the way to stories that capture the minds of faithful readers and take them to far off distant worlds. If we were to take all the books in the world and line them up in a perfect row, we would be able to create a bridge of knowledge and iformation far enough to stretch around the moon twice and back. The problem is, that with all of this @CAPS1 and knowledge, there are young minds that are not yet ready to soak it all up. There is no such thing as bad @CAPS1. There is only people who are not yet ready for the @CAPS1 they are about to obtain. So should these materials that open up doors to new minds sets, and feelings such as books, music, magazines,  and movies be censored? That answer is yes.     First off, there is a certain degree of modesty and curiousity that needs to be kept in children. Children need to have a hunger for knowledge to become great learners, and intellegent minds. If the @CAPS1 given to them does not come in the chronological order of importance in which it needs to, this will poison there minds and twist them in to something they were not yet ready to become.     Secondly, @CAPS1 presented to kids to early can harm them physicaly. Children are born with the instict to repete what they observe. This is a primal instict that humans will forever have, and is essential for living life. So take movies for example. If a child watches movies that involve sexual themes, and actions, this can be very harmful to them physicaly. If a child experiences these things to soon, they will want to simply repete what they saw. Then what is next? The answer to that question is easy. There will be more teen mothers than there are needed.      Lastly, premature @CAPS1 can harm mentaly. Take music for example. Music is an even larger gateway to mental damage then movies are. This is simply a result of bad censorship. Many think that music is not as bad as movies because you can not see anything visually, but they are wrong. Music is even worse because children can picture what ever they want to based on what is being said in the lyrics. There needs to be tougher ristrictions on music. Restrictions such as age for purchase should be raised, That is about the only way that explicit content can be blocked.     In conclusion, there should be better censorship restrictions on certain materials. But I do not beleive that the materials that @MONTH1 be harmful or offensive should be remove as whole. Simply because adults do have the right to view these materials. Libraries around the world need to better there restrictions, even laws to stop poisoning the minds of our young. We people as a whole need to come together to make this happen. After all, the children are the future of our world",4,4
3163,"What is this world coming to?  We have stooped to the level of installing offensive materials in libraries where anyone can check them out. Being a daughter and teenager myself, I personally have had the experience of reading some of these offensive books and magazines.  The sex, drugs, and violence used to create a story, have destroyed the minds of our youth.  I strongly feel this disturing and destructive material should be removed from the shelves of libraries.          I do not question whether children and teens should read, but rather what they read.  I agree reading helps our youth learn and excel in schooling, but offensive books and magazines put nasty ideas into their minds and distort their way of thinking.  The more our younger generation reads about these ugly things, the more curious they become.  I feel they will eventually let curiousity get the better of them.      Many would say that experiencing activities such as sex and drugs is all apart of growing up, but I disagree.  Trying any one of these harmful activites portrayed in certain library materials could put you and your health in severe danger.  It only takes one time to become pregnant or become addicted to drugs.         To better prove my point, think of your favorite book.  Did you look up to any of the main characters? Did you want to be just like him/her?  Well it seems to me that this malicious material makes the main character and hero of the story a bad role model.  They @MONTH1 save the world and be a hero by day, but authors and producers make sure they include their night life in the story as well.  This tells our children that it is okay to do these things, when it is the exact opposite.     I stand by my opinion and believe offensive books, magazines, and movies should be removed from the shelves of libraries.  This material plants a bad seed in the mind of our youth.  It leads them to believe everyone, including their heros in books and movies, does these things.  Sex, violence, and drugs are not what this world was made for",5,4
3194,"Katherine Paterson said ' If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. ' In this quote I think she was trying to get across that if someone picks up a book or a magazine and reads it and then puts it back and maybe its not the best book ever to them and they @MONTH1 find it offensive, but someone else comes along and wants to read it and they @MONTH1 not find it offensive, then you have two different view points on a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to one person, but to another it @MONTH1 not be. Different view points really effect how to censor books, because of how people are so different, there difference on how they feel about a book could effect what should happen to that book.     I dont believe that books, movies, music, magazines, and other materials such as those should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive to someone. If they are found offensive to a bunch of different people then yes they should be removed, but if its only bothering one or two people but there are other people that agree that its not offensive, then dont get rid of it just because of a couple people. Take a vote maybe to see how many people agree and dissagree on keeping or getting rid of it then decide whether or not you should keep or get rid of it off of that vote. I think it would be more fair and satisfactory to take a vote on whether or not it is fair to keep or remove it. If someone has a memory about something they read or remember an experience from it and then someone else reads it and feels offened by something its not fair to the other person to get rid of it. Its especially not fair to the person with the memories and experiences.     So dont  remove books just because a couple people might find it offensive, take a vote to decide. Let more than just a few people deciede on behalf of the book. More than just a few people can make an impact on just one book, and you never know what differnt views you @MONTH1 find from different people on just one book. People need to be able to discuss their veiws on the book and then bedate on whether or not to keep it, so dont choose to get rid of them without several view points on the book.",3,3
3685,"I think that a library should be just books because that what they are made for. If we started putting movies in the librarys why put books in the libraries. I think it should be one or the other. If movies were in libraries i think that people would get more movies than books, and just think how it would be if you put music in a library also. I do think that a magazine is a book.     Movies should stay in a movie store of at the movie theater. not in libraries. Music should stay on the radio or in stores not in libraries. People would lose intrest in books if people started putting movies and music in libraries. I think they are trying to put technology in libraries and im not for that.     If music and movies were at libraries their would be no need for books and people would stop buying books. We need books they are the oldest but most acreart way to express yourself or tell a story. but now they want movies or music.",2,2
3067,"How would you feel if you were at your local library and you found something with something offensive in it? Many people would not approve of having offensive materials in their library. The library is open to anyone and anyone could see the material. Library's should make sure there isn't anything offinsive in their materials before they put them on the shelf.         Everyone has access to the library in your district and can look at anything that is there. A lot of stuff that can be found in your library could be offensive; but how would people know what is offensive and what isn't? Library's shouldn't have that accessable. If they still have it in your library, then it should have a warning on it or be on a high shelf. Library's should be aware of what they are putting on the shelves and know if it is appropriate or not.         Furthermore, children also have access to the public library. Most of the time the child will have an adult with them but sometimes they can pick up something before you can stop them. If there is something offensive in a child's reach, they might grab it and see whats in it. Most librarys have a childrens section where you can trust that there isn't anything offensive in it. Not all children will just go to the childrens section so there shouldn't be offensive material in library's or at least in childrens reach.         Lastly, librarys choose what they put on the shelves and they never know who will look at it. If there is offensive material in their stuff then anyone can see it and it could put a negative thought in some peoples heads. There are some people who are mature enough to see the offensive material but there are others who can't. Thoes that can't, it @MONTH1 reflect something negative on them and it @MONTH1 cause problems. Therefore, there should not be offinsive material in librarys.     In @CAPS1, librarys should not supply offinsive material. If there are people that want to see that kind of stuff there are other ways of getting that material. There shouldn't be access to that in your library because everyone can see it and you don't know how it will effect them. If there is going to be offinsive material in your library there should be an adult area where only people over the age of @NUM1 can enter. If there is something offinsive that is open to anyone, hopefully one day librarys will elimanate them.",4,3
4111,"Have you ever been in that situation where you couldn't read a book because of someone else having bitter feelings towards it? Are you furious when you finally get a chance to read that book you've been waiting on for two months and all of a sudden it's not to your avalible because of its content? I know I always amd because at @ORGANIZATION1 this happens quite often. I believe that a book shouldn't be removed because only one person found it to be offense. Sure some novels @MONTH1 expose a few word of profanity or discrimination but everyone has to deal with it. So why take one book off the shelf for saying something vaulger because not everyone might dislike the book. If we took a book off the shelf everytime someone reported a bad word or a discrimitive remark then we would be left with no books including the ones that tell us a great deal about past history.     Some authors, movie directors and artist rely on history to help them create a great piece of reading, comentary, or lyrics. If the libraries in the public and in schools censored everything there could be a @ORGANIZATION1 risk of loosing alot of historic and epic material or information from the past. As im sure you know alot of history books about the holucaust, slavery, and the civil rights movement include words that people of certain genders or races @MONTH1 find offensive. These words are a vital source in the attempt to explain what the people in those situations are going through; therefore those words shouldn't be reported for histories sake.     I know im not alone in my fight to keep books on the shelf because an author named Katherine Paterson says, ' ... If i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same righ and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). In this quote she is trying to say if people abuse this policy there will be no books left on the shelf for anyone to read becasue someone found something offensive to them. This is what will eventually happening if we don't censor the @CAPS1 in the libraries.     Now don't mistake me for someone who believes that @CAPS1 should be dropped all together becasue I believe it is needed in some cases. If there is a song that use profanity multiple times without any logical reasoning then it shouldn't be availible to the public through a library. Also if there are inappropriate movies I don't think that they should be distributed by the library to the public becasue thats what movies rental stores are for. On the other hand I haven't found a single book that isn't suitable for the library; so why are there so many books being takin away every year due to what some people call '@CAPS1' also known as  self opinions?     In this writing my goal was accomplished; I wanted to let everyone know that the whole @CAPS1 thing is getting a little out of hand. We all know that there is some offensive things that @MONTH1 be happening but they are things that everyone who views that book, movie, or soundtrack has to deal with. With some offensive things comes a reasoning like in history books and movies that @MONTH1 contain a few bad words but are used to get a point or setting across. I know that @CAPS1 is just another way of looking out for the better of humans but alot of it has a reason. The only case where @CAPS1 should be used is in innapropriate movies and songs with no hisrtoric purpose. With all that has been said, do you still believe in all of the @CAPS1 going on in your nearby library? How can you help prevent the destruction of all of the historic words in libraries?",4,4
3894,"You are not elgible to check out this book', says the libranian. You are just too young for this book.      To me censorship laws in libraries are not needed. The common people should have the liberty to check out what ever they please. The people who make the censorship laws should be pleased that young people actually want to read.     Books, music, movies, magazines, etc., are all under censorship. Everyonee takes things in differently, being said some are mature than others. If they want to play that game, or read that book they should be allowed. The person who picks up the product should know how they are and should know if they can handle the material. Therefore they are held accountable for their actions. Isnt that how legal laws are carried out?     If any sort of content is found offensive it still shouldnt be removed from the shelves. Something @MONTH1 seem offensive to one person but someone else @MONTH1 find that interesting. For example, when the newspaper talks about a specific athlete they @MONTH1 say things tha offends his?her fans. They people who are not fans of him/her @MONTH1 find it ammusing; so they should remove the post because some people dont like it. Someone @MONTH1 like that book, music, movie, or magazine dont inconvience them because of a few people.           Interest @MONTH1 vary, but a teen @MONTH1 like the same type of books as an adult. Censorship laws wont  let the teen read the book they likes because of his/her age, and to me that is unfair. It is a new day and age; things have changed from what they once were. Cencorship laws should be wiped out completly. If you @MONTH1 find a book offensive in any way, shape, or form just dont read it. Nobody is forcing to read that specific book; libraries are filled up with a numerous amount of books. There is a book out there that you will enjoy.     In conclusion, certain material shouldnt be removed from shelves if found offensive. Some other peoople @MONTH1 like that same aterial. There shouldnt be censorship laws in libraries at all. That is just unfair, and unjust to some people. Its a new time and age and things are different. People of any age should be able to check out any book they please",3,4
3111,"The right to remove a book off of a shelf is not good thing to do. My view on the subject is that, if this begins there will only empty shelfs in librarys across the country. Once the removing of books start there will be hardly any left.     We use books everyday, for students we use them to learn and for a entertainment during someclasses. Books help us learn things, like new words we've never heard of before, or some major point in history we should know about. Even as adults some of them like to read in there free time.     I think its wrong to remove a book off of the shelf, just because a few or a bunch of people think its inaproprate. If it is the librarys should have section for those books that dont let the little kids go in that section. their is a problem for this idea, what books should go into this section of the library? A way to solve that question would be to elect a nation wide library service to set it up and have people vote on which books to to remove or put into a speacial section in the librarys across the nation. This idea goes the same for everything found at a library.     Another soulution to this matter is that, the librarys across the nation have another labeling system like the dewey decimal system but use both. this new system could contain information like reviews from crtics about the book, or what happend during the book. This would inform the reader more on what he is about to engrossed in for the next week or so.     The books, music, magazines found in librarys should be left their for a reason. Sombody wrote, or composed for a reason. so people like you and me can enjoy good stories in books and read informing magazines ad listen to good music",3,4
4735,"I think that if the books,music,magazines,or movies you have in a library is not offensive, then they have the right to put them on the shelfs.Theres nothing wrong wit havin music and magazines at a library because what if someone doesnt like to read but loves listening to music or doesnt like to read books but likes to read magazines.I think its all right to have movies too.They could have alot of educational movies of just some plain regular movies of all kinds.Now if a book or movie or magazine or music was found and it was offensive then they should be takin off the shelf.If the books,music,movies, or magazines are not offensive in any way, they have the right to be on does shelfs so everyone can use them.",2,2
4765,"Books are very important to our society. They hold a special place in our hearts, and contain much of our world's knowledge. Everyone has their own opinion about what should or should not be placed in books. I definetly agree that little children should not purchase a book that has explicit content in it that they should not read. However, some people, myself included, have checked out or bought books and then realized what exactly was portrayed in those books. I do not believe that anything that contains certain contents should be removed from the shelves.     I can think of many books that could be taken offensively that are still on many school library and public library shelves. Any books about the @CAPS1 and even the @CAPS2 @CAPS3, such as '@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' can be taken in the wrong context. These books do contain language that is not appropriate for children. But we do still see them on our shelves. Why? Because those books, and many others, are very important to us.     Books should stay on their shelves because, as Katherine Paterson cleverly put it, '... And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS7 means that if everyone took out books that they felt were personally offensive then there would be no books. Books are vital to learning things. We put all of our knowledge into them, even hundreds, if not thousands, of years ago. When the libraries in @LOCATION2 were burned and/or destroyed, we thought our knowledge was gone forever. Thank goodness for the back-up system that no one had known about out in the @LOCATION1.     I myself have read the @ORGANIZATION1. I believe it whole-heartedly, but I do know of people who do not believe in the @CAPS8 and have taken some things that are said in the @ORGANIZATION1 to be taken personally. I believe that the @ORGANIZATION1 is the most important book in the world. Without the @ORGANIZATION1 no one would know of the wonderful things that our @CAPS8 above has done for us, and what he is doing for us now. However, some people can take what the @ORGANIZATION1 says to be offensive in regards to homosexuals and divorces. But would we allow the gays or divorced men and women to take the @ORGANIZATION1 off of the shelves? Of course not!If we would not allow them to take off that ever so important book, then why should we allow to have other books to be removed?     Books are so very important to us and our world. They hold our world's knowledge, and they also hold our hearts. Just think about what our world, our knowledge, our society would be like if we did not have these precious things. Can you imagine it? I cannot. Books are one of the most important things that we have in @CAPS7 world. Just because someone finds something offensive in a written work does not mean that everyone else will, too. Books, if they are offensive to anyone, should be kept on our shelves for our future generations to come so they @MONTH1 learn and grow on our knowledge of our past",4,4
4755,"Why do we have books out there that are viewed as offensive? If they are inapropriate, why do we keep putting those books, magazines, movies, and the big one, music out there in the world? Let me tell you why, because people in @LOCATION1 unfortunatly, have grown out of @CAPS1-duty time, @PERSON1, @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and many other nonoffensive shows. But with the shows, books, and movies played today are very inapropriate to the younger viewers.      @DATE1 @TIME1 cartoons are over, at least the good cartoon like @CAPS4 and @PERSON3, @ORGANIZATION1, @CAPS5, ect, these cartoons, that I used to watch, that taught me how to be @CAPS6, @CAPS7, and @CAPS8 have faded away. With the cartoons out now that are supposed to be good for children, all show @CAPS22 the same thing and that @CAPS22 @CAPS9, @CAPS10, @CAPS11, and all the other @NUM1 deadly sins. They show these without explaning anything that can help the child in life, and that @CAPS22 @CAPS12.     We can @CAPS23 take books off the shelves, make directors' quit directing, rappers' quit rapping, or make the pornoghraphy stop but we can restrict it to a point. It will always be out there weather it @CAPS22 by the blackmarket or the adult stores.Thankfully there are ways around letting your children watch these shows. Restrictions on the television, make the offencive books, magazines in a library to a(n) restricted area to where no one can enter without being @NUM2 years old.     There @CAPS22 a lot to say about the music out there. It can be and @CAPS22 very offensive. I was born and raised on the old fasion country music and unfortunatly country music has gone to the dogs. Sorry to say but the change in music started at the begining of the @LOCATION2 @CAPS13, with the hippies. While they where all hopped up on @CAPS14, @CAPS15, and @CAPS16, they brought to life the new @CAPS17 and @CAPS18. So it has been here over @NUM3 years it @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going away. All we can do @CAPS22 hope our children does @CAPS23 turn on the radio that @CAPS22 tuned into that crap and say '@CAPS19 that sound like good music.'     With the pornoghraphic magazines, they have been around since @PERSON2 was in her prime. It @CAPS22 @CAPS23 going to stop whatever we do. All we can do @CAPS22 block it out of our lives. We can try and keep it out of our childrens eyes but it will @CAPS23 help they will always be known to this world.     I think we should move these things to another part of the library, that only adults can get to if that can be done in the library. Then we will move onto the music, and then the shows. Remember it will always be out there, all we can do as @CAPS20 @CAPS22 try to keep it out of reach of our children. We can't stop it but we can try and keep it out of there eyes. With the will power of @CAPS20 it CAN be done.FAILURE @CAPS22 @CAPS23 @CAPS24 @CAPS25!!!",4,4
4161,"Offensive material shouldn't be taken off the shelves at all. Books are written on various of topics from love to sci-fi. Everyone is offended by something; if all of us could remove a book that we precieve as offensive then the human race wouldn't read anymore.     @PERSON1 had to demonstrate this in a similar aspect to congress concerning his music lyrics. @PERSON1 is the reason why there is an '@CAPS1' sticker on @CAPS2's that contain offensive lyrics. Books SHOULD @CAPS3 be censored at all. It hides the authors thoughts, idea, and meanings behind their writing.     I've read hundreds of books from @LOCATION2 to @LOCATION1. The aspect that a parent is worried about what their children might read implies parents need to step in. Having an one-on-one talk about the books context with their child could solve this uneasiness parents have about books.     Pre-@CAPS4 to @CAPS5 to @CAPS6 requires many stages of growing physically and menatally. Through those phases kids learn from various sources including negative ones. It's up to the parents to ensure that tomorrow's generation can depict what is truthful and what is false.     My grandmother shared a memory about when I was @LOCATION1 learning to read. I was reading out of a @CAPS7 magazine; yes the magazine is intended for adults but I obtained the skill to read from it. A skill that will propell me into job oppertunities and assist me in everyday life.",3,4
4230,"Offensive @CAPS1     @CAPS1. Books, music, magazines, movies, commericals. Is it right to have all types of @CAPS1 shown to all ages? I disagree. A variety of people could take offense to the content this @CAPS1 contains. I think that there should be a designated area, or all the alarming @CAPS1 should be removed so everyone can be at peace when they are at the library, or just watching television in their own home.      Even though some people @MONTH1 not take offense to any type of @CAPS1, you have to think about the parents. A majority of parents would not want their children to be surrounded by all the effects that this @CAPS1 brings. Some content @MONTH1 not be suitable to younger kids. Whether it be going to the movies or just going to the library, children can see all the violence and misbehaving going on in the world today. I believe that drugs, alcohol, and curse words have a big influence on kids these days. I think it is our responsibilty to protect them until they are at an age they can make their own judgements.      Religion. Our religion plays a big part on what we think is right or wrong. I was taught to always treat people with respect and to try my hardest to get along with others. A lot of the @CAPS1 contradicts what I have been taught. If you see something on television with your favorite actor or actress on it, we tend to believe it is acceptable behavior. If you have ever been to a movie theater, you know they have certain ratings. The ratings are there to protect younger kids from getting into adult movies. They enforce this rule to an extent, but I don't think they enforce it enough. At the least, libraries and movie rental places could have a designated area for adult rated content to respect those who disagree.      A few years ago when my little sister was about two or three, she was watching a movie with me and it had a few curse words in it. She had never heard them that often and wasn't sure what they meant. For the next couple of days, she went around saying the word and my parents weren't very happy. She had no idea she was doing anything wrong because she heard it on a movie and if they could say it, then she could too. Children sometimes don't know any better and if they would happen to say it to a stranger, they would be offended.      @CAPS1 can be harmless, but it can also be offensive. The safest way to keep the new generation respectful, is to shield them when they are young so that they can learn what is right and what is wrong. When they come out into the real world, they won't be difficult to put up with and will have proper manners. No one will ever agree on the same things, but in the end, we need to do what is right for the betterment of our community.",4,4
3533,"Should books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive to public be removed? No,  I strongly disagree.           Should books that @MONTH1 be offensive to others no because there are hundreds and thousands of different books and even more. All books have different themes and subjects and all readers have different opinions on them. For example say there is a book about abortions and you want to know more about this subject so you deside to check it out. In the line behind you is a women who tells you not to purchase this book because she disagrees with killing a baby and tells the owner to cancel this book for that reason. No this would not happen just because someone hates or dislikes something it could very well be something someone loves and enjoys.     Here are some reasons why you would agree to removing somethings off the shelves like sex. Things such as sex @MONTH1 offend people because you @MONTH1 beileve it promotes sex to young teenagers or young kids but thats not the case. Most books on sex teaches you the right and wrong things to do and how to stay self. People need to understand that @PERCENT1 of teens world wide are sexually active and books that @MONTH1 help you to protect yourself and others.      In conclusion there are many people that @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not like the books or other things that they find offensive but every one has there opinion. You cant take things away just because of one person that would not be far to a individual with a problem that is seeking help or information on there personal problem. For these reasons I disagree with taking away items that @MONTH1 be offensive to others because everyone is different in this world and that should not change because of a disagreement or opinion someone has on you.",4,3
3346,"Should books, magazines, or movies that are found offensive be removed from the shelves? I think that the book, magazine, or movie should stay on the shelf even if it is found offensive. If it is offensive to one person, it doesn't mean that it is to every person. Everyone has their own view on the subject of offensive or not.     I don't think the person that wrote the book or magazine meant for it to be offensive. They were just writing what they thought went along with the story and some people took offense from the book or magazine. But, they shouldn't argue over it because, like I said before, the author probably didn't mean for it to be offensive.     In conclusion, the books should stay on the shelves. Everyone has different point of view. The author probably didnt mean for the book or magazine to be offensive.",2,2
3479,"A library is a place to go and find books, music, and other things. It's a big resource ; it has a huge variety of help for people. Question is , is everything that you can have access to be removed from shelves if there found offensive?     If books, music , or anythingelse on the shelves were found offensive they should be removed off the shelves. They should have a section for those certain kind of materials. To accsess  that certain material you would have to have a librarians permission that way it can't come off offensive to anyone. Your probably asking why you couldn't leave it on the shelf. You can't just leave it on the shelf because it could be offensive to someones cultural beliefs or seem inappropriate to the youth. So therefore thats why they would have to be removed.     I do believe they should be remooved for those various reasons. Libraries are a place to go to be used as recources or fun. Everyone who goes to a library should have everything to there needs.",3,3
3112,"Libraries should never remove any material just because it @MONTH1 be found offensive.  Something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be to another.  If the material was so offensive that it went against the law, then it probably wouldn't have been published in the first place.       People often get offended if they read, see, or listen to something that goes against their personal views, ethics, or religion.  But people need to learn to understand that other people think differently and have different values.  Though peoples' opinions differ, each opinion is equally important to that certain person.     So many media sources today are censored that it is essential to keep a place where people can freely obtain material and express opinions.  As a student I often have a hard time finding meaningful literature in the school library because it is so censored.  I am not complaining about this because I understand that schools have to be careful of what they are exposing students to.  But if I am looking for something maybe more religious, derogoratory, or less accepted, it is nice to have a public library where I can find these things.       In closing, if people are offended by something on the shelves of a library then they shouldn't read, watch, or listen to it.  But do not censor everything so that people who do enjoy these materials can no longer easily access them",3,3
3285,"I think that if certain materials are offensive that they should be taken off the shelf, depending on how they are offensive. If they are offensive by rachism or being prejudice i think they shouldnt be on the shelfs. Also if it is offensive to women or men then it should be taken off of the shelfs. People should be able to read and listen to stuff without being offended by it.     I think that if it is offensive to different races then yes it should be taken off the shelfs. I think this because, children can read this and then, they would beleieve that it is right to be races against other races. I think that children and other people should be able to read and listen to stuff without it offending others. Also they should be able to do this and not learn how to be offensive to others.      People reading these things that are offensive could cause problems with others. It could cause problems for the libraies also, doing this by people not wanting to come back due to the fact of they have offensive material. Then with people not wanting to be there then the libraies wont have enough service and they will have to close.      I also believe that if the masterial is offensive to women/men then it should be taken off the shelf. The magazines that have women and men in them can be offensive, because  alot of people look at them like they are trash. It makes a bad impression on some people. Its rude for it to be there. It puts not very good thoughts in some peoples heads.     I believe that if material being read of listened to is offensive then it should be taken off the shelf. It can cause many problems with others. It could cause us to lose libraies if others choose not to go anymore. Things should not be left around if they are offensivce in any way.",4,3
3037,"When you were a child how much did you learn from books?  Books are filled with great stories of far-away lands, accounts of real events, and poems with powerful meanings.  All of those books were written by an author with a clear point to make. Those books should not be censored from libraries because of words or ideas that are found offensive.  Children have to learn these things some time in their life and I think the earlier they learn the less trouble it will cause them later in life.  There are also freedoms in the @LOCATION1 that grant us freedom of speech.  Shouldn't there be a freedom to read as well?     Authors are brilliant people.  Without them, there would be no books for anybody to read.  We should all respect authors and what they put into their books.  This means when an author believes that a certain word or action fits in a book, we should leave that book alone and respect what the he or she chose to put in it.       When I was a child I picked up on everything.  I was a very inquisive as any kid my age would be.  I remember wandering around my public library scanning the rows of books and reading the titles.  There were books about politics, religion, sex, and violence.  However on the other side of the library, there were books about children escaping their own world and traveling through time in a magical tree house.  There were even stories about mice who had feelings and normal conversations amongst themselves!  The library is great because of the plethora of knowledge contained in the unrestricted inventory of books.  As I grew older, I began to dwelve into more adult books such as politics and religion.  I then formed my own personal opinions on what I gathered from the books.  Without those books in that library I would have never been able to research those topics.     There is an amendment in our @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 that  promotes freedom of speech in the @LOCATION1.  This allows for anybody to say whatever they please as long as they don't infringe upon the @CAPS2 of anybody else.  The definition of library is a place where people can read and check out books from library and return them when they please.  Libraries should allow every book in their collection because every book has some sort of value.       Taking a book out of a library because of offensive material is not right because books are important no matter what is inside of them.  Some books @MONTH1 have material that might not belong in the hands of children.  Children need to learn those things sometime in their life.  Why not now?  Books are what have taught all of us.  Please let them keep teaching",4,4
4299,"If you take offense to certian things, you shouldn't read the peices of literature that make you feel like that. Ask some of your friends or research the book/magazine before you read it. Sometimes the front can be decieving so make sure you read the description first.     Many people that read certain things @MONTH1 take them the wrong way and think they say something they dont really mean. Which is why they take offense to it, but the more you understand a peice of literature the less you are offended. You should try to at least accept some of what the book/magazine says just incase you need it in the future.     You @MONTH1 get upset when you read something for the first time, and @MONTH1 not notice that it could help you when you think about it. Thinking about things is a great way to learn how to deal with being offended, just look from both points of view. They both could have good ideas and functions to them.     Try avoiding them if you are still offended by them, don't read a lot of book/magazines that have offensive things in them. Ignore the adds on the television or computers that have more than what you need to know in them or if they make you feel uncomfortable watching them. If you read them it could make you feel worse or make you mad. Sometimes they can even make you stess a little.     If you are really offended by something the best thing you could do is avoid it. Avoiding something helps you to not read them or think about them. This works for a lot of situations not just this one, so if you need to get away from the stress just ignore them.",3,3
3535,"Censorship in libraries is an inportant thing in schools and in the public. It is inportant beause some of movies, books, and magizines have a bigger influince on the kids then most people think. Like some of the really gory movies the are always people in the movie gettin cut up or shoot. Do you really think that some kids dont think about hat stuff. Somtimes the kids can get it in there head that they can do what they see or read.     Like in the movie @LOCATION1 @CAPS1 they are beating up and killing people just because they are colored. And some kids @MONTH1 think that that is ok. And they can go down to there librarie and just get it off the shelf and check it out and go home and watch it. Now if you r using it as a thing to teach kid that it was the way things use to be and that it is wrong then that is ok. You can teach your kids all you want just make sure that it is the wright thing.     And some magazines that are in the schools or in the public librarie are just not the kind of thing that kids should not be looking at. Like the gun magazines or the hunting magazines the just show that it is ok to carie a gun were ever they go. And the hunting magazines just show that you can go out and shoot stuff. And some kids @MONTH1 be confused that you need a lisense to do all of that. You have to at least put and age limmiet of some stuff.     Go's the sameway with some of the books they always start out good and then the just turn into a big mess of gor and vileance. Like the spere it started out with a group of people going under water to explore a ship. And they find a big shpere and they go in it and get these powers and they imagin it and it comes true. Well when a kid reads that they @MONTH1 think that they can do that and they start imaging that they can eather hurt or really do some damage to someone. And then when they find out that it wont work they @MONTH1 do it to them themselves.     So it just come to show that you should censor some of the stuff that you have in your libraries and if you can take them out then at least put and age limite on them",3,3
4300,"Books can always be amazing things in how they take us to whole new worlds and how they enlighten us to new ideas we @MONTH1 have never thought about before.  However, are some books just too much to handle and should not be read?  Well think what you @MONTH1, but I believe all reading and media materials should stay on their shelves in libraries because people should have a right to know what is in the real world, even some of the bad parts.  Different assortments of media should definately not leave libraries or be banned from them because people need to be educated in all that exists, they need to know even the bad things in this world so they can hopefully be educated enough about it they can go away from evil acts and help fight against them, and first and foremost it is their right to choose what they want to read because each individual must have the option to be who they want to be.  Though we can only hope that by giving people such knowledge they can rise up and do what is right.     Even education @DATE1 is being influenced by people saying that students can not be taught certain realms of knowledge, but in the long run does this really help people?  If people were educated enough to know about everything we know and what they themselves as an individual choose to learn, wouldn't that help them from becoming curious and learning lies from an invalid source, instead of the array of resources they would have open to them at a library?  Each individual should have the right to learn what they want to learn and should not be closed off from any resources, otherwise they @MONTH1 never learn the real truth behind a topic, which would work against the whole point of learning.  These seekers of knowledge should always be able to seek as they please, so that they @MONTH1 learn and hopefully make new advancements for everyones benefit, but they can only hope to this with proper education.         Another point to look at is that people need this variety of education, so they can work for causes important to them.  With knowledge people can make new innovations and create and spread new ideas to help make the world better.  Although  this can only happen when they know both sides of the story, so that if they oppose something they can know what they are talking about and what they are pushing against and what cause they are pushing for.  The only way people can truly make their ideas heard will be when they can understand all about their topics.  Without certain points of information that could be taken out, people @MONTH1 have no backbone to what they are saying and then they would even hamper other people's learning processes as well.     Also another reason to not have censorship is that we all have rights in @LOCATION1,and hopefully globaly someday, to be who we want to be in the pursuit of happiness as long as we do not hinder anyone else's dreams in our own pursuit.  People really just need to be who they really are in order to help the world and make differences, because if we were not allowed to be our own individuals then people would never advance.  Without this advancement, people would have just remained the same in their cultures and beliefs, but instead people chose to seek knowledge, and in doing so gave us the technology people have @DATE1.  Harry @CAPS1 even argues in his popular books series that we must know the enemy to fight them.  Would he have become such a hit if others didn not believe this as well?  To change this would go against the rights people have found for themselves, thus meaning if we gave these rights away, people would have regressed.       People should always be allowed to access all types of media, especially in librairies.  These media types help shape who each individual is and helps them to help make contributions to the world in their lives.  Though there wil;l always be bad media, we must understand even the bad in this world, so that hopefully people will make the choice to combat it.  We all certainly would not be the people we are @DATE1 without all the influences on us and by taking away even parts of knowledge we would end up only dehabilatating ourselves.   These choices all help us to hopefully advance and continue forward into the depths of understanding, so that knowledge will continue on forever",4,5
3967,"What is offensive? How do we know what offends people, I mean everyone is different, everyone has their own thoughts a beliefs. So how are we suppose to know what offends who?     The things that I would find offensive would be racial discrimination, gender discrimination, or religious discrimination. Those types of things would offend most people I think, but you can never be to sure.     Books will always be books though and you can not tell people what they can and can not write or publish, because everyone has the right to freedom of speech. People will always say what they want but not everyone can get what they want. People need to come to sence and understand that consept.     If a book, magazine, song, movie, or any other type of writen or vocal recording offends some one then do not read, listen to, or watch that item. No one can make some one watch or listen to something that offends them. People will always have a choice to do what they want in most cases.     Books, songs, movies, magazines, and many other things will always offend atleast one person in the world we live in, but to be honest do we really care if it offends people if that is how we feel or believe? So I believe that if it offends a person then they will not take it off the shelf and if they do then that is their own personal problem people can not tell others what they can or can not write or record, it is their life let them live it.",3,4
3865,"Katherine Paterson, who is an author, thought that if a book was not one that she would want her children to read that it should be taken off the shelf at the library. If you found a book in your public library offensive, would you want that book removed from your sight and public view? Personally, I wouldn't. I would not want the book to be removed because that book could be a good learning experience for others. In this essay, I will explain from my personal experience @CAPS5 I disagree with Katherine Paterson.     In the sixth grade, I learned about how to find a certain book in a public library using a system. We had to find certain books in our school library, using this system, as an assignment. One of the books we had to find was the @CAPS1 @CAPS2. I found it very easily because I knew where it should have been and what it looks like. But there was a child in my class who had never seen a @CAPS2 in her life. After helping her find the @CAPS2, she ask, '@CAPS5 is this book so important to people? I don't understand it.' I explained to her in the best of my ability the life of @CAPS6 and @CAPS5 this was important to me. She soon found out that it was something she wanted to learn more about.     It is against the law in some states that a @CAPS2 be in school at all. This is because of others beliefs or non-beliefs. If it were not for the library having the @CAPS2 on a shelf that girl would never have learned something that is now important to her. A book can be offensive to other people but that book can change a person's life forever. Katherine Paterson believed that some books should not be found in libraries. Unfortunatley, other people think this also. One book can change a person's life, what if that book was not in the library to change another?",4,4
3838,"All of us can think of or have this one book that we read and  hope none of our children or any other children have taken it off a shelf.Well at least I know I have a book like that, its called '@CAPS1'. I, myself personally feel that this book should be removed from the selves because for the simple fact it is over-rated and contains lots of violence and sex.      A while back when I was in the seventh grade, I read this book called,'@CAPS1'. I was a good book but it was also very explesive. The book was mainly about this teen who had a rough childhood and was trying to make it through high school while being engaged in a abusive relationship, peer pressure, and a adiction to sex and drug.      This book was exposing and very detailed, In which I strongly disagree with other children reading this book.  I feel sex and violence shouldn't displayed in books or any other type of media.      Inconclusion, I believe that certain materials such as books should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive. Books that display lots of sex and violence should be restricted and not able to leave the selves of libary unless their issued to someone eighteen or older",3,3
3951,"Imagine walking into a library where the shelves are empty. A library where there are no books to lose one's self in the pages. A library where we are not allowed to read controversial classics that fill and open our minds to new views. A library where works of literature such as @ORGANIZATION1, To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2, and @PERSON1 are not on the shelves awaiting students to dive into their pages. Some of the greatest books ever written are respected for their controversy and mind blowing ideas. Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice which is being taken over by modern technology.     A number of children in the @LOCATION1 are unable to read at their appropriate grade level. This number is greatly increasing due to poor education opportunities, lack of interest in education, and lack of resources in the @LOCATION1. Reading is the fundamental basis for each and every school subject. It is proven that children who are successful readers are five times more likely to be overall more successful students. However, by censoring what books are allowed in a classroom and library we are taking away a child's chance to broaden their minds. We are also taking away books that @MONTH1 interest a child. Children are @PERCENT1 more likely to read a book that they are interested in. Allowing a child not to read a book, such as '@CAPS3 @CAPS4' is unpractical and harmful to the child. By taking away a book that students greatly enjoy it discourages them from reading altogether. A person not only has the right to the best education one can receive, they also have the right to read whatever they want.     Books open up a child's mind to new places and adventures that they @MONTH1 not ever be able to experience in their lifetime. Books have the ability to broaden people's minds. Some of the most interesting and controversial books that challenge an individuals beliefs and thoughts are being taken off the shelves and no longer readily available to people. @LOCATION2 was founded on the basis of freedoms; freedom of speech, freedom of thought.  Why should this freedom not apply to books? Why should any person be allowed to tell another person what you can and can not read? And why should these books be available to everyone through public libraries? This freedom should apply to books. No one should be allowed to tell another person what they can and can not read. And these books should not be censored in public and school libraries. No one should be denied the chance to learn.  By censoring books in libraries throughout @LOCATION2, millions of children are being denied the chance to learn.     We live in a world where televisions, computers, iPods, and cell phones can be found in most homes and in everyone's hands. Books are thought of as 'a thing of the past' and not up to speed with today's technology.  However, books are an important part of one's education. Censoring libraries discourage kids to read even more than they already are discouraged to reading. Kids do not want to be told what they can and can not read and by taking away the books they want we are supressing their minds. Censoring will only make them want to read less, and play on the computer more. Censoring in libraries is also a pointless and non effective method. Kids with internet access can look up almost anything on their home computers. The things they find on the internet will be more controversial then the majority of books that are being censored. A favorite book of many kids is the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 series. These books have been taken out of many libraries for their use of witchcraft. However a child could go home and watch the movies or search the internet for something more controversial. Censoring is pointless because children have other ways of viewing things that would be censored in a library.    Censorship in libraries should not be applied because every person has the personal right to read whatever they like, has the right to broaden their minds, and has the right to enjoy a practice that is being taken over by modern technology. Today's youth is exposed to wars, terrorist attacks, gangs, domestic violence and drive bys everyday. The world of books can be an escape from the world they live in. Books can help a child overcome poverty, mental challenges, and violence everyday. The pages of books fill them with hope and give them courage to create a better future for themselves. The inspirational stories in books have inspired millions to achieve more then they thought possible. Censoring would take away the chances for our future generations to become inspired by these books. Censoring would only hurt our youth and the greatness that they can accomplish.",5,5
3454,"I do believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelf. They are certain books, music, movies, magazines that people find quite offensive. There could be a few books that have some aweful material in it. The pictures in magazines, on cd cases or on movie/dvd cases would have stuff that people @MONTH1 find really offensive. I have never actually seen anything like that before, but it does happen in schools all aroung the world. People might not get what certain materials want you to do, but they @MONTH1 get offended and tell someone about it. They would most likely to tell people to not get it and tell the school that they were offended by the material. Certain materials should be removed from the shelves.",2,2
4430,"Imagine your favorite book, song, and movie. The ones that you love to watch, listen to, or read a million times over. The ones that you keep on checking out from the library again and again because you love it so much. Now imagine it gone from the libraries. What happened to it? You think that it has been checked out, but later you find that it has been removed from the shelves because someone found it offensive. What can you do?         When you go to the library, you usually expect a huge selections of books and other materials to choose from. A library helps many people of all ages be able to choose whatever they are interested in. This is one reason why libraries are so popular among all people. If the libraries were to begin to remove items off of the shelves that they found offensive, many people would not be able to find all the items that they enjoyed anymore. I believe that everyone is entitled to their own opinions. Libraries should accomodate as many people as they are able. Removing material from the shelves @MONTH1 make some people happy, but it would also take away items that many people find enjoyable.     Libraries should not remove items from the shelves if they are found offensive. Doing this could result in less material for people of all ages. If you find something to be offensive, all that you have to do is not check the book or other material out. In Katherine Paterson's words, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on teh shelf for any of us.' I believe that if items were to be removed from the shelves, there would be less for others to enjoy.      Taking materials off of the shelves would be unfair to all readers. Everyone has a favorite book or movie that they love to read or watch. If someone were to disagree with this, this would not only disable you from reading or watching what you love, but it also takes away from other readers who didn't have a chance to make their own opinions on the material.      Many people have different ideas on what they feel is offensive. While some @MONTH1 think that some books have subjects too racy for readers, others @MONTH1 not feel that this is not the case. Take a popular childrens book like @LOCATION1's @CAPS1. To some, this @MONTH1 be one of the best books ever written. If someone disagreed with this and felt that it was too serious or offensive to young readers, many new readers would never know this book. They would have never had the chance to make their own opinions.      I feel that censorship in libraries is an extreme show of personal opinion. It is only natural to disagree with someone. You can always run into people that don't share the same feelings about certain types of music or movies. Eliminating material from the shelves would be unfair to people. If everyone were to take their least favorite book off of the shelves and replace it with one they like better, soon the libraries would be filled with items that would only reach out to a certain audience. Libraries are meant to fulfill everyone's desires and taste.      To conclude, taking items off the shelves because they are offensive to someone would not be fair. In fact, I believe that doing so would create more problems for people. If an item that someone was looking forward to checking out was no longer available due to censorship, many people @MONTH1 even decide that they don't want to go to the library anymore. What is great about the library is that you have a huge selection of items to choose from. If censorship were to take place, the library would no longer be a place to enjoy. Censoring material would be like telling a reader that their opinions were not as important as those of the people who found it offensive. I believe that if you find something so terribly offensive that you don't want it available to check out at the library, first think to yourself what you would do if the library didn't have your favorite things. Because after all, what you think is offensive @MONTH1 be the best thing in the world to someone else.",4,4
4470,"Yes I do believe that any book found offensive to any person should be removed from the book shelf. You have to think about it from the other person's perspective, or put yourself in their shoes. Say you went to the library and that certain thing was constantly there or it felt like it was constantly hanging over your head, that would be a tough problem to deal with in your every day visit to the library. Also  in your everyday life.      One reason for this is because if you find a book on a shelf and it offends you and another person knows it affends you then most likely they will use it against you to say mean and harsh things. Another reason i believe an offensive book should be removed from the shelf is because what if you are in that place very often. I mean if you have to see that book every day dont you think that would start to get on your nerves a little bit. So what I am trying to say is I do beleive if there is an offensive book on a shelf remove it.     Music should not be as much of an issue as books. Music is something you listen to or you hear. Books are things you read.     I say music should not be as big of an issue because music you do not see like you do books. Books is usally says it right there in black and white. Also the posibality of it being right there in front of you in words and a picture. So what I am saying here is that if you find something offensive then fix it instead of letting it bother you every day of you life. So get it fixed now or just get over what ever you find offensive",3,3
4552,"There is material out there that some people consider offensive and or have material in them that we don't want our youth to indulge in. Such items can include music, books, and movies, but I am just going to give you some of my thoughts on the issue.     On materials, like music and movies, there are ratings on the item saying what age is apropriate for the content that the music or movie have in them. Like movies there are ratings such as @CAPS1 which means that you should be @NUM1 or older to view it. @NUM2 which is parental guidance or @NUM3 and up. PG means you should have your parents with for the younger kids. And @CAPS2 which is for all age groups. If there is something offensive and or the language is bad in music the cover will have a lable that says explicit content.     I agree with this. I don't think that they should take anything off of the shelf unless completely nescessary. If someone doesn't like the content in that item they have the option to not listen, watch, or read it. There are people out there that might disagree with me and I can see where they are coming from too. Say if there is a book discriminating a race than I agree that it should be taken off the shelves.      There are also people out there who are more leanent and others that are more strict. Just like parents for example. A lot of parents want to raise there kids in an envirenment where there is no swearing and violence, while other parents let there kids watch and listen to items out of there age group. Like with me my parents let me watch, read, and listen to what I want and in my opinion I turned out just fine, while others might not thing so. I have seen kids that had parents that weren't strict and let them indulge in these items and they turned out to be well behaved adults. Then there are also people you had strict parents and they turned out to be not so good of a person, and vise versa.      That is about all I have to say on the topic. You have seen my views and what I believe. In a summary I guess I could say that everyone has there own opinions and views",3,3
4777,"Different Then Everyone Else     @CAPS1 do people find small things offensive?My opinion is the everyone as their own idea of what can be offensive to them.There are so many small things the can be offensive like books, movies, and music.Its not horrible or bad to have a book on the shelf the you might think its offensive. I find it a little rude to discriminate someone for thier one belonging.      Books can be a way to learned new things about someone. I think sometimes books can tell you more then what can a person with there own words can.There are so many books the can be a little offensive to people and even kids.I know the a parent wouldn't like to have a book on the shelf  about '@CAPS2', when they are getting @CAPS2.Sure is not a nice thing to read about but, really parents think about it.Don't you think us like kids need to know what really means @CAPS2?A book can tell us the and a good way or and a bad way but we can learned from it,and you dont even have to talk about it.      Movies are similar like books,in one way the you can see it in action what there trying to teach everyone.I know the some movies are horrible just like @CAPS3 @CAPS4.Its a horrible movie to watch but really we need to know what really happened to does people. And even it a teacher is tell you have to see it with your own eyes to belive it. A good way it to watch the movie and learned from it.      Music has  a lot of ways of being offensive to people but singer's thats their way of express their own feeling about stuff.We can't really discriminate anyone for their own belives. There are so many singer like @CAPS5 @CAPS6, the use a lot of bad words in his song but thats how he get's his own feeling out to others. Even if the song is offensive to you its more of their own opinion just like we all have different opinon then others.      My opinion about feeling offensive is we all are different and have a opinion about it and we need to respect the. Especially if i wanted to learned new things and someone doesn't want to tell me or show me I would want a book or a movie to learned. And parents just becuase I'm reading a book, or watching a movie or listening to music  about bad stuff don't assume I'm  going to do those things I would just want to learned about it. I wouldn't like for someone to take a book off the shelf especially if i want to read it. Remember its your own opinion about the book not everyone is different then you",3,3
4401,"Censorship, or the ability to control what is seen or heard, is a term that is taken very differently from one person to the next. Music, if it is found offensive or inappropriate, can be consored or even banned from listening. Some magazines that are found at grocery stores, libraries, and sometimes even airports, have @ORGANIZATION1 covers on the front to visually censor the front page of the magazine. Movies are given ratings based on their level of explicit material, and when shown on basic cable, they sometimes can have either silenced words, or more appropriate words brought in to fit the dialougue in the movie. Books, although very rarely, have been banned from libraries and censored from the entire world. Some books have been previously censored, but became uncensored and brought back to libraries. In my opinion, censorship should not be based on a single person's view of the material, but rather on the viewpoint of the public. Growing up, my parents would watch carefully about what shows I watched, what music I listened to, or the types of magazines that i looked at.     When I was growing up, I loved to watch professional wrestling. I loved to watch big scary guys as tall as seven feet hitting each other with steel chairs, crashing each other into tables, or throwing each other off of twenty-foot steel cages. My brother and I used to have a favorite wrestler that we would for every week, @PERSON1 @CAPS1 could freighten any other wrestler who stood in his way. My brother and I loved to watch @PERSON1 @CAPS1 compete every week for a chance at a world chamionship belt. As time passed, professional wrestling began to welcome in beautiful women into their business. These women would come out onto the ring with tight, shiny, lingerie on as they became eye-candy for the men who watched professional wrestling. One day, I'm watching two girls fighting in a match when my mom walks in. She takes one look at the half-naked girls fighting each other and turns off the @CAPS3 and declares that professional wrestling is too adult for me. Even though I was twelve at the time, I didn't want to get in an argument with my mom about how much I should be allowed to see. Censorship can be based on the ideas and viewpoints of the parents and guardians.     I was in grade school when I fell in love with the show, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6.' @CAPS7 is a show about four boys who go on unintentional adventures to save their @CAPS4 @CAPS5. These four boys, who are all around eleven years old, use curse words that some adults would be afraid to use in every day life. Their behavior is very controversial and the show itself has been forced to ban a few of their episodes for safety reasons. One problem with @CAPS7 show was that my dad loved @CAPS7 show as well, and tried to get my mom to like the show. When my mom saw the show, she immediately banned me from watching it because of its explicit content. Now that I am older, I am able to make my own decisions about what I watch, but as a kid, my parents decided what was appropriate for me.     I grew up listening to several different types of music. My brother listened to rap, alternative, and even songs that were in musicals because he was in show choir. My dad introduced me to classic rock, and my mom loved soft rock. Although I didn't necessarily like the music that my mom liked, I learned to love my dad's music and my brother's music. I loved to listen to music from artists like @ORGANIZATION4, @ORGANIZATION1, @LOCATION1, @ORGANIZATION3, @CAPS8, @CAPS9, and so on. My musical tastes branched out into a variety of different genres. One day, I'm walking in the hallway when I hear some music coming from the living room. I go to see what is playing because it sounds unfamiliar. My dad and my brother told me to go into another room and not listen to the music. The song was by a band named @ORGANIZATION2. Even though it might seem unfair, censorship, given by the parents and guardians, is very necessary.     Although some people might find a certain piece of material offensive, it doesn't mean that the entire world should be banned from the material itself. If that person wants to keep away from the material and keep their kids from seeing or listening to that material, they are able to do that. Censorship, given by the parents or guardians, is the best way to view censorship. Nothing should be banned from a library, music store, or any other place that sells these materials. Censorship is important, but the entire banning of a certain piece of material is unjust.",5,5
3069,"If you walk into a store and see a book you dont like or a magazine you could care less for, should you be able to get rid of it? My answer to that is no you should not. You do not own the libraries books and you do not have any say on what is displayed in any store. You are the viewers and buyers to these suppliers and if you dont like it dont buy it or look.     When I was in the eighth grade I went to @LOCATION2 for a church missions trip. There was alot of cool things there that I saw. This was one of the most popular places in the @LOCATION1. When we wouldn't be working or serving others we would walk around and do some shopping. There is alot of people in this city and it was packed all the time. Now with that being said there was alot of different stores and there are some in my opinion at the time that i thought were very inappropiate for my age level. My whole group walked into a store where we just really didnt belong and we all had no clue this was the kind of store this was. Our actions simply invovled nodding our heads good bye at the cashier and walking out continuing our day of shopping. We did not remove any books, pictures, or even magazines in that store. Reason being is that, that was their store and we had no right to remove anything. After we left there other people walked in that store and liked what they saw if we would have removed those items they wouldnt of got to see what they liked. That would be like someone removing something from a store I like meaning i'd never get to see it and I wouldn't want that.     If you walk in to a store and see something you do not like you shouldn't be able to try and get rid of that object. Whether you want your kids seeing it or not you just cant do it. You take your own risk walking into a store and seeing what they have in store for you.You are there to browse around or buy a few things if you would like too. Every store should have their own certain things and what you find offensive other people might like. That goes for the opposite too what other people find offensive you might like. It is all a big chain with many loops.      So say you do take that piece of material off that shelf or off the display. Now that material is gone all because of you thought it was offensive. Say another person walks in the ame store and takes something off the shelve that they thought was offensive. Now there is two things gone from the shelve, but you actually liked what they took off the shelve and your upset that they took that off. This will cause alot of conflict and big situations in the future if this was allowed. One person likes it one person doesnt. If you dont like what you see in a store then you shouldn't walk in or you should simply ignore the stuff that is offensive to you.     These are some of my opinions about this catagory. I believe you shouldn't be able to take stuff off shelves and terminate other stores products. Always be aware of what your getting your self into and know the outcome of the decisions you make. This could cause alot of lossed jobs and many conflicts between shoppers and viewers like you. I hope you take this into consideration and understand my reasonings for what I have said",4,3
4332,"The library is a public place. Everyone is allowed acces to the library. It supplies everyday people with information that they are seeking to learn about. There are so many different forms of information and entertainment offered inside libraries. Books, music, movies, etc, they all can be found there. Since they all can be found, censorship in libraries should not be allowed.     Genres were created for a reason. Certain items have different forms to them. There are many forms of music. Classical, rock, and blues are some examples. Since music is categorized in such a way, there should  be no need for them not to be on the shelves at a library. If a certain type of music or book is known to be offensive, then that certain genre can be avoided. There is no need to even visit a section of the library if one knows that he or she finds it offensive.     In the @CAPS1 the @CAPS2 people are given many rights that are often taken for granted. The freedom of speech is one. It is a privilege that if taken away would tear @CAPS3 a part. The freedom to say what you please also includes singing. Certain music that is on the shelves at a library does have the right to be there. Just because a certain group of individuals finds the type of music offensive, does not mean everyone also thinks that way. For this reason any genre of music can sit on the shelves at a library.     Another freedom given to the @CAPS2 people is the freedom of press. Anything put onto paper is legal. Criticizing the government or fantasising about school, it is all legal. Books can be offensive to many people. They can persuade one in ways that is unbelievable. Like music, books have many categories. Whatever is put inside those books is allowed to be there no matter what.     Movies are located at libraries as well. They are categorized just as much as books and music. The term ' @CAPS5 judge a book by it's cover' is true sometimes. This can also be used with movies. The title of a moive or book will tell what it is about. Certain movies that are not meant to be seen by children are rated @CAPS6 or @NUM1. These ratings help censor things to a certain extent. It is not illegal for a library to have a rated @CAPS6 movie. It is illegal however to check one out to a child of a young age.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries. All types of genres of all types of entertainment can be found in libraries. From books to videogames there are ratings and generes. If someone is offended by these types of entertainment they should not visit that section of the library. It is not illegal to have certain types of music, books, movies, etc inside a library. As long as no laws are being broken, there should be no problem.",4,4
3321,"Censorship, thats a word that causes alot of arguements in today's society. People have extremely different views on censorship throughout the world. In some countries dictators do @CAPS4 allow their citizens to have internet access watch the news or in some more extreme cases @CAPS4 even watch television at all. The majority of the time they do this because they do @CAPS4 want the citiznes of their country to know what is happening around the world. This sets up a 'fish bowl' environment meaning that people from other countries see all of the issues in that country but the people actually in the country have no idea whats going on around them.     Although we don't always see censorship in that extreme of a sense it is still plays a large part in today's society. Everything from music on the radio to military files are censored. Think about it, how often can you listen to a song on the radio that all of the original words are still intact? Arguements over censorships have gone back and forth for years without really making much prgress at all. Each side of the arguement whether its for or against censorship is almost entirely opinionative. No one can say for sure that censorship is completely needed or @CAPS4. It's just to hard to determine who's opinion is really, more convincing.     In my opinion I dont think anything should be consored, if the writer of a @CAPS1 show throws in a vulger word most likely it's for the effect that it has on people to show emotion. The samething goes for songs, when an artist writes the lyrics to a song they are trying to convey a message and they use certain words that get their point across more effectively or more dramatically. Parents argue that their children are seeing to much violence on @CAPS1 and are causing behavior problems along with other things, and that shows need to be more suiting for children. There is an alternative to censoring all of these things, rather than 'ruining' everyone's fun just dont let your kids watch that show.      In the @LOCATION1 today we have something called freedom, we exercise this right everyday with what we wear, and what we say. I think that we should take that freedom and apply it to censorship. Instead of complaining about violence in movies and sex on @CAPS1 you can make a decision simply to @CAPS4 watch that kind of show. Everyone has the option to say NO; if you dont want to hear or see something simply choose something else to watch, or even just do someting entirely different. You DO @CAPS4 have to do anything that you don't want to do. It's is an easy solution, all you have to do is exercise a right that you have had since the day you were born an just say no, I dont want to do that. It's very simple and could potentially stop all debates on whether or @CAPS4 things need to be consored.",4,4
4556,"I do not think libraries should have to censor the kinds of books, magazines, etc..., because people should have the right to read anything that want.      People do not necessairly like reading some things, but if it is important that they research something, or read a book for school then they need to have the resources availablet to them. Take the book, @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2, for example. In that book it describes kidnapping, and the rape of young girls. Certain classes would require you to read this book, even though noone would really want to read about that.      Some people have different tastes in movies. Personally, I prefer horror movies (but not gory) because they get me thinking about whats going to happen next. Some people like the really graphic and gory movies, and maybe if the libraries started taking movies like this off the shelf, it would be harder for those people to find them.              Certain people would find some things more offensive than other people. Who can say where it should stop? Movies that make fun or talk about religion would be offensive to the people in that religion, but people from other religions would be un-effected by it. Just imagine watching @CAPS3 and seeing someone talk about everything you believe in and joking around about it. It would really offend people, while othre people couldn't care less.      Basically, I think we have the right to read or watch whatever makes us happy, and if there is something out there that you do not want to see, you just have to ignore it and leave it alone. It should not be ruined for other people who would like to see it",4,4
3768,"In this persuation essay it will talk about the content of should we or shouldn't we remove all offensive books, music, movies, magazines of the shelf. In this essay everyone will agree with the content or be in the opposing side of the aurgument. In this essay it isn't the exception that this essay will disagree with some of the viewing audience; however, there are situations in which the audience can go with both sides.      To begin with, in the matter of the case should we or should we not remove offensive books,music, magazines, or movies from the library. I don't believe that all content should be remove for all to see. In some cases there are the exception, but in banding all material doesn't seem logic. In my point of view the removal of materials seems a little extreme; however putting the content in a higher shelf seems more pratical instead of removal all for good. Yes, it might be offensive but in this time period offensive movies, books, magazines, books, and so on are look as more comedial and not taken serious. For example, a really offensive show called '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' is a really offensive and people just see it as entertaining. This show can be offensive to everyone, but yet we still see it. In this show there is warning label stating only be seen to children @NUM1 and older. Parents are advice and to be acknowledge what their kids are seeing. It's not the creator of the content to be banned, yet it is the job as a parent to be mindful in what their kids are reading, watching, looking, or listening not them. In which case there there isn't away to be right in this subject. However the creators of the conent see it as a way to vent over their lifes, experiences, and what opticals they had to faceor just to make people laugh. They see it as a safe way to espress themselves. It might be offensive to you, but for some people that's there life. You might not like it or it @MONTH1 seem harsh for you, but that's real life.      Secondly there are always something that @MONTH1 offend you, but it doesn't seem logical to banned it. An example might be religion. A religion a person might be it might offend you. It doesn't mean if the religion offensive that it will get banned or be remove for everyone. Your religion @MONTH1 offend someone, but they deal with it and embrace the differnces. If your friends has a different religion it doesn't mean you will never talk to them ever again.      Thirdly, you might express yourself and there are going to be people out there that won't agree with you. You might create a book, a song, or a movie that will offend someone in a way. For example, the @CAPS3 series is offensive to some guys and girls. A disagrrement between two girls fighting over which charater is better for @CAPS4. There are always an opposing side. A @CAPS2 might be tried of hearing about @CAPS5 all of time and might find offensive when a girl @MONTH1 compare him to @CAPS6 or @PERSON1. Saying why can't boys be like them, but even then they don't remove @CAPS3 all together. For you it might seem the greatest movie ever, or the most terrible movie in the universe.      Fourthly, another example is a @CAPS8 show called, '@CAPS9 @CAPS10 @CAPS11 @CAPS12' (queen of the south) where a women that had nothing to begin with, yet ended up being the most wanted in some countries. Some people @MONTH1 seem that it might be cool to be just like her. It doesn't seem that people will go uot there and do what she does cause in the television show shows all of the consequences there are if you do what she did. This show is an example of what could happen if you become exactly like her. Some offensive material @MONTH1 teach a lesson and can pervent a person to do something that they @MONTH1 later regreat.     In conclusion, everything in our life offends us in some way. It doesn't matter what it is we deal with it and our life goes on. There is no way to see this, but one thing you enjoy maybe be offensive to others. It wouldn't seem fair to take something you enjoy just because it offended one person. So I belive that the libaries censorship isn't at risk. In my opinion everyone has the freedom to choose what they want to read, watch, or even listen to. And also have the choice to stop reading it, watching it, or listening to it",4,4
4170,"Today's books in are libraries are sometimes offensive. Yes, I know they are about thing that happen in history. Other books are not, some more than others. They are about killing, shooting, doing drugs,ect.      First, I don't want my children growing up thinking @CAPS2 okay to steal, do drugs, or anything of that sort. I'v seen books that have no meaning at all that should be in are libraries. The kids might think they are good books to read, I think other wise. Books that fourth graders read that have bad words in them.     Secondly, @CAPS1 are fun to read, i know they are. You have to look at it this way im of age to read those kind of books but, letting little kids read those books is not okay with me or other people. If it where up to me i would take some of the really bad books, music, movies, and magazines out. @CAPS2 not up to me, it takes more than one person to do that. It would'n be fair if it was all up to me because the person next to me might not think the way  i am.     Next, @CAPS2 okay to take a movie and watch it or even ask for some music to lesson to. As long as @CAPS2 okay to watch or lesson to. Im just saying what i think would be right. Not everone think's the same. People @CAPS3 @CAPS1 kids watch, and lesson to all kinds of music and movies. As long as @CAPS2 okay with the perant it should be okay.       Lastly, @CAPS3 kids be kids. Have them grow up the way they want to grow up. Yes, that might sound dumb to the next person but it sounds okay with me. At the end of the day you still get to teach them not to lesson or do that kind of stuff in the books.",3,2
3908,"'@CAPS1 - @CAPS2 or No?'     Katherine Paterson's quote about offensive books is completely true, and I @PERCENT1 agree with her. She's saying that if everyone had the right to remove a book they found offensive off of every shelf, there would be no more books for people in the world. There are most likely books that one person could find offensive, but others do not. What would the world have left if almost all books are taken off the shelf? I do not think that offensive materials such as books should be removed from shelves because not everybody could find them offensive and could be depriving people of their favorite subjects, I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book, and because there would not be books left in the world.     There are books about every single subject in the world. Some are about subjects we love and could read about for days. Others are about subjects that we hate or that just plain bore us. Though whatever the subject is, whether it be about the media, science fiction, romance, or anything else, there are different people in the world who love reading about different subjects. If a person had the right to remove a certain type of book from libraries and stores, say a romance book, because she found it offensive in some way and it was taken off the shelves, then a person who loved reading that book would be deprived from it because one person found it offensive. Just because on person finds a book offensive, doesn't mean everyone else in the world would too.      I've had my own experience with a supposedly offensive book. In my @CAPS3 class, we were assigned to read 'The @CAPS4 in the @CAPS5'. As we were reading the book I honestly thought it was a very interesting story. Though later with some research I found out that the book was banned in alot of schools all over the @LOCATION1. Teachers from those schools reported that there were some very subjective words and events in the book. I do agree that there was some bad language, but I don't think that's a reason to ban the book from schools. It's an awesome story that won a couple awards, and my class also enjoyed it. My experience with this proved another point that certain books should not be banned.     Just as @PERSON1 stated, if every person was given a right to ban certain books from libraries, there wouldn't be books left in the world for people to read. There are millions of people in the world. If every single person was able to ban one book in the @LOCATION1, what would we have left? There would probably be nothing left. If every book was gone from the @LOCATION1, what would kids in school be able to read? Kids would start reading at a slower rate, causing grades to drop. One little law change in @CAPS1 could cause great negative changes in the future.     There's always going to be people in the world who find certain books offensive. That's never going to change, but people also have the freedom and choice to stay away from the book they abhor. Unless you're a student in school, you don't have to read or look at a book you find offensive, and you can also try to keep your kids from reading whatever it is because if you want one book banned off of shelves, your depriving other people of books. So I say every library stays the way they are now, and keep every book they have for all kids and adults.",5,4
4058,"To who it @MONTH1 concern:     @CAPS1 you take away books because someone might find them offensive? Do you believe racism is a part of liturature? Libraries are considering removing books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from their inventory for censorship. They believe individuals might take offense to certain types of beliefs from the different variety of entertainment that they have in their library. These types of entertainment should not be aloud to be removed from public or private libraries.     In many libraries, their inventory is being stripped for censorship. This means that books, magazines, movies and music is being removed because some individuals might find it offensive. Individuals might disagree with certain beliefs concerning their lifestyle and what they believe.      Liturature can be described as art that an individual portrays it as in his/her own way. It has been in the world since man first learned to write to present day. This means it has been there wars, politics, art and slavery. All of these are a part of liturature, so liturature is history in it's own way.     Some say offensive material should be taken out of libraries. they might think that it should be removed from everywhere. It should not. It is a part of history. @CAPS1 you take away an era of history just because you find it offensive? I know I wouldn't. It tells us what was happening at that certain time. It tells us what was happening in that part of the world. It tells us what the opinions were of people at that time. Many people believe racism is wrong, but we shouldn't believe that no one thought it was right. Many people thought is was right. They might believe white skin is superior over dark skin, but we should respect their beliefs in return that they respect our's.     Liturature is important to society and how it works. Without it, we wouldnt be where we were today. Liturature should stay in the shelves of libraries where they belong. Personal opinions are a part of books, and we should respect that. @CAPS1 you want to be know for destroying an important part of history",4,4
3224,"Why is censorship important in libraries? Why should we care if there is censorship at all? I am here to tell you today my views and opinions on cenership at the library.     When you walk into a library I assume you would expect a public area where you can read books and check them out, but what happends when you browse through these books and you find something offensive? How do you act, and what should you do? In my opinion censorship is alright but only used when needed. Censorship protects childeren and young adults from viewing things that are adult eyes only such as horror books, offensive music, and in most cases pornography. Censorship in the library is an important role because anyone can go into a library and pick up any book, but when you have and adults only section for books, movies, music etc. it stops alot of people to having to worry about there kids seeing bad things. For instance, if tweleve year old @PERSON1 goes into a library and finds a video game with large amounts of violence in it he can check it out and play the game without his parents knowledge of the incident. With censorship we eliminate such problems.     Now like I stated before censorship is ok when needed, because censorship can get carried away as well. In reality, its the parents fault of why there kids do things also like letting there kids listen to music with heavy swearing or full access to a personal computer. Things like that are creating problems for parents as well as people around them. When I say censorship is ok when needed I mean people censor important information on the account of a event that has happend in the past. Another example, if your in ninth grade and you enter a library for a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 movie but its to graphic the student is stranded for a source and must gain access to a computer.     Now that you have my opinions and beleifs you can get a better understanding of what I mean. Censorship is a good thing but it can also be a bad one as well. I think that if censorship is controlled correctly it can become a powerful tool in any library, school, and even home. Censorship is at times out of control but maintained we can use it for many things and have a great community as well as country.     In essence, Censorship is ok to and extent and you should beleive this as well just because if you think long enough you too can see what I see.",3,3
4406,"Often we go to the library searching for a good book or magazine to read without actually knowing what books are available. In order to find a book that interests you, you have to explore by picking up the book and looking at the cover and reading its background. Sometimes we come across a book or magazine that is innapropriete for children, and wonder why that book is still on the shelf for anyone to pick up. I believe materials that are offensive to some people should be permitted from the public library.     To begin, the books selected to advertise on the shelves of a library are not restricted for a certain age level. Libraries are broken up into different sections on where to find a genre, but a young child @MONTH1 not be aware. I believe they're certain materials found in a library that should not be put out for the public. Perhaps you have a five year old child pick up a book about sex and drugs, this could lead the child to learn things they shouldn't know until they are older.      To continue, offensive books should not be put into libraries because they give that library a bad reputation. If someone were to come from out of town and the first thing they seen on the shelves of a library was a book with a naked body or drugs, they would immediately be taken back. Offensive types of books can include books you wouldn't want a first grader to see and also books about racial or religion. Certain people would take offense to a book that was against what they believed in. This could result in a huge confrontation.      Lastly, offensive books can include books about someone's opinion on a certain topic. If someone against the writer's opinion started to read the book, they would automatically be offended by what the writer was saying. There is never an agreement when two people have a different look on something.      To conclude, although some books are offensive to some people and not to others, we have to be aware of what @MONTH1 cause problems to certain people. I believe any book open about opinion, and books that would be 'x-rated' should not be kept in a public library. We could easily solve this problem by making a seperate place to hold these books so people will not take offense to it.",4,4
2987,"All authors write for a purpose, whether it be to teach, entertain, or persuade an audience.  No author writes something and says, 'I hope no one picks this off of the shelf!' So, if every author wants to express something through their writing, then why should we not let them be heard. We all have the freedom of speech, right? So, why not the freedom of writing? Libraries should not remove a book, music, movie, or magazine from the shelf just because they found it offensive.     Everyone will read a book that they don't like, its natural, but that doesn't mean that no one will like it. Authors write for an audience, but maybe you are not in that audience; so, it doesn't appeal to you and might even seem offensive. Not everyone believes in the same ideas. You could think about an issue one way and your neighbor think about it a totally different way. Like for instance, you're reading a book about a young girl that is going through many problems in her life. She has gotten into some really horrible situations. Some of these situations you read about are so awful that you wouldn't want anyone else to read it. But, did you ever think that maybe there's another girl that is or has gone through some of these same situations. Maybe this girl comes to a library and finds this book; suddenly she finds guidence in it. She finds something she can depend on in her life that she's never had before. She feels like she has a friend in this book that can handle the situations with her. So, would you really want to take that book off of the shelf and not let that girl ever find her guidence?      Situations happen like this all of the time. People find something special in what they read that other people might not find. When a librarian takes a book off of that shelf, an opportunity is forever gone. No one will ever be able to learn of what was to become of that writing and of those ideas. We all have a right to learn, to explore new ideas, and to expand our minds. No one should have the right to take that away",4,4
3786,"'Book or no Book?' Certain studies have shown that there are many people in this world that have many diffrent intrest. Wheather that be cars, boats, toys, or animals it shouldn't matter what the intrest is. I firmly beleive that a library should have books over tons of things. Just because one person might not agree with it doesn't mean that another should not be able to read or possible learn about it.      This is a on going debate nation wide and there is going to have to be a decision made fast!! There are to many people making enimies all over the world. I was asked to submit my opinion and i beleive that they should be allowed to check out any book that they want too. If the opposite person does not agree with the fact that those books are being checked outh then they don't have to watch it.      There are multiple solutions to the problem. The librarys could have diffrent sections for diffrent types of books or such as sorting them by class or hobbies. There could also be age limits so that kids don't get ahold of anyting that they shouldn't be watching or reading.That way the other people would never even have to see the books that he or she does not agree with.      Well i cant wait to see how the results turn out!! I also hope they people make the right vote. Im not saying that my vote is the only way, its just my opinion. Either way there will be angry people and people that will be bursting with joy. So @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 for letting me voice my opinion!",4,3
3985,"Dear Newspaper staff, @CAPS1 @CAPS2 is @PERSON1 I @CAPS3 to @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 I am in the @NUM1 grade. The reson for this letter is that I belive that certain material, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. Should be removed from the shelves if they are offensive. The reson why I think it should be done because kids know days minds be every where from pron to games to bad music etc.            In @CAPS7 books, magazines, movies, have things in it that shouldnt be in there. When kids get a hole of it they act like they anit never seen nothing like it. When they get on the computer they get on web sites that they know they are not suppossed to be on. If we didnt have these things we wouldnt have to worry about the loud music, the virus on the computer and the books being riped up. But know a days there are so much stuff people can do to get all of things.           If someone just removed all the things that are found offensive from the shelves. That would be so wonderful for everyone. If they leave all the materials out there its going to be more and more problmes. When they just take it off everything will be in grate shape",3,3
4259,"There are certain books , games , and music that you and I know that shouldn't be in the library or stores on the shelfs . One word that we should study , children . Children  are the future , everything that happens in the future will be because of them . Now , with that done and said ; I would like to explain , and point out why we as people of @ORGANIZATION1 should overcome together and take books , music , movies off the shelfs . Drugs , crime , violance, movies , and etc .  Rappers most of the time rap about female ,killing people , and etc. Its doesn't mean that they do it , but it reflects on majority of our children . Music is heard everyday @NUM1 hours throughout televison , radio , and i pods . Its take it to even an  different level with to male gender . Calling female out of there name treating them how they were tought through music.     If they not listening to it , they  for sure watching it .Alot of the  problems come from letting children watching the wrong rating movies . Rated @CAPS1 is want they our now letting children watch ,and buy . So now its giving then a greater chance of failling life . So now we at two stikes with this stuff that we allowing our children to pick up off a shelf .   #@NUM2 thing we let them pick up and grab  is video games . @PERCENT1 of our children play video games . While the same time as we cant stop them making them , I strongly belive we can prevent from letting children buy them at the age level .Most of the games based on sex , drugs , violances , and languages. At this point children our taking it very  serious , and strongly believing they can do the same . Which leading to death or jail . Drug use , school dropouts , and crime rates our highly because of these same video games children our getting off the shelf. Strongly influncing  them to  grown up fast , skip over the childhood life . So why can't we do it ? I don't understand why we can't do it , when we have the power to . It will help us out so much for everybody future . Crime rate will go down , test scores will aprove , and our future will be brighter . For our sake , and our children .",3,3
3220,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our chilren or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf.'( Paterson) Katherine Paterson believes that if she can take a book off the shelf that she doesn't like anyone can. That should be the right way, but I don't agree. I don't think people should be able to take a book off the shelf just because they find it offensive. They don't have to take the book.     I don't believe there should be censorship in libraries. If people find a book offensive they don't have to look at it or check it out. Other people might enjoy that book. Likeing a book is an opinion. For exmaple, if someone doesn't like your outfit you're probably not going to go and burn it or throw it away  because that is just that one persons opinion. That is how it goes with movies, books, music, and magazines. Everyone likes something different so their should be different books.      When you don't like a book I beleive the only time it would be right for you to take that book off the shelf would be if it was in your house. Then you can take that book off the shelf and throw it away or whatever you want to do with that book. If you had the whole town vote to get rid of a book and ninety-five percent voted to get rid of that book then I think it would be okay. You can't just think about yourself when it comes to public things, you need to think about the whole community.     I read an article about banning '@PERSON2' from schools, I didn't think that would be a good idea. '@PERSON2' was one of the top picked books by high school students. If parents didn't like their kids reading it they should have just told them not to read it. I don't think it's right for parents to just go in the school and say they didn't like that book and take it off the shelf. I t's not fair to other readers who enjoy reading '@PERSON2 @PERSON2'.     Choosing what book to read is your opinion so you don't have to read a book you dislike. People like all different books so it's not fair for them to not able to read the book they like just because other people don't like the book. What If someone didn't like a book that you loved? Would they just be able to take it off the shelf",3,4
4683,"Public libraries should be able to keep all sorts of content for all sorts of people.     I feel very strongly about my statement, because everyone in this world is different. Many people have different interests, religons, and customs. If we took out certain books, and music from the library, it would defeat the purpose of calling it the public library. But if we had different sections of books, music, etc., people would be able to find what they want/need more easily, and no one would have to worry about getting offended.      It would not be fair to anyone in this world if we took out certain books and materials because one person had got offended.",2,2
4718,"If I found a book that I thought was innapropiate for others to read, I would ask the librarian to check into to see what she thinks about the book(s). If she believed they were offensive, then she could remove the book(s) without any questions being asked. If she was in the middle on a book and didn't know whether she should remove, she could take a vote or tally on that book and then go from there to see if it did needed removed. The only way I would find a book to be offensive is if it had pictures that were not appropiate for people to look at and it also depends on how old you are. Another offensive object would be too many words that involved foul language and or racism.      If i found a movie that was offensive, I would just ask that it would be moved to a place that only mature adults should watch or some teenagers. My opinion can't remove an object from its place unless there were multiple complaints about the book or movie and ect. Some movies and books should be removed from shelves because younger kids get a hold of these movies ans watch them and then go out into the real world and do these bad actions that was on the film. For example, if the movie/book was about drugs, then some kids would think it was alright for them to do because they  saw it on tv. Some kids even get killed because they go out and try these dumb ideas they got from the book and or movie. But the parents also play a role by letting their kid watch these, I think if they would watch what their children do, then some of this won't happen.      Music is another big thing that is becoming more and more out of control with offensive subjects. There is more foul language in music as it progresses. @NUM1 years ago, it wasn't that bad, but it's getting worse. I think some music should be banned because of the violence and sexual content it describes on the music. Some of the music I listen to, I just want to run it over with my vehicle because the whole song was about drugs, sexual content and or violence. I don't even know why an artist would want to write a song about bad content because they know younger people will hear it. I think offensive music has an effect on the violence that actually occurs in today's society because there might be some racism. I'm not trying to blame the artists or say it their fault, but I think they should think twice about their songs before they release it so everyone can listen to it.     Everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but some things should not be on the shelves for our kids and children to listen to and or watch. I think there will be something done, but it will take time",4,3
4513,"In our great country we have many freedoms, one of these is the freedom to read, hear, and see what we want. We all have different views that go with this freedom such as what we watch on televison, what we read in our spare time, and what music we like to listen to. However, if we had the right to remove things we do not like we will ruin the enjoyment for others. This would eventually remove our freedom. Many authors, musicians, and directors have stated that this freedom is important for having an enjoyable and creative life.     We as individuals have different views on many things. Luckily our freedoms allow us to have these views without intefering with the views or ideas of others. If we removed the books, movies, magazines, etc., there would not be anything for anyone. Our libraries would be emptied, the classrooms would not have books, and the stores would not have anything. We should not have the right to remove what we think is innapropriate or does not follow our values or interests.     Even though the right of removing things sounds like a good idea, we should consider the thoughts and ideas of others. Consider a public library, it has books for children, teens and adults with individual preferences, and a school library with books for children and teens with their own preferences on what they like to read. If we allow this right then these libraries which allow individuality would not be able to exist. People would be unable to live up to their freedoms of individualty. Everyone should be allowed to be themselves.     Imagine what it would be like if we expanded this right to the foods that we buy. We all have different tastes of food that appal and satisfy us. The foods that we choose are a lot like the books we read, there are kinds we favor and others that we would just try to avoid. No one would have any food to eat at a restaurant, at school, or any where else not even at home. It would turn out to be a disaster.     We should not have this right because it would not be fair to any one. Our views @MONTH1 be different but we have similar needs. The freedom we have is a freedom of choice. If we do not find a certain book, movie, or magazine to be appropriate we should choose to allow others to have the chance to pick it up and see if it fits their values and interests. Other people will  allow this chance too. After all, aren't individuality and choice what made the freedoms we have @DATE1",4,4
4646,"The librarys are made for everyone, from childern to adults. There @MONTH1 be somethings that should not be in certian areas or even in the place at all.

Any age of childern can pick up a material that @MONTH1 contain eaither offensive/or just some things that they should not see.

3926,"There are alot of things that u can find in the libraies that you can find to be inapporite to some but not all people. if there was something that i was ofined by then i would ask them to pull it off the shelf. if u have somewhat of a project to do then go to the libarie to meet some friends and work on it there. If you need help to finding a book for your project ask the person at the desk where to find it. The libarie is here to help those that dont have a computer at home, they can go to the libarie and do there work there.

If that all libarie had all the same books  then they would have more people in and out getting the book they want to read. if there was little kids that want to read kid books then they should have a section for them.

There are tons and tons of books in all of the libarie so theres a good chance there something out there that someone will find they dont like and ask for it to be taking off the shelf. if they would get alot of people saying they are offenied by it then they would have to take it off.     There is also alot of magasins out there that some should be seen to little kids. if they get on that talks about drugs and some other things they could be offensive by that. all magasins should have some what of a rating on them. you would have to be older than @NUM3 years of age to get a pg-@NUM3 mag. some of the magasins should be for little kid that go there all the time and adult. they should have them divid into sections for little kids and adults.

3337,"Katherine Paterson, a well-known author, presents an idea with which I strongly agree.  She states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.  And then we have no books left on the shelf left for any of us.'  If everyone has the right to remove certain books that they find inappropriate, there @MONTH1 not be anything left for people to read.     Although it is a good thing for parents to have a voice and stand up for what they believe, books should not be banned.  Many people have different views on what is right and wrong.  Some @MONTH1 suggest that a certain book is obscene, while others @MONTH1 be offended by a different book.  If every parent had the right to get a book banned, there @MONTH1 come a time when no books meet the approval of the parent.     Some of these books present great learning opportunities to students.  Books often allow students to think in different, new ways.  They can learn from a new point of view.  Often times, a student can look at his or her own morals and values, which is a good thing.  If a teacher finds a book which they think is appropriate, parents should respect the decision of this teacher.  They @MONTH1 suggest another reading, or offer other ideas, but to go as far as getting the book completely removed is not right.     While removing books for reading @MONTH1 be going to far, things such as movies could go the other direction.  Personally, my parents would be horrified to see grotesque, inappropriate movies set out in broad daylight where everyone can look at them.  I think that this difference between books and movies is a simple thing: Books do not normally have an inappropriate cover, while bad movies often do.  Because of this, even the people who do not wish to view the movie are often forced to see images which they find disturbing.  If one was to walk past a book they did not intend to read, they do not have to be apalled at the cover as they pass.     Although parents care about the things their children read, books should not be banned.  Although other things @MONTH1 have affects on youth, books are a different story.  They allow one's self to dive deep into thought, to make observations, and to form opinions.  They are a key to growing, learning, and discovering.",4,4
4609,"Libraries are places of learning. Books, magazines, movies, and all types of media are placed there for the same specific purpose: to learn and explore. When we visit libraries, we expect to find the information that we came there looking for. Whether the topic is something as simple as wanting to learn about a type of flower or researching the infamous 'In @CAPS1 @CAPS2', we want the truth and information in its rawest form.      Materials should never be denied from the library. It always has some kind of value. Whether it be for cultural,spiritual, entertainment, or whatever kind of purpose, books can serve as a purpose for information and exploration into a new world. Books that are viewed as 'censored', are only being viewed from one standpoint. Another person might find this book exactly what they are looking for. If someone sees a book as 'offensive' they must step into another person's shoes and see where they are coming from; where this type of information @MONTH1 be helpful to someone else. Touchy issues such as the @CAPS3 or books to do with religion @MONTH1 be considered censored, but that's only concerning one group of people. What about the other percentage?     Now, don't get me wrong. I don't think that racy or graphic movies or magazines should be allowed into the library, but any type of material containing legitiment cultural, educational, entertaining, and others of the sort, purposes should ever be denied from the library. From working at a local library, I know that when people sign up to be a member of the library they sign an agreement that they know what kind of materials they can check out. So forth for agreeing with what they're allowing to let their children check out. If parents and guardians think that libraries are pushing censored content on their children, they should read the fine print! They are allowing their children to be exposed to this. And all 'this' is, is information and entertainment in the raw.      Libraries are created to allow an open access to information for anyone. These materials should include information on any topic the library can get in their possession. None should be denied. People rely on libraries as a source of knowledge, and we need to work to keep that source ever growing",4,4
4759,"Today in the media there are many things that can be found offensive. Movies, books, songs and magizines are a few examples of where someone might find something offensive. I believe that whatever is put into the media has a purpose.      If someone thinks that something is offensive I think that they should just take what they find offensive away from themselves and not take it away from everyone else also. When a song artist comes up with a song there is a reason for why they put what they do in their songs. Sometimes they do it to get a point across to the audience.      When someone finds a movie offensive there is a reason for why it is the way it is; it's to get a point across. If people find the movie offensive they just simply shouldn't subject themselves to it. If they don't watch the movie they won't have anything to be offended about.      Certain books in libraries are found offensive to some people just because they don't agree with what is in them. If there is something in a book that you don't agree with you don't just take the book off the shelf and throw it away. Other people might injoy reading that book. If the book is thrown away no one will have the chance to read it besides the person who threw it away.     I do not believe that media that is found offensive to some of the public shouyld be removed. Not everyone finds certain things offinsive in the media. Again, everything that is put onto the market and into the media has a purpose; it's purpose is to get a point across to others.",3,4
4653,"Is there enough censorship in our libraries? Have you ever came across a vulgar or offensive book in your library and hoped that no children had ever read it? Well that should never happen,  if a book or any other material is offensive then it should be put in a seperate area of the library where only adults can access it. Other than that section their should not be any offensive or vulgar materials that children or even early teenagers should be able to see.      Almost everyday children and teenagers have access to offensive and vulgar materials that could have terrible effects on them. Maybe if they do not see these offensive materials when they are young they will be less likely to use or engage in some of the things that they see or read. For example when teenagers read about people doing drugs that could influence them to engage in those type of activities as well. The materials might not have an effect right away but later on down the road it could have a giant effect on them.     The youth is what is going to be running this country when we are old. So we need to do our part and take offensive and vulgar materials out of the reach of our children and teenagers. I do not want my children to read some of the things that I read when I was young. That is why I believe their should be censorship in every library.",3,3
2982,"In life you have the 'offensive things'. The little stuff that gets under our skin and eats away at us.  No it is not easy to get over ,but these things will make you stronger. Sometimes there are books, magazines, music and movies  that offened us. The only reason why we get offensive is because the subject either reflects our personality, or our life. It's not the authors fault, they write what they feel and what is the truth.          Okay, so libraris are full of book's, movies, music, etc. You can't just take books off the shelves, just because they offened you. Other people @MONTH1 like the book you hate. There are more books in the library you can read.           Another reason people shouldn't remove offensive material out of the library; it will hurt whoevers' company got the book published and also the writters. Writters and publishers would lose so much money because the library sells' there books,magazines, movies. They make thousands of copies of thier product, which takes money. So to make thier money back ,they sell to thousands of book stores.           Must of the offensive material will open the worlds eye's. Everybody needs to see whats going on in the world. Books, newspapers tell the truth about a subject. Now the writters intent is'nt to hurt you but to help you. Why cant the world be more open?          I know in my own life i have read books that at first ,the book offended me. I would get so mad, i would put the book down and walk away. But then,my eyes would open and finaly it hit me.  The offensive part out of the book helped myself relives a new understanding. The views i used to have would be gone. It is strange how you finnaly open up, and your life changes.     Some people might even find this paper offensive. But if nobody is stepping on your toes, and getting under your skin you wont ever change. Offened is a word used lightly; yes, people use it a lot but do they really mean it. Some people need to use 'well this book bugs me'. Stop being about yourselves and get over it. Life is to short to worry and feel offended.      Every single book, magazine,movie and music needs to be left alone. Those materials @MONTH1 reflect other peoples life and help others with thiers'. Just read another book, or watch a different move. Please do not remove anything from the selves, because it will only do more damage",4,4
3605,"Censorship in Libraries     Censorship in libraries is a big problem in today's society, many people get angry at libraries and markets because of the items that they have on display for the common consumer. If the consumer walks into a library and is looking for a book to read. What if they come accross a book from the early @DATE1's? In these times there were lots of words used that are 'harmful' to our people today, but what most people dont understand is that, these words that are harmful had different meanings in that time in history. So when someone picks up a book and finds harmful or un-appropriate words or phrases in them, they instantly get the wrong idea about the book. And then, this small group of people who dont like this piece of literature, go agains the vast majority of people who really do understand the literature, and the feeling and dialect of the book. That is where i am going to explain to this small group of people, a few details that they should keep in mind when trying to rip a book off of the shelf and throwing it away.     When someone goes into a store or library and starts to look for a book, they @MONTH1 come accross a piece of literature that they dont completely agree with. When this person comes across this piece of literature, all they have to do is put it back on the shelf and move on. Nobody is forcing that person to read this book, so why make a big deal about it?  Because most people who make a big deal about some of the word usage in a book, dont quite understand the dialect of the book, or the time period the book was written in. If you do not understand the literature completely, then i ask that these people do not make a big scene out of it, and that they dont try to revoke the author's rights to have that piece of literature on the shelf.          Authors have just as many rights as we do. If they write literature. A poem, novel, or even a short story, these authors have the right to have it published and put on the shelf. So why would we not have the same rights? If we dont agree with some of the literature that are being placed in our society's schools, stores, and homes. Then we can write a novel, newspaper article, or even make a website about your topic. You can make web polls much more. This is a more indirect approach to removing a piece of literature. If you want to have a better chance of this book or novel to be removed from the shelves, you can use a poll or have people vote, to recieve other people's oppinions, and use these in your argument. If you have more than one oppinion on a subject, you @MONTH1 have a more likely chance of winning your argument. And this will cause a lot less chaos and attention to be drawn to yourself and others around you.     Another reason why i dont think that people should be able to choose what is on the shelves of libraries everywhere. I do not think that anybody from anywhere shoudl be able to come into a library and take a piece of literature off of the shelves forever. Because, in todays society, we have researchers going all of the time, and we have so many people working on different theories and laws. So if we take one important book off of the shelf, maybe a book written in the @DATE2's about evolution. And we get rid of all of these books, what will happen when we really need that information? These scientists @MONTH1 need that piece of literature to test a theory, and if that piece of literature is expelled from the shelves, then we could miss out on a large variety of major information that could help out someone in the future. So the more information we take off of the shelves, the less we will have in the future to help us will our problems.     So, now that i have told you all of my opinions on this subject, i hope that you will have a better view on the cencorship of libraries everywhere. And that maybe someday all books and pieces of literature will be able to remain on the shelves, being endlessly read by consumers",3,5
3291,"Should public libraries have to censor some of the books, movies, and music they have on display? In my opinion they shouldn't have to. We as people have the right to learn, read, and expand our minds in whatever way we see right for us. There are three main reasons as to why I feel 'offensive' pieces of writing, movies, and music should be allowed in public libraries. One reason as to why they should not is that people have been writing and expressing themselves throughout history; therefor, there are far too many pieces that we would have to get rid of in order to eliminate them all. The second reason is that people have different opinions as to what is 'offensive' and what is not. The third reason that will be elaborated on is that people will be exposed to whatever it is you try to hide, if not throught the art of music, movies, or books, then through the real world we live in.     Throughout history, man kind has been writing things down to document experiences, events, and ideas that have happend throughout history. With those expierences come profanity, sexuality, death, and abundant amounts of situations that the public eye might consider 'offensice'.  If you were to try and delete these pieces, one you would be destroying a big part of history, and two there are far too many books, movies, and music pieces that you would have to get rid of. In almost every form of art there is some remark to something negative. If you were to take them out, you would be left with very few, if any books.     The second reason is that poeple have different opinions on what is bad, and what is not. For example, I was going on a band trip with all the other band students, and on the way there we put on a movie. We ended up having to turn off the movie, because one parent found it inappropriate. While that parent didn't like it, other parents were upset we turned it off, because they saw nothing wrong with it. The same rules apply with books and music. It all depends on personal views as to it being 'offensive' or not.      The third reason is that poeple will expierence all of the things you are trying to hide. If you take it out of the library, one will hear about it on the news, on the radio, in a restraunt, in schools, just about anywhere they are. Taking out the pieces in the library, will be useless in the long run. For example, people want to take out a book called, 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1' because it uses the word 'nigger' in the story quite a few times. There are a lot of people that feel it is not appropriate enough to be taught in school. On top of that, they want to get rid of all the books that say 'nigger' and replace them with books that say 'slave' instead. In my opinion that would be a stupid thing to do, because it takes away the authentisity and effectiveness out of the book. In the book when they use the word it is very powerful and makes you think. If you replace it with 'slave' that statement or passage loses its power on its readers.     In conclusion, I strongly feel that libraries should not have to take out the 'offensive' books, music, or movies. If it does happen, we would be deleting part of our history and knowledge. With that if we do it, how will we know what books to take out, if everyone has a different opinion on what is 'offensive' and what is not. Finally, should we do this, it will not solve anything. People in today's society will still be mean, still do sexual things, people will still use harsh language, and people will still expierence 'offensive' actions. That is the society we live in and poeple will have to accept that fact. That is why I feel that we need to keep all of the 'offensive' pieces we have, that way the people reading them might be ready for the real world once it hits them.",5,5
4157,"I believe that libraries should not censor their literature, all of our media is a fountain of knowledge waiting to be discovered. No one should be able to decide what is appropriate for the public to know. The right to decide what is and is not appropriate for us should not be decided by libraries. That right should remain with every single person, so they can decide whats right for them.          Over the last thousands and thousands of years media has grown at an incredible rate through books, music, movies, and magazines. With all of this media we have learned many things that we use today from past trials and failures. Media is something that always is around and reminds us of our past mistakes, to ensure that they don't happen again. The great thing about all of the media we have today is that we haven't even learned everything that we can and will from it.     Some of our media @MONTH1 not be the most appropriate things ever, but we can still learn so much from it. It @MONTH1 make some people upset and if it does then they should stay away from it. It is not right to get rid of certain parts of media because what one person @MONTH1 find immoral and wrong someone else @MONTH1 be able to learn from it some how. If you are offended by some of the material thing you should avoid it, not get rid of it for everyone.           Our media is very powerful and should not be censored. Media has an unbelieveable impact on the world, so we should not try to hide some of it. We have not even seen half of what media can do",4,3
3304,"How would you like to read or listen to something disrespecting and calling you out of your name such as, '@CAPS1 did you say to me @CAPS2'? Would you want to keep things like that in your libraries? I would, I think anything that was hurtful, harmful, or offensive should be open to the public because it's a great way and opportunity to learn.                             Books, magazines, and music on slavery are things I think we as a people required to read are things we are required to have. Sure it might hurt, depress, or even aggrivate some people but it also fills you with knowledge on the past. For a person of any race this is a way to feel the pain and struggle of people before us. Despite the pain or irritation this is a type of learning I would welcome in libraries.                             Knowledge of suicide is also something I think should be available. Because some of our friends and family have either did or attempted suicide, and without knowing about it how can it be prevented. Books on the subject would provide help for those going throughout life with suicidal thoughts. Reading about past struggles or facts about it could give them tips or ideas on how to avoid suicide. I think we need literature on this because I feel enlightenment on the subject is the only way you can avoid it.                                                                      In conclusion, I think that all types of literature should be admitted and released to the public. I think this because all forms of literature offer a great opportunity to learn. I believe that only by reading the literature on past situations and  struggles can you avoid or overcome struggles you face or will face in your lifetime",3,4
3800,"In todays world there are so meny movies and books that it's hard to watch or read all of them. They all have different look and ideas. Every one in the world is not all going to like all of the same movies, books, and music we all have different testes. That is why I think it wouldn't be right to just take the books or movies off the shelf. I think they make so meny different types of ever thing becuse we do have different beliefes like relegen, class, and cultur.     Music, there is rock, rap, hip-hop, country, jazz, and the list goes on and on. And if you just take it of the shelf becuse someone somewhere thought it was offersive we would not have music or any thing like that. I don't really have to meny thing that I get offened by but I do know that I have seen some showes that were that way and some people I'm guessing thought was funny.     Books, there are meny different gerens in that too just like music so if it has a bad work, or a rude annicdout some people @MONTH1 not like it. Books are good to read. It would be bad if they were all gone. Then it would be hard to learn or teach anything. Take for an example The @CAPS1 is one of the most read books in the world and if they just took it off the shelf becuse some people don't believe in it so meny things would change and releges are not going to be the same in any way.          That is the way is going to be with it all and most people do take offens to that. The way i put it in my head is that if they don't like it they don't have to read, watch, or leasn to it. Every thing in all of these bisnisses is in taking a resk. Its all about how you look at books, movies, music, etc.       So I think that just taking it off the shelf would be a bad chose for this. That is why we have our own free will and and make the choes that you want to good or bad, right or wroung. You might not think about it much but thing like this do happen it might not be in your town but some where out there in the world it will be happening",3,3
3712,"Hello, I am writing to you today about my concerns about my views on the cencorship in a library.   First, I think some of the music they play and listen to can be a little graphic. I know some of the music that is being played can deprive the feelings of others. Music should have meaning and instead of blood and killing it should be about the better things in life.   Second, I would like to talk about some of the books libraries have. I think if they want adult type material they should have a section just for adults. reading sould be about what you like but it should also be about what you are able to read.    Next, I would like to talk about some of the inapropriate magazines that some libraries feature. Some magazines show off a little to much for some of the people that go to the library.Most magazines that are show are for adult and teen over a certain age.I believe they should make a section for each of the ages and age group.   Finally, I would like to get on some of the movies they let people check out. Libraies has a graphic selection of movies that are easily in the reach of young children. Children do not need to know about any of those types of things at all. Libraries need to learn more about there surroundings before they continue what they are doing.   In conclution, I believe that everyone has the right to a library I just feel everyone doesn't have a right to have everything libraries hold. Bad things create bad minds and we have to learn to stay above those influences.Libraries need to change some of there ways and there selections to make things more sucessful on thier behalf",3,3
3739,"Libraries in @LOCATION1     I am going to write a persuasive essay about what I think about some books and magazines that some people find offensive thing in the book. I dont think that just because it is offensive someone it should be taken off the shelf, because some people have different views over the book or magazine. So I am going to tell what I think over this subject.          I think if someone dose'nt like whats in the book they should just not read it or something, because some people might find it interesting. People just need to stop being so selfish and start thinking about others. For example the author of the book or magazine some how relates to them, and they probably made it so other people could relate to them also. Thats why I think people should not argue about taking books off the shelf and start thinking of others. Thats what I think about people trying to take the books off the shelf.     So whoever is reading this please take this in consideriation and relize that some people like different books than others. So don't start taking books off the shelf just because a few people find them offensive. So thats all I have to say about people that are trying to get them taken off the shelf because there offensive to them",2,3
4582,Books are to be read not taken off beacuse of what they say. That to me is stupid are childern live in world of war and fear everyday what is a damn book gonna change? Nothing there gonna hear the f word and see blood and gore. Would you rarther them see it for the first time in real life and not know what to do.      Music is one thing that can bring everybody together. So by are childern not being able to hear some of them lyrics then we are pushing them into being pussys. Maybe there just some real people teelling the truth that you dont want your kid to hear.     Movies are something that people love to watch come on we pay @MONEY1 to get onto see them sometimes. Are kids are gonna be better because there parnets didnt want them to see the new horror movie there gonna see in real life one day why not now?     Parnets your not doing us a favor by not letting us see the real world YOUR @CAPS1 US @CAPS2 because when we get into that sitituation in real life we arent gonna know what to do then were scewed.,3,3
4134,"As a place used to gain knowledge and wisdom, a library is a wonderful resource. Multiple variaties of books @MONTH1 be found at a local library from documantaries to science-fictoin or just fiction. The most amazing part of a library is the fact that one @MONTH1 choose what he or she reads. Yet if one man opposses the view in one book and believes a certain book should be removed from the library, then the freedom of choice is lost. The selection of reading should be open to every reader, and although some @MONTH1 disagree, heavy censorship of libraries is an unnecessary meassure that constricts the ability to gain knowlegde.     In today's society, many people differ in taste or genre. So much so, that at times it is hard to find a common ground in a large group setting. The library is a place where people @MONTH1 be able to enjoy their diferences, reading different types of books spread across many shelves. Yet if one person dilikes a book, their opinion should not influence the removal of the book due to their preference. Author Katherine Paterson made a wise remark on the idea of censorship saying, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor-- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books'(no pag.). If one person finds a work to be vulgar and believes it shuld be removed from the library, then what stops another person from removing a book that they dislike? If heavy censorship is allowed in libraries, then libraries will become diminished resources, only containing a few documents.      Still, censoring age specific materials is necessary in libraries. Allowing a child to read or watch a movie or book that is inapropriate, is an inexscusable action. Censoring books for children does not mean removal of said book though. Removing a book from the shelf of a library is just as wrong as allowing a child to read a book that is too mature for his or her age. Katherine Paterson stated, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none osf our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But... then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'(no pag.). The censoring of books in a library cannot lead to the removal of books that have shaped our society and ideas, even if it is to protect a child. A medium must be found between true censorship and opinionated removal of books, due to one's belifes. Doing so will not only help libraries but also society.     There are many different opinions in modern society and due to the differences in beliefs and ideas, at times people will disagree. Yet it is important that poeple agree on allowing each other to have a choice. A very important choice that each individual makes on a daily basis is what to read. Libraries allow for people to make their choices and help to expand one's knowledge in the process. Literature, whether it is found in a library or at one's home should never be cast out due to someone else's opinion. Censoring of libraris should be considered, but not at the exspence of knowledge. Libraries should not be censored.",4,3
4352,"There are many books out there that parents would not want there children reading. Some books have violence and crimes, others have love and romance. But it is not the best idea to use censorship in libraries. There are many books out there that might not be good for children to read, but it might help them make better choices in real life. Also, we can not forget about freedom of the press.     With freedom of the press anyone can write about anything they want. They can write about the good, the bad, violence, crimes, love, and romance. Everyone has there own way of writing and there own imagination. Without imagination what fiction would there be for children to read. There would be nothing to write about without imagination. With censorship, there would not be any books on the library shelves for children to read.     If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would not be any books to read because every book has something to censor. Wethear it is swearing, guns, killing, romance, or love. There is something in every book that in innapproperate for children to read. If the libraries were to censor the books on the shelves there would nothing left to read, and the intelligence of children would drop dramatically.     Children read for many reasons, like to expand there minds and to enter a world where the book takes place. But what children might not know is that reading also strengthens there vocabulary. When children read they learn many new words that are in that book. While they are reading the book opens there mind to much more then what they are used to and normally around everyday. When they are reading the children expand the minds and also helps them with everyday situations. This is why I do not believe that censorship in libraries is not a great idea.     If libraries censorship books and everything else on the shelves there would be nothing left for children at the libraries. They would be stuck reading books where they do not learn anything. They would read the same books over and over, they wouldnt learn anything new. There wouldnt be anything the could expand there minds with. That is something we certinly do not want for our community or anywhere for that matter",4,4
3409,"Should books, music and movies be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? Books, music and movies have a certain veiw set aside for the reader or veiwer at hand. If someone has a different veiw of the text then they should not even be reading or veiwing them but to have books that are great be taken off of the shelves because they represent different veiws to someone else is unreasonable. People should give these things a chance because sometimes the non-original things just don't work. To have movies band from the public because they are offencive is something that is something that is just a way to control what we see and what we here. Books, music and movies should not be taken from shelves for the fact that they teach us a lesson about life without it really happening to someone.     Books are a way that people can express themselves with out actually going out and hurting someone or something. Poetry for example gives the reader a feeling of what the writer was feeling when it was produced. Books that have political or social veiws on something should not be discriminated because someone does not like the side that they chose or the way that the author presents it to the the people. In novels just because someone uses profainty does not mean that there message is any less clear. Their message @MONTH1 be that profanity is used to offten or that the way that the next generation below them my turn for the worst but it is not used to harm.      Music is a way that people can express their emotions without taking it out on the people that have hurt them or the people that they have hurt themselves. When someone uses profanity in a song it is not specifically said at one person; it is used to say how bad they feel about what has happened to them that they need something to really show how they feel. Many people who hear these lyrics sang to them @MONTH1 beleive that the person is telling them that that really is how they feel when its just a verse. Music should not be taken away because it is just words and they should not hurt someone, especially when it is only a way to express.      In movies you see someone get shot, bruitlly murderd or attacked and its already a horrible thing because someone died or because someone did not have a fair life. This violance shown on the screens in homes, movie theaters and schools is shown to teach people what dangers are really out there; they are not shown to teach people other ways to severly injure another person although that is how people perseive them. Movies are about taking an idea and showing the world your idea; to show the world that this is what you are thinking and that this is how you feel about something.      To have this all taken away shows that the generations before us are scared of what it is that we can do when we are a whole or what we can be if we stand alone and say that we don't like something.  Books, music and movies that are all based on something that is real should not be banded just because they show individuallity; just because they have the deacensy to show us the truth in all the lies told to us but a higher person. These people most likely beleive that there is a thing as a perfect life when there is not one so when people show the way that things are they get scared that their ideas of a perfect thing are ruined by those who know the truth. The censorship of only things that are truely vile should be censored not the things that have nothing to do with the way that the comunities are today.",3,4
4193,"Do I think certain materials like books, music, movies, and magazines that might be offensive should be taken off the shelves in libraries? Of course not, there supprisingly still is such a thing called freedom of speech in this country. Just because some people @MONTH1 find something offensive does not mean that the so called offensive material does not have the right to be published or shared with anybody.     Think of some authors that wrote books like @PERSON1, although there were alot of racist remarks in literature of that time period. That does not mean that they still are not a part of american history. What would taking these types of books off the shelves accomplish? Absoulutely nothing is what, racist people arent going to go hey since all these racist books are gone im just going to except everyone now.     Music and movies are forms of expression aswell, and if someone wants to get out of hand write something offensive so be it. You do not have to listen the songs or watch these movies. Nobody can force you to do anything of that nature.     People just take everything so literally these days, they got to have their part in anything and everything. When they should reallize that most problems like these do not even pertain to them at all. That they should just focus on their lives and not worry about everything they hear in the news.",3,3
3494,"NO, I think books and ect. should be tooking down off selves if they are offensive! It's a free country and they have they will to freedom of speech. No one can think for nobody so everybody's going to have their opioin.

If we took down the books people said offened them we would'nt have any books left. Everyone has their own opioin about things and diffrent views. It's most likely that someones goin to get offened. In some cases it makes a person better at wat their doing to be offened. Some offensive things are part of @CAPS1 and shows how things progressed from back then to now. What's a child without it's @CAPS1?             Out of all the people who should be mad or think they should be offened is the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 ,but their not complaining about the books and etc. then no one should. You know jus as well as I know that most of the movies are about how we got whipped and sold back in slavery.Books about how only a couple of us made it. Magazines about how we sex and kill each other. Papper telling how are black communties are failing.                So in my opioin, no books should be tooken of the shelfs if there found offenisve. It was going on before we got here and when we leave it's still going to be going on. It's apart of @CAPS1 and there's no better way to find out about things if you don't see it yourself. People always saying kids should read more. What's to read if you take all the books down thats offensive?",2,3
3182,"There are many diffrent people in this world, who have many diffrent oppions about books, music, movies, magazines, etc., @CAPS1 because one person dose not perticualy like horor movies, that dose not mean that movies stores should remove horor films from there shelves. as creepy as it @MONTH1 sound. there are many people in the world who are slasher film freeks. the live and breath scarry movies. I myself like @CAPS1 about eveything out there. i will read any book of listen to any type of music, it actualy widens my taste in certain materials. i feel like everyone should try new things. Say growing up your favorite books were @CAPS2 The @CAPS3. and you would like to shaire your childhood stories with your children. BUT @CAPS4, books stores took @CAPS2 The @CAPS3 off of their shelves because a tiger and a pig could never be friends. This is nonsince. many people like many diffrent things.there is no reason to only sell what you like. otherwise your busines will fail.",2,2
3949,"The views on censorship in libraries definitely varies from person to person. There are those who are offended by the material that is out there for anyone to access, and then there are those who want the right to read, listen, and watch whatever they choose. I believe there are pros and cons to each choice, either way you look at it, but there does need to be some sort of censorship in libraries; the line must be drawn somewhere.     The lyrics in music can come off extremely offensive to some people. The inappropriate scenes in movies, whether it be involving two people of opposite sex or intense action moments, are not something people of a young age should be exposed to.     The easy access to the library is part of the problem. Someone of any age can get their hands on just about anything they want. In my own experience, I have had the opportunity to get whatever I wanted at the library. The advertising pictures on the cover of books, movies, magazines, etc., gave me a false sense of what the material really contained when I was younger. I came home from a day at the library with materials that my parents did not approve of.     If you look at it from the other point of view, you would probably be thinking, if we got rid of all material that someone would find offensive, our libraries would be left with close to nothing. In reality, I believe that once people realized that exposure to this kind of material is offensive, authors would change the way they would write; directors would change the way they produced movies; artists would change the lyrics to their songs. So yes, library's shelves would have been rid of many materials, but they would be replaced with what the people want.     Others might argue that they have the right to read, listen, and watch what they would like. This @MONTH1 be true, but shouldn't others have the right to let their children go to libraries without worrying about the gruesome material they might be exposed to?     Although to some people this argument @MONTH1 go either way, if the line is never drawn on what is available, who knows what the world @MONTH1 come to. From here, the material can only get more offensive, more disturbing, and leave a bigger effect on the minds of people. Children will be exposed to the 'evils' of this world at even a younger age, and if that is all they ever know, they won't realize what else this world has to offer them. Authors, directors, producers, and artists will all change their material if we show them that it is not what we want.",4,4
3402,"In the world, there are just some things that our children should not be exposed to. I believe that the media such as music, magazines, and movies set a high bar for the individuals in our society. I highly disagree with what the media feeds to our minds as to the way our looks and lifestyle should be.     The library is a place where most children go to feed their imaginations with colorful books with morals; but the library is also where adults go to free their minds of work and to escape many of life's responsibilities. Most children from ages @NUM1 to @NUM2 draw a curious mind to the very adult world and seek to find answers. Now the library is not a place where a child can recieve adult information right? Wrong! the library shelves are open to any and everyones advantage. A child can just as easily come across the wrong track to take ones innocence. Some parents in sociey believe that their neighborhood is a perfect harm free enviornment to raise children. Little do parents know, it is a very uncensored world and at anytime a child can learn of it's exsistance.     The media draws it's attention to captivate our children. We have to watch what we let our kids watch, listen to, and read. For example, the girl in the magazine who just recently got a nose job because her nose was too big is feeding the idea to your eight year old daughter. She believes that she can recieve surgery to fix her big nose that the kids at school tease her about. Maybe your son listens to rap or rock music that condones the use of violence, drug, and alcohol use. He will think its ok to pick fights at school with other children or curse the teacher. Or the movie with the sex scene in it could give your child the idea to go out and practice what was taught.     In our society, there should not be an image that our children should try and sustain. We should teach our children that life is better explored through @PERSON1's '@ORGANIZATION1' or through the wonderful adventures of 'The @CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION2'. Parents should feed kids 'imagination' and not feed their 'image'. Life for our children should be about fun, knowledge, and life experience; but not everything that is on the shelves of our local library.",4,4
3665,"Removal of Books      If there is a book that someone takes offensive, should every book similar to that book be taken of shelves?No, even though people @MONTH1 find things in books offensive, they should not remove the books off shelves.      When i was in the sixth grade my teacher asked me to read and write a summary on 'A @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3'. I searched the whole library for the book then finally decided to ask for help, the privilage to read the book has been taking away. The book was no longer allowed in elementry schools, due to the fact parents were seeing what their children were reading and found the book very offensive. After many reports about the book, the book was taken out of the library. For me to do as my teacher asked i had to go to a public library and get the book.        If you find a book offensive keep @CAPS3 to yourself and dont read the book, they shouldnt be able to remove books just because of what people think of them. Many people love different types of books, no matter if they are offensive or not others @MONTH1 like them.         I believe that everyone has a right to read anything they want, books are made to be read and looked at. If books are being taking away then very less books will be read. But the more books read and understood, more books will be wrote and published.          The same has to do with music, movies, magazines, ect, they all are made for a reason and should be checked out. @CAPS3 is great to learn about different things by reading, listening, reveiwing, ect, even the things people @MONTH1 find offensive, they @MONTH1 teach lessons.",3,4
4395,I think that your parents should have to sign a peice of paper saying that it is ok or its not ok for the person to go to that side of the library. It is up to the parents and the way there kids will handle it.     On one side of the library it would be more geared to a more mature audience no pornagraphic material of course but stuff that wouldnt be considered @NUM1. Kids fifteen and and older would understand. They might also have to have an adult with them.      On the other side of the library it would be more of a childrens area with child storys. It would be targeted for more kids that are fourteen years and younger would like.      There would have to be some one in the dividing line being shown the pass that says its ok or not. It would be a little difficult but it would satisfy both parties.     It is up to the parent to decide if it is ok for there children to read a certain content of language and description. The child must be at least @NUM2 in order to get a pass from the parent though.     I deffinately agree with Katherine Paterson eventually your kids will find out what all those things are. I would rather have my kids learn from a book and ask me then find it out on the streets where they could end up getting hurt or in trouble with the law. Or even going to a party and end up doing something that might kill them.,3,3
4197,"Opinion      I don't think they should be removed because in books tell you what it is about in the back. Movies tell you what it is rated. It is mom's or dad's fault. They are the one how allow us to read it, watch it, listen to it, or even play it. if they don't want us learn it then they should't even get for us and the reason they get it for us is because kids are spollied. they want every little thing in the world and the parants are buying it for them to make them happy.     The parants are not the only ones to blame. The kids are to blame to. They are the ones how want to go the rated @CAPS1 movies or get a rated @CAPS2 video games that have offensive language. kids also say offensive language to each other and suspect them to know what it means. The kids that heard the bad word will go to there parants and say 'what those that word mean'. It happen to me and I said those words to my parants.     When I fist read, heard, and watched it and told my parants what it means I got hit for saying that word. I thought to my self that they want to hear that from me. I was mad that i ever said that word I wished I can go back in time and never say that to my parants that. I don't know why I kept on saying it over and over. i just couldn't get it out of my head. I got in trouble by saying it just because I heard that stupid word that i wished never heard.       I heard it so many times I couldn't get out of my head it is like they knew what it ment but I knew they didn't know because they just said it randomly and I was preaty sure they didn't tell there parants because the one how told there parants got hit still woundering what it ment still having the red mark in there face thinking what they did wrong to deserve it. when I found out what it ment i never said it for a long time till someone got me so mad i started to say it again.     Now the two opinions still stands how should we blame the parants or the kids, should we take down the stuff that is offensive to us so the kids will learn the bad words? The choose is yours not mine beacuse it was mine i would blame the kids and no we shouldn't take it down stuff that has offensive language because for a lot of us we don't find it offensive to us or others. Just consider this 'what you decide people will be against it no matter what'",3,3
4583,"Nobody should believe that we have the choice to take books off the shelves of a library. America is a free country and we can write whatever we want. Everyone has freedom of speach, your just taking that admendment and putting it into music, books, or a movie. When you are looking for a book and you find one that seems offensive just put it back on the shelf and move on.     Everyone have seen a lot of things that are offensive to races and beliefs. You hear jokes that are offensive but that is all that it is a joke and it is not to be taken seriously. I have read a book recently called '@CAPS1's your @CAPS2' it was not what I thought it would be, so I just put it down and picked up a different book and kept on reading. If everybody were able to take books out of a library just because it was offensive would we have any books at all? Movies have a protection against this called ratings. The ratings are from '@CAPS3 to @CAPS4.' If the movie you watch is more towards the @CAPS4 section then it will have more offensive language and violent scenes. That is why there is always a blocked off section at a dvd rental store. That section is only for mature people of the ages @NUM1 or older. If by any chance your kid strays in there and finds somthing not suited for him and you really get fired up just think @CAPS1 let him wonder into that section. @CAPS1 should be watching him at all times, @CAPS1 is responsible for him?      I do not agree that reading material or anything in that matter should be taken off of a shelf. Thats like saying if someone did not like how the @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 was worded they could just take it down and throw it away. We would have nothing to read. So the next time you see something that is offensive just put it back and move on",3,3
4086,"Parents are responsible for their child, whether it's taking them to school, making sure their grades are up or even watching what their child reads. Libraries should not remove 'offensive' books, magazines, movies, etc. That is the parents reponsibility, it's the library's.      The library is a place to go when you want to get a book or a movie or a magazine, ect. Whether it's for enjoyment or research. That book was specifically placed in the library for someone to read. If we took out all the material in the library that some people, in there oppion, found offensive, then there wouldn't be very many books left in the library. Who is to choose if the books were offensive anyhow? If an adult or mature teenager went to the library to look for a book and it wasn't there because they took it off the shelves because parents couldn't watch their child pick out a book? Or even teach them that those books are wrong.      The parents have full responsibiliy if their child is reading something that is inapropriate in their eyes. How would the library know which books to take off the shelf because all parents have different ideas of what is right and wrong. If the kid is young, the parent would be the one taking their child to the library, so they could easily watch which book, magazine, or movie they're picking out. Most libraries have a children's section anyway.     It is not the library's responisbility to watch out for your child, it's the parents. Their job is to supply the community with books, movies, magazines, etc. Libraries should keep the books on the shelvles so people from all over can enjoy any book they would like to read.",3,3
4457,"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed.  People should have the choice to read or watch whatever they want to.  Just becuase one person finds a book offensive doesn't mean that another person will also find it offensive.  The libray's need to let the community deem what they find offensive or not.     Some parents say that they do not want bad or certain materials in the library becuase their children might read it.  If parents are that concerned about what their children see, then  they should sit down with their child and discuss why they should not be able to read or watch that type of material.  Parents should be able to make their children understand why they shouldn't read or watch the certain material instead of accusing the library's themselves just for having the material.       If some books or movies are deemed very offensive by public, then they should be placed in a special area.  This special area should be clearly marked with a sign that says '@CAPS1 content' and should only be able to be viewed by adults.  This would solve many problems such as children being able to check out certain materials.  Doing this would grant the people who wish to see this type of material access to the material.  This would also solve a problem becuase it would be in a back corner or area that not many people go to so children will not very easily see it.       The best solution to this problem would still allow the library's to put certain material that are found offensive in their library's.  But instead put age restrictions to being able to check out the material and also putting it in a differnet section of the library than the normal material",3,4
4561,"I believe if i worked at a library , if I found multiple idems that  has profanity, rasicm, slang.I agree with taking Magazines, @CAPS1, Music books, @CAPS2 books ,etc., I wouldnt want my own children going to the library and finding books with racism, etc.I would like to inspire more people to check out library books but you could'nt if there were inappropriate books .     If i worked at a library and I had to scan all the books to make sure the books were okay for young adults, young children to check out. How would it make you feel if I didnt do a book scan to check the books and one of your children brought home a inappropriate book how would you respond to it?    I would do a observation on all the books that we had in our library. I also think that all libraries should have more inspireing books and cartooon , and baby books for little children. I think if majority of us all went to the library and we found a bad book I think we should have the right to remove it from the shelf, not only I would'nt want my children to see i woul'nt want someone elses children to see. This is how i feel if my child picked up a bad vulnerable book.I would'nt let he/or she go back to the library until they organized there library.     Lastly I think librarys should have a big room full of little kids books. Also i think they should have different age groups like one room for baby books another room for @NUM1 to @NUM2 year olds and on up. I hope this inspires you .Always read the back of a book before checking it out of the library because you never know what the books going to be about",3,2
3817,"Dear editor,     I feel that we should not take any movies, books, and music off the self. I mean realy it will start confliced.Then we have law suight.

4766,"In todays world, children are exposed to a lot of inappropriate things than in recent times. They hear things from older siblings, see uncensored programs on television, hear words in music, and even learn things from books. An issue at hand is whether or not libraries should or should not dispose of inappropriate books, movies, music, and magazines. Children can read whatever they like if their parents give permission, but in today's society some parents do not take the time to care, consumed in their work.     One way society can take care of this problem is setting age limits on books. There have been times when my mother will not allow me to read a book because it dealt with issues that I was not ready to learn about. Although I am lucky that my mother cares about what I read, some parents are not. This is why an age limit would be helpful in keeping our youth modest. The librarians, or a national book association, could decide if the content of a book is appropriate for a certain age. This would take care of children reading about bawdy issues that they should not know about. Also, @CAPS1 books should be more readily available. These types of books teach good morals and how to live a good and full life. In schools across the country, many @CAPS1 authors are not in the public school libraries. By putting these types of books into the libraries, students would be more aware of them and would most likely have an interest in them, learning from them.      Another issue libraries have is music and movies. It is nice to be able to go to the library and check out a cd or even a movie. But, some of these have terrible language and scenes not appropriate for children. What can the general public do about this? Well, demand that all music and videos with content not generalized for children be removed from the libraries. This would keep children from seeing and hearing actions they should not copy. There are ratings on movies for a reason, so why not use them. Anything above @NUM1 should be a definent no in libraries. If the movie has content that any child under thirteen should not see, then the movie should be out.     Magazines also offer a source of learning. Some are very educational, and give the students ideas to go and come up with a new invention or a way to help others. But, some have content that are not suited for children. Thus, like the books, the magazines should also have ratings. The magazine @CAPS3, for example, has articles that are to bawdy for students to read. Magazines like this should be put in an adult section where students cannot look at them. Magazines also offer pictures that, in recent times, would have been illegal to put out. But, in today's standards, they are fine to put in magazines. These magazines should not even be allowed in the libraries across our nation.     America's standards on what is okay to read, look at, watch, and listen to have changed drastically. Children are learning things they should not know about, until an older age, at a very young age. Society need to put strict restrictions on what is right and what is not for children. I personally believe that there should be very strict restrictions on what children are allowed to watch, read, and listen to. My parents were very strict about this and, in the end, I feel this has benefitted my learning process. Also, I feel the libraries should rid of books that, in olden times, would have been a shame to read. Parents today are not as in sync with what their children do as they were in recent years. So, society needs to put a strict rule on what libraries carry and what they do not.",5,4
3258,"Library @CAPS1:                                    @CAPS2 or bad?      It is a very rare occasion that i go to the library, i'm a typical guy, i like sports, video games, and hanging with my friends. When im not in school i try to stay away from everything that reminds me of it, like libraries. Those very rare occasions when i do go to the library, for a summer reading book for school, i usually browse around to see what they have on the shelves. Some of the stuff i see at libraries catches my eye, and not because it looks like a @CAPS2 book, but because it's shocking to see what they allow to be even put on the shelves.     On the book shelves that i have walked by i have seen romance novels and they arent as bad as i would have thought, at first they catch my eye with the titles because they are usually kind of out of the ordinary. I feel that these books aren't innapropriate for young adults, but younger kids and pre teens should'nt be reading them. So as long as there is seperation between the kids section and adult section then i think it is completely okay to have romance novels and any other graphic novels up on the shelves because they are types if literature.     Now magazines on the other hand can be taken either way. Gossip magaziines can be entertaining, but they can also be highly offensive. The problem with magazines alot of the writing is people's opinions and they could be talking in a very negative wasy about some people or some things. I think its up to the library to make a decision on that but if someone complains about it i think the library should be kind enough to take it off of the shelf. They are also magazines that show off models in swimsuits and clothes, and i feel that if the guys or girls are nude at all in the magazine they should either be in a back room and have people request to see them or they shouldn't be in the library at all. I've seen parents walk into a library and their son asked them why that magazine had a half naked lady on it and i just felt like it was highly irresponsible for the library to just leave these magazines out for kids to see them and then bug there parents all day about what they saw at the library.     Music and movies are not that hard to control from them getting into the wrong hands. Now a days @CAPS3 cases for music have stickers on them that say parental advisory, so i feel that the library should be able to have any types of music on the shelves because music now has warnings on the cases. Movies are the same way, they have ratings. If the librarian see's a @NUM1 year old kid trying to check out a rated @CAPS4 movie then she should be fired, because there is cleary no reason why she would do that. Excuses cant come into play here because if you look at the rating and then you look at the person you can usually see if the movie is appropriate for them or not. Now @CAPS5 movies should not be in libraries at all, libraries are supposed to be a place to get something nice to read or listen to. Pornography in a library is like haveing strippers in school, it is just not ethical.      In conclusion i feel that cencorship in libraries is a @CAPS2 thing to have. If libraries organize things well and make sure kids aren't in ares that they shouldn't be then everything should be fine",4,4
3214,"Censorship in the world we live in today is a very interesting concept. With the advent of social media, we now have thriving communities of people that want their voice to be heard, and people are listening. We now are able to tap into the huge ammount of knowledge from people all around the world, allowing us to see what is really happening in the countries like @LOCATION2, where media is considered treason. What do we do now that governments are starting to censor the internet? Lets start by looking an arguement that has been long talked about: library censorship.     Today, it is almost a requirement for cities to have public libraries to be considered as real cities. Public libaries, and the funding they require, are not anywhere within the @ORGANIZATION1. Even so, they have taken a place in our neighborhoods that has made them indefinate sources of knowledge and culture. One public library @MONTH1 be a source of; historical town records, children's books, novels, research papers, non-fiction books, fiction books, magazines, and many other types of entertainment and knowledge. Public libraries are, even with the widespread usage of the internet, important places for us, as residents of a city, to socialize and learn.     Libraries today @MONTH1 carry books that were in the past on the 'banned books' list, but that does not mean books are not being banned from libraries. Libaries are generally family institutions, and as being funded by the public, required to adhear by the moral and ethical standards of those who live in the area. This means that there is not one, 'national banned books list', but there many discrepencies througout @LOCATION1 in banning books. As culture moves more and more into more and more questionable materials, libaries are faced with a tough decision; keep up with the times and have more questionable and controversial reading material, or get lost in the past and try to kling onto the senior generation to stay alive.     Bringing new literary materials into the library that is fresh and new means that more people will return to the library again, be it young-adults or older adults trying to get in touch with the current world. One major controversy of books in public libaries are the inclusion of sexual intimacy. As a new generation sprouts, fed with music lyrics by such names as; '@ORGANIZATION2', or '@ORGANIZATION3', we enter a new age where younger and younger kids are learning about sex. The authors of today have recognised this and have started to include references to sexual intimacy, but not detailed encoutners. I believe this is fine, because as we move on in generations we are going to find out that education about sex; safe sex, birth control, @CAPS1 prevention and testing, is much more important than trying to keep children ignorant. Keeping these young adults involved in books and trying to continue their learning outside of school is a much larger issue we should be trying to tackle instead of trying to create silly arguments against new reading material in a public libary.     Public libaries are the centerpiece for learning outside of school in many communities, small and large. Knowing this, how could anyone truly believe that it would be smart to stop including new books that would entice new patrons? Even as a commercial buisness, this would make no sense, simply turning people away because you have a single view of what the future is and you refuse to listen to anyone else's opinion of the future. So why is there a question on including new knowledge? Isn't it obivous that we, as a nation, should show the world that we aren't living in the past. That we are indeed the future of the world, and that our young-adults will recieve the best education in the world by not only learning in schools, but by being the most active readers, and by extension, learners in the world.",4,5
3386,"Have you ever imagined a @CAPS1 without movies or music to entertain you? A @CAPS1 that has no books to read or magazines to inform you upon the latest gossip and fashion? Well, if items are banned from being seen or read then there will be no creativity in the @CAPS1, there will soon be no books or magazines to read, no music to listen too, and no movies to watch, and you will not be able to express yourself or your opinions. I do not believe that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.     If the @CAPS1 is left without certain materials there will be no creativity. Everyone will be forced to think the same thoughts if they can't learn about other thoughts that are protrayed to be offensive. No one can read about a topic that they are interested in if it is banned, this will cease creative thinking by not allowing people to think differently.     In the process of deciding what books are offensive and which are not offensive, all books will eventually be eliminated. Certain topics aren't liked by everyone and, as Katherine Paterson says, '...if I have the right to remove that book... so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Paterson is exactly right too; if one person has the right to remove a book, so does everyone and this will cause everyone to take off that book that they dislike so much. Also, everyone likes different kinds of books and different topics, and this will cause less self expression because if someone doesn't like books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because they think it is offensive to @CAPS4, then there will be no books about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 on the shelves for anyone to learn about it.     Everyone will turn out to be the same if they can't express themselves or their opinions. If a certain topic is banned for being discovered as a offensive topic then this will result in the thought being banned. If you can't read or watch a topic you shouldn't be able to think or talk of the topic either because you will offend someone. Also, if people can pick what books can be in a library, that will eventually be transferred over into other areas, such as clothing, food, thoughts, etc.. Eventually everyone will be wearing the same clothes, eating the same food, and thinking the same thoughts.     I do not believe that certain materials should be exterminated from the shelves if they are found offensive. If specific materials are banned: creativity will be eliminated from our lives, eventually all materials will be banned, and we will all be the same by the lack of self expression. If you haven't ever thought about a @CAPS1 without books, moves, music or magazines; I hope you have learned how crule and boring the @CAPS1 would be without all of those materials.",4,4
4507,"WE ALL DON'T THINK OF ANYTHING WHEN YOUR CHILDREN CHECK OUT BOOKS FROM THE LIBRARIES.

WE NEED TO MAKE SURE OUR CHILDREN BE MORE CONVINCED ABOUT THIS TOPIC.",2,2
4433,"Be a parent or responsible child  if you are against censorship. Censorship is really unavoidable, and it should not be an issue. If you dont want to read the magazine, book or watch the movie then just dont watch it. Myriads amount of people avoid it every day if they dont want to see it, and many people do read and watch those bad types of movies. It is a personal choice and you dont have to be exposed to it if you dont want to. Those who are against censorship try some ways of keeping your children away from the bad or yourself, but dont try to remove it completly.      One reason for censorship is because it provides hordes of information and expands your mind in different ways. The material or bad material you get out of it is your choice to read. but i think some of it is good for kids not so that they can be corrupted. It is so the kids can expand there imagination as well. However i do think children should wait until they are of certain age to read or watch this material until they are mature enough to seperate reality from fiction. Also it teaches good @CAPS1 that you might not have learned anywhere else. Numerous of these articles are about real life and what is going on today. I think it is great for kids and adults to know what is going on in the world. If you leave kids in darkness then you leave them with no right of an oponion. Any parent can tell there child that something is bad for them, but you can never really know unless you experience it for themselves. The can make up there own minds, and usually they do what is best.     Another reason for censorship is that it can be an escape for some people. There are people who enjoy reading about fiction or tacky things in life. It keeps them going on a regular day basis. You never know what somebody enjoys doing. If somebody is having a bad day and they want to read or watch what they like and find out they are unable now there is a good chance poeple will be furious. If i was unable to do what I like to do i would probably be angry or depressed. It is not alway a ferocious topic. If you want to keep your children sheltered from it then fine, but the people who can handle it dont want it to be out of public access. Also keep it in libraries because if you dont want it dont give your kids library passes. However if  you do,  supervise them while they are there. It costs money to go out and buy books when you can just borrow them from the library. People who dont have money or dont want to own the books shouldnt have to go pay for them when it can be kept from whoever it needs to be kept from.     The last reason for Censorship is it keeps people interested. It also teaches oodles of information. Not only does it entertain, but also there is so much vocab you pick up on from these books. I have personally learned most of my @CAPS1 from books, and i hardly had to pay for any of them. When you dont have the money to guy buy all the books you want the library has the same information for you, but its just more availiable rather than going to the store. Whoever finds it offensive thats fine. There is nobody forcing you to take these items off of the shelves, and its not there business what other people see either. If people really want to read these items they are going to one way or another banning them from one place is not going to remove censorship from our world. Children are already exposed to this in school and on telivision. They need to learn more than just appropriate material if they want to understand the real world.Censorship is viewed as good, bad, and neutral. Nobody is forcing you to view it, but on the other hand nobody can force you to stay away from it. Let people make there own decisions. If you keep complaining there will be numerous amounts of complaints right back at you. Censhorship should be taken as 'sticks and stones will break my bones , but words will never hurt me'. With that being said dont avoid the inevitable.",4,4
4340,"Censorship for the future kids of america.    Personally i have read some disturbing books also watched some grotesque and twisted, disturbing rated @CAPS1 movies. Not even talking about all the messed up music ive heard so far in my lifetime.    What it comes down to is alot of the music today is about sex, drugs, money, and violent crimes and gangs. The movies have a rating system which helps out for little kids. Books any one can get from a public library and some are about murder, rape, gang, violence, and all the horrable reality of the devilsh deeds in the world.    I personally dont have a kid but if i had a kid and he read a book that was bad or heard a dirty song with some of those lyrics and if he watched a rated @CAPS1 movie i would wanna file a complaint because thats not how i want my kid growing up. With a twisted mind and a vocabulary of a little punk with curse words every ten seconds coming out his mouth. Also i would'nt want my kid kissing his mom with that kind of stuff coming out his mouth.    But the @ORGANIZATION1 needs to keep all that stuff away from kids until there old enough to go get it on there own like they need to be @NUM1 to go see a rated @CAPS1 movie. That is how it should have always been.",3,3
3913,"@CAPS4 I think all books,music,movies,magazines,etc. should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. The reason I say this is because what if their are little children that are willing too read grown up books and its all types of naked pictures and words thats not in a child vocabulary. Then they will pic up bad habbits and then use them with knowing what the words actually means.  Then, I think music should be edited because somer music has cursing and talking about things that a young minded child or children shouldn't hear. The music should only be something children are suppose too listen too things that are in their age group.    Next, I believe movies should be censored because now a days we are letting are children watch every and anything they want too. Things that doesnt control their language such as(@CAPS1 @CAPS2). I believe that @CAPS3 sahow needs too be blocked because they really do and say exclusive things on that show, and alot of childern watch and repeat every thing they hear and see of that show. Finally, magazines...I say @CAPS4 too magazines because they have neaked girls and men on the covers and pages of these magazines that shows just way too much and they put things in the magazines too them look real when they are actually not. I think that etc.. should only be used when needed too research and do homework because children use enternet too watch exclusive things and listen too such bad things.    Inconclusion, All together I think it should be an limit too everything we listen too and watch. Because children pick up everything they hear and see",3,4
3573,"In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Items should not be removed from the shelves just because someone takes offense to it.  Everyone has a book or movie out there that they disagree with, but if it is removed just for that reason then there would be a very limited selection left.  Students would take advantage of this and they would have educational books removed.     Removing items from shelves removes history.  Our history books tell us stories of slavery and descrimination.  If someone takes offense to this and has it removed then we are losing a part of our history that needs to be heard and taught so that it does not occur again.  Items in the library are items that you can choose to check out or choose to not check out.  If you take offense to an item in the library then you do not have to read it.  Something that you @MONTH1 take as offensive @MONTH1 be something that inspires and encourages someone else.  Wether you like an item or dislike it is a matter of your own personal opinion and decisions should not be made based on someones opinion alone.    Think about it.  If you have a favorite book, movie, or song then would you want it to be gotten rid of based on someones opinion?  You have the right to be able to read,watch, or listen to whatever you want.  It should not be limited based on someone elses opinion.  It would cause much argument among people.  Some have different opinions then others on a certain item in the library which will lead to argument and possible violence.     There are so many wonderful and inspiring books and movies out there and there is always going to be someone who does not like at least one of them.  If items are removed based on someones opinion then there will be a very limited selection left.  People read for enjoyment and knowledge.  They deserve to have a wide selction to choose from.     In our society today there is always going to be something that someone disagrees with or dislikes.  Our opinions should not be based on a person's dislike of something.  If they take offense to it then they have the right to ignore it.  There are so many books and movies out there that teach us of life before our generation.  We need these books and movies so that there are not repeat events of all of the rough times our ancestors had to go through.  We need these books for future generations so that we are able to teach and guide them.  Items should not be removed from the shelves based on the fact that someone takes offense to it.",4,4
3147,IN MY OPINION I THINK THAT SOME BOOKS PROBABLY SHOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE SHELVES IF SOME OF THE BOOKS AREW FOUND OFFENSIVE. SOME OF THE MOVIES AND BOOKS PEOPLE FIND OFFENSIVE CAN BE PRETTY BAD AND SAY NASTY THINGS AND STUFF LIKE THAT.      SOME MUSIC CAN BE PRETTY OFFENSIVE TOO BECAUSE IT CAN SAY NASTY THINGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT BUT NOT ALL MUSIC IS BAD.. IT DEPENDS ON THE KIND OF MUSIC YOU LIKE TO LISTEN TO IF IT SAYS NASTY THINGS BECAUSE THERE IS MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MUSIC TO LISTEN TOO.,2,2
3032,"In my opinion, books, movies, magazines, ect., should not be taken off the shelves if they are offensive to some people. this is because everyone has different views on everything. Another reson is because for learning purposes in schools and etc. As well as authors would not want to be writting books because the books shelves are empty and their books, movies, magazines are getting rejected.     Since most people have different veiws on everything then,   every book or magazine would be taken off the shelf if they were offensive because, therefore, there would not be any book or magazine left on the shelf. This is because people think different things are offensive so what somebody thinks is offensive it @MONTH1 not be to another person. Therefore people would be angered or upset if their favorite book was taken off the shelf because someone said it was offensive.      Another problem with taking 'offensive' books of the shelf is that it would be a result in people not learning in schools and ect. This is because we all have to go through some point in school where we find something offensive for example wars, slavery, and politics. If all these books were to be taken off the shelves then nobody would be learning about any of this. In conclusion noboby would be being taught why these events happened and  why these events are wrong, so people would not have changed, they would keep doing these things because they were not taught not to. This in my opinion would cause alot of conflict between people and nobody would be educated on these events of history.      On the other hand rather than books being taken off the shelf books would not be being put on the shelfs. In this I mean that authors, producers, would not be making movies or writting books because their work just keeps getting rejected. Not only rejected but nobdy is going to go through the time and effort to make one of these for it to be rejected because it was offensive. In my opinion it would almost be impossible for these authors/ directors to make a unoffensive book or movie for everyone that is going to read or watch it.      In conclusion I have read many books in class every year that offends at least one person, but this person can choose not to finish the movie, book, or magazine if they find it offensive, or they never have to read it again. In conclusion there are many reasons why books should stay on the shelf even if they are offensive to someone. This is because it would not help with people being educated on events that happened, and people would not be reading any books in school. As well as authors would not be writting since their books are getting removed and the shelves are empty",4,4
3234,"A library is a place to go when inneed of solitude and peace with researching or reading. There is no reason other than someones opion to why certain materails should be removed from libraries. We the people have a right to read what others have composed thourgh their thoughts and ideas.      Certain materail @MONTH1 be offensive to different people, but to the others that could use that materail for research or for pleasure reading, would not be fair. If certain materials were removed because of someones action to there personal or religious opion, then those materials would nopt be avalible for those that would need to posess that information.     Did anyone think when they asked for the certain offensive materail to be removed? If people did they would relize that someone had to put an enormous amount of effort to get that infomation out to the world. How do you think that author would feel? You just had their best work pulled from the shelfs because you think it is offensive. How would you feel if some to your best peice of writing and complained that libraries cannot put this on their shelfs because its offensive.     There has been certain matierals I have listen to or read tht I thought could be offensive to certain people, but that is the media that writes the society as we read it. Some of those people @MONTH1 have certain religions that say they can't read or listen to certain things. Maybe not even watch certain materials but others, that might be there part of livlyhood.     We can't just take materials off the shelfs of libraries. That material is the life blood of our society. If you cut the blood flow, bad things are bound to happen after that. For whoever reads this, remember what we produces as media is who we are, what we do , and what we live for.",3,4
4408,"Should books, music, movies, magazines, etc. be removed from libraries if they are found offensive? My opinion on this is no. In this essay I will explain my opinion and hopefully change other peoples opinions. I will also explain how the past has an effect on present day.       In some cases books, music, movies, magazines, etc. @MONTH1 offend any race or a sertain sex, but that is what happened in the history of the @LOCATION1. Some @MONTH1 be very offensive but it only shows a past, others @MONTH1 just be plain out racist or sexist. Those that show the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 history are an education sorce so we can learn from mistakes. Here is exactly why I state this opinion, taking this material off shelves is like taking someones freedom of speach away. I hate when I here music that disrespects women but im not going to try and get it taken away because it might just be expressing how the artist of the song loved someone or how history for their family @MONTH1 have been.     In conclusion, I believe this material should not be taken off the shelves. After explaining my opinion think about what is offensive or just someone expressing a past memory. If a past was offensive something tody might be offensive, as I was told earlier in my life treat others as you want to be treated. I hope i caught attention and changed some opinions because alot of offence today has resulted from the past",3,3
3327,"BOOKSDear @PERSON1,@CAPS1 @CAPS2 staring to tell you about the books in the libraries that some adults find offensive so for the kids. These books should be taken away so kids won't read them, second part is adults should protest so the libraries could get does maganzines away or etc, and my last thing is @CAPS4 do libraries get these books and let kids take them so they could read them.The first example @CAPS2 giving is I founded some books and other things that I search being offensive for kids. And the libraries letting kids read them without an I.D because they are for adults reading sections. These books need to be away so kids won't read offensive things or trying to them. They should pbs books so under age children could read and so parents don't have to be worry about there kids what they are reading in there free time.The second example is parents should protest so books or other etc things could be rid of. Parents need to protest so any thing they find offensive should get off of the shelve. Or another thing is they will have to make a list of what books are offensive and let only adults read them by having an I.D and could sound a little better so books or etc don't get rid of the books.The last example is @CAPS4 do libraries let kids take them home and read them.They should what kids need to read like educational books for school or for other things. Adults need to see what there kids read this days. Kids need to understand what books are good for them from there age and otherwise their brain will start confusing them at their age.The conclusion is that libraries need to make something up so children don't read these kind of books that the only thing will do is mess up with there brain and then there parents will need to pay so their children could take therapy and others kids so their brain could be better. So please libraries do something so parents don't need to worry about what there kids read these days. Like for me I won't like my kid read offensive things because they will start doin the same things so libraries do something about these on offensive things.",3,3
3223,"There are different types of books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders in libraries. Books can be fiction or nonfiction. However, books or any other items can be offensive to people but to others it is just a book to read. So therefore, libraries should not remove books or any other items from the shelf.      Who picks out the books, movies, magnazines, and tape recorders? The answer is the customers at the library. The authors of the books or items did not. The authors gave the decision to choice between books or items. No one can blame the authors. Also, there are different kinds and different types of writtters or artists. Writters and artists took their time for completing a novel or series for us to read or hear. People should not take it seriously about books or other source because it can be nonfiction are fiction.      My next example why libraries should not remove items off the shelf is it might offensed someone but not to others. For example slavery can offensed a colored person but to others it is just a historical event. People need to know what happened in the past with historical events. People need to read the introduction before checking out the book to know if they like it or not. Therefore, people should not try to remove it.                    If a child checks out a book and their parents let them, it is the parents fault. It is there fault because parents let their child check the items out. Also, if a person has a problem with books or any other sources then complain but the libraries should not remove it from the shelf. Like I said before, one person might not like the book or other source but another person might like it.           Libraries are for people to check out books or other sources, and not to remove books or other source off the shelves.",3,3
3451,"The library is a public area where anyone can visit to find a book, movie, or magazine of their desire. Not everyone is interested in the same book genre. The library is meant to have almost any book someone could think of. If someone discovers a book or movie that offends them, they should not make a big deal about it. They should not be removed from the shelves of the library.      I am against the removal of offensive entertainment because it is not fair to everyone else that is a member of the library. What if a group of adults enjoyed a movie that someone else thought was disturbing? If the library took that movie off of the shelves, they would lose business due to one person. If a mother of a six year old boy wanted to report an inappropiate movie to the librarian, it would not be fair to anyone that is mature enough for that movie. It just is not fair to everyone else.     The library is public property. With that being said, it is the library's job to please the public's desires for entertainment. They are obligated to suppy books, movies, etc. for whomever. If one person does not like a particular book or magazine, they should search somewhere else for what they want.      A few years back, my mom stopped taking my brother and I to the library. There were too many complaints about inappropiat books being supplied or taken off of the shelves. That year, the library lost @PERCENT1 of their customers because everytime the library tried pleasing them, someone else was not pleased.      If every article of entertainment were to remain on the shelf in the library, everyone would be happy. If someone does not approve of a movie or something, they can search another shelf. Those who complain are only making more work for themselves.",4,4
4521,"If you found a movie that you really enjoyed at the library, would you get mad if the library just tok it away and there was no other place to get it? If one person doesnt like something they see at the library doesnt mean its not educational, and just get rid of it. Just because somebody doesnt like the one thing doesnt mean another person will. I dont think they should get rid of movies, music, books, or magazines just because of one person. Here is somethings that will make you think about geting rid of all these catagories.    One thing about movies that I like are they are good for visual aids. some people are better learners if they visualize something, they can get a better understanding of the purpose or the cause of the situation and they might learn faster. Another thing about movies in the library are becasue they show you things in the movie that you wouldnt be able to see if you were just reading a book. One thing that i like personally is that when people are in movies its like you are actually talking to me like me and the actor are really having a confersation. When you look at movie it gives you a visual picture of whats going on, even if the content isnt apropreate. Thats al the reasons why i think that movies shouldnt be taken away because someone thinks that the movies are volgure and not censored.     Music is another rule that they shouldn't get rid of. Music is almost the only thing you can calm you down so that you can focus again. Another thing that music does to you, is it soothe's the mind so that you can relax and you wont bother anybody else. When you listen to music , it blocks out other sounds that you might get distracted from. so those are the reasons why music shouldnt be rid of.     Magazine and books are the basics of a library. If you get rid of those, then it wouldnt be a library anymore. books are the basic learning methods of education. People learn the most information  out of a book or magazine. If you take those away its like your trying to hold people back from education and knowledge that they have in books. So if you get rid of magazines and books then it wouldnt even be a library any more.     if you get rid of movies from the library then people want be able to have a visual aid as there alternative way of learning. If you get rid of music from the library, you wont be able to consintrate as well on one thing if your constantly getting disturbed by other noise around you. Last but not least if you get rid of books from the library then it would be a library anymore it will just be a place to go like any other place. The library wouldnt be anything any more. Now would you want that? thank you",4,4
3816,"Should books, music, movies, and magazines be removed if found offensive? Well i think that they they should be put to a vot for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide. That some might not find it offensieve as others do. No because people have different beleafs than others.     I think they should be put to a vote for everyone, who goes to that library, to decide because the staff might think its morally incorrect and morally offensive. But others like the people checking out the books might think differently then the staff. The staff is not the one who reads all the books their customers do.     Some might not find it offensive as other do because every one person thinks differently. No one person thinks the same reson unless they have been told what another person thinks. the library might loss its people if they take a book out for the wrong reason. Weather they like it or not all books teach a lesson about life.     No because people have different beleafs then others. In one culter that book might be aloud and they might live around that library. So that would make then miss out on going to the library for books. For example, if the library choose to take out the bible and romance novels then they would loss a lot of customers. Their business would fall.     The library staff should not be aloud to choose what books are aloud because if some one has a fine they get money.  So my answer is no because they shuld put it to a vote, some might not find it as offensive as others do, and people have different beleafs than others do. No one person has the same thought that the next person does it is impossible",3,3
3820,"Should books, magazines, music, and movies be removed from shelves, if found offensive? I think the answer is yes, as long as it offends more than a few people. If it only offends a few people, then I think the answer should be no.     Why should they be removed if they offend a lot of people? They should be removed because offensive things can lead to more dramatic things. It's almost like when people were segragted by race. The segragation led to fights between the people. How would you feel if segragation was still around? You might be upset and find it unfair, because you cannot do some things. That is probabally how some people feel when they get offended by the media.     Why shouldn't they be removed for offending a few people? They shouldn't be removed because they might be able to help younger generations decide what is right and wrong. They could help by giving the people choices of what is right and what is wrong. If there was nothing out there that offended anyone, how would younger generations learn how to decided what is right and wrong?     In my opinion, it all depends on how many people are offended by it. There are ups and downs either way it goes. If you removed everything that offended anyone, it would be harder to teach younger generations to decided what is right and wrong by themselves. This would mainly be because you would only have one point of view, the point of view that is perfect for everybody. The way I see it, that point of view does not exsist. Therefore, I believe by removing everything that is offensive to anyone, we would not have a media. However, if we did not remove anything that was offensive, serious issues could occur. For example, fights could break out or wars could even start, depending on how many people were offended. The last thing we need in our society is fighting. So my answer for removing offensive things would have to be yes and no.",3,3
3557,"What do I think about library censorship? I believe that there should be some censorship, but not too much censorship. Each person has their own interests and should be able to find something in their library to suit their interest.     Certain materials are too strong to be put in libraries. There are stores that could provide you with that material for you to purchase. Most parents wouldn't like their child to be exposed to these certain materials, so they believe that the libraries shouldn't provide these types of materials.     Now there are some materials that are pushing the line of their content. They are strong, but not too strong to not be put in libraries. Some people enjoy these strong materials and should be able to find them in their libraries for their pleasure.     Just because someone doesn't enjoy this material that the library has provided, doesn't mean that the material should be taken away. If that was how things worked there would be nothing in the library for people to enjoy. Every person has their own taste in materials, be it more mature materials or a little more 'tame' materials. Everyone is inclined to their opinions, but their opinion doesn't decide what is and isn't in their library.     I myself enjoy a wide choice of materials from libraries. Some strong materials, some more 'tame' materials. It all depends on the persons own interests and choices. Sometimes I @MONTH1 be disapointed when I'm looking for something in a library and it's not there, because to some people it's too strong but to me and others it's just a good source of harmless entertainment.     In conclusion I think that there should be some censorship in libraries, but not too much censorship that people can't find things that interest them. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and has their own form of entertainment, but their libraries shouldn't be built on an indivdual's opinions.",3,4
3971,"Censorship in libraries should not be allowed. I believe that even if books, music, movies or magazines on the bookshelves are offense, they should still be left there. They are apart of our history and the history we're creating.     If anyone wants to read a certain book or magazine, there's a big chance they will end up reading it. There are so many ways to get to those things with the technology we have today. You could just look them up online and read them or listen to them off the computer.     Also, censoring in libraries, where everyone feels tranquil and comfortable, can make people rebel and even put the library out of business.     From what i've observed, most people look up inappropriate or offensive things on the internet already. Especially if they know that it's something that could be debated about being censored.     A lot of books and movies, great ones even, contain some offensive content but they are classics. Generations, one after the other, have enjoyed them.     Now tell me, who would want to be the unreasonable person and take that away from anyone who is interested? Everyone should have the right to these books, magazines, movies, and music. Libraries should not censor them.",3,3
3462,"How often do you find a book or a magazine that you don't want children or someone to read?  I mean I find them everyday for example, how people use there language like swearing or even the tv show they watch. I also hear when im with my friends or in a crowd of people. You hear them everyday even if you don't want to, but you do.     I do believe libraries shouldn't even have that in where children can reach them or even in the library period. Its a public places and no one wants to see anyone with those books in the librarey.  What would happen if a child got ahold of one and they were looking it and if gave them nightmares or if it deals with crimes, rap, or miss happens with something wrong.     Sometimes what children read, they will say it or they will do it. so if a child see it they @MONTH1 think its alright to do it or they might think its amazing or cool to do and they might do it. Also again, you hear it on a daily basic like swearing. Lets say your child hears or reads horable language and they might say it to you or some of your friends, and you wont know where they heared or who told them.     The movies even have something to do with it to, because it all the movies are together kids to adults movies. they should separet the movies or even get rid of the movies because the children could look at the case and see something scary or drug related, something that you dont want your children to or even hear to.     Even though you hear them daily, you should never get them from the public library or even any public place where children are around.  They need to take those book that discribe anything about crime, drugs, or even movies. Thats why i think they should get rid of those books and movies off the shevles and get them away from children",3,3
4760,"Certain books, magazines, music and movies should not be put on the shelves of a library. Children can learn rude or nasty things that their parents might not find alright for their child. There are some things that can be offensive in a library like prejudice books or music. Often music uses swearing language or states certain views on politics.     Libraries need to take control of this issue the right way. Getting rid of the material is not what should be done. Libraries need to keep better watch over certain sections of the library. They could do this by not letting children leave their parents side. That way parents can know and control what their children are seeing.     Then there is the issue of offending people. These problems could be resolved simply by putting up signs in different spots of the library. These sign could be in big bold letters stating 'Certain things in this section can be offending', '@CAPS1 control needed past this point'. Libraries should be more aware of how people feel about the way they are set up and presented to the public. Libraries should put them selves in the publics shoes, to see how they would like it if some of these things were showed to their children. Also, looking at things in a point of view of how some things could be offending, to fix the problems.     Once when I was in a library I was offended by a book title that was against my religion. After seeing that I thought if their were a sign or something around to warn me I would not of had to see that. Other things like this have occured in a library like one time my brother rented a movie my parents did not approve of. But with the way the libraries are set up and controled my brother was able to rent the movie and sneak it past my parents. Other children like my brother could do the same things only worse like look at an inappropiate magazine or read certain books that parents would not approve.     These types of occurances need to stop before something really bad happens. Libraries need to take control and show they know how to present things to the public in a proper manner. Actions that are happening in todays libraries are not alright. Putting up signs and requiring @CAPS1 control can reduce if not elliminate these unapproved occurances",3,3
3430,"What do you consider an offensive book? Everyone has their own personal opinion on what they think is offensive. So how can you justify that a book, magizine, movie, music, etc. should be removed from a shelf due to content. Of course there are the ones that most people would aggree that are offensive to young kids and even some adults but then again other people don't find the same things offensive. The items that do contain graphic content, cursing, etc. and does offend most people should be set aside and putting in a different shelving area away from the others. So honestly no one can say that a certain book(s), music, movie(s), magazine(s), etc. do not have a right to have a place on a shelf and should or shouldn't be removed.      If parents dont want there children or teenagers looking or seeing certain material that is something that the parents need to take into their own hands not a library or anywhere else. Now if this is an item at the home of a parent and they dont want their kids to see it they have every write to remove it from the shelf. Then again if their child or teen finds this item and looks at it and the parents didn't want them to they shouldn't have bought it in the first place of they should have removed the item.     So can you as a stranger justify wheather or not somthing is offensive and a parent shouldn't let their kid look at it, or that a library or store shouldn't have that item on the shelf? No you can't. If you don't want you children to see it or if you don't set standards and rules",3,3
4589,"The library is a very sourceful place but there are just some things that should not be displayed or made veiwable to the public. Some topics or other things found in the library are not suitable for every one and should not be allowed in a public place.     First, there should be a censorship on what you can and can not get or look up at a library. What if some one looks up or check out something that should not be seen by others and it ends up in the wrong hands of someone. That person then could end up using the information for the worst. Everything that's in the library is not appropriate for all ages.     Next, there is a lot of offensive things you can find in the library. So things should be censored so one one ends up gettin hurt. The librarian or any one whos in there @MONTH1 never know what someone looked up or is planning until after it @MONTH1 happen or a problem is started.

Finally, although people @MONTH1 feel it's no one eleses business what they research or check out, they should think, it is open to the public and anyone could easily see or go back to what they were looking at. Its not fair to be in a public place and get hurt by the offensiveness of some one. People have to think the library is open to children and elderly.     In conclusion, there should be a censorship on what you can find in the library. There is hurtful and inappropriate things that should absolutly not be allowed. Most important a library is a place that you should not get offended in by what some one looks up, checks out or even says.",4,4
4536,"To @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @MONTH1 @CAPS3:          Censorship, does @CAPS2 deserve a place in our society?      There has been much contreversy over this topic. Some claim that certain kinds of literature and music contain offensive lyrics or writings, while others, over the same topic, believe the complete opposite. They believe that the words of the artists and authors shows feelings and have messages hidden within words of vulgarity, which is where i stand on the situation.     @CAPS2 seems as though everytime we cross over this bridge, @CAPS2 comes right back in front of us. Many of those opposed to the freedom of writing and music are usually the ones that feel as if they must preform proper edicate and have everyone act nothing less of the same, unfortunately for many, the people that are like this, usually, have much power in the say of what comes and what goes, not allowing many of us lower graded people in society to get a chance to veto their poor outlook on things.      My opinions bring me to believe that there are two sides to this story too. However, I still believe that much of what is considered 'censored' material should not be censored at all. There is one, count that, one situation where I feel censorship is necessary. One is songs that go on for @NUM1 and a half minutes saying nothing but '*bleep* this, and *bleep that'.      All other material, whether @CAPS2 be @CAPS4 rapping or @PERSON1 writing, is acceptable. There's just many people in the world who need to grow up and listen to the lyrics/words, to get the full message before automatically assuming that there is a problem with @CAPS2. Great @CAPS5, @ORGANIZATION1, he always has a message in his music, whether @CAPS2 be about family or just life in general, however many words he uses are considered unfit for our time, so you just hear '*bleep*' when @CAPS2 is on the radio. By just that '*bleep*', you can lose the message thats coming across.      Also, ever hear the phrase, 'equal rights'? Well, shouldn't music and literature be a right? @CAPS2's just like talking but with either pages or instruments. And that's how I will leave you on this debateable topic. I hope I might have changed some opinions of you today, if not then your loss. Thank you for your time.

3108,"Libraries are known as places where a person can go to find material on almost any topic they could want to learn about, whether that material is a book, movie, or magazine. Anyone can use the library, and it is a valuable resource to many people. So why do some libraries insist on removing some of those valuable materials from their shelves?     In past years, censorship in libraries has been the focus of many news reports. In almost all cases, library patrons have been angry that certain materials have been deemed unsuitable to be offered at the library. I have to say that I agree with them. People have a right to choose what books they want to read, what movies they want to watch, and what music they want to listen to. People have opinions; people disagree. What one person loves, another person could hate. But just because one person dislikes or is offended by a material on a library shelf does not mean that the opportunity to use that material should be denied to all other patrons. I feel that if a resource is checked out by just one individual, and that one individual is able to learn from or enjoy the resource, then the library has achieved its purpose and helped the community by offering that material.      In conclusion, censorship in libraries is limiting and wrong. It creates barriers for those who want to learn and it takes away people's freedom to make decisions for themselves. Everyone should be able to decide whether to pick up a library material, and censorship makes that impossible",3,3
4353,the scary book that you dont want your children to pick up off the shelf i think if your kids read it they would be scared having night mares and you probaly dont want that and if u have the right to move it your kids will have the right to move it because they see what you do they gonna wunt to do so u can do it when they are not around  and yea i believe that cetrtain materials.,2,2
4337,"Censoring @CAPS1     We all know that language is the foundation of human legacy.  Language is spoken to mean anything the speaker is trying to communicate.  To take books from the shelves is to steal the words from the mouths of many great speakers.  We have the obligation to keep the @CAPS1 that we have created alive.  If something is forgotten, it is as if nothing happened. If nothing happened, it will reoccur- good or bad.     To hide away words from our children is wrong.  If not by word of print, word of mouth will lead them to the same discoveries as they would have come to if reading it from a book.  But even more importantly, what good is hiding the truth?  When many speak of tragic incidences, they speak, '@CAPS2 forget.'  If we should not forget, why should the youth @CAPS2 learn?  There is nothing in print that can not be conveyed in a different communication form.     Our @CAPS1 is written on the pages of literature.  The books we read are the property of all humanity and should be read by all to educate us of our mistakes as well as our triumphs.  A commonly debated topic in the world of censorship is 'The @CAPS3 of @CAPS4 @CAPS5.'  @CAPS6 is a novel that displays what life was truly like in one of @LOCATION1's most racially barbaric times.  One might argue the fact that it uses an offensive 'n' word more than a few times.  To @CAPS6 one might argue that @PERSON3, the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 that stood by @PERSON2 was loved by @PERSON2.  A book in @CAPS6 time displaying a friendship between a black and a white man is truly a ground breaking feat.  The 'n' word was common place in @CAPS6 time period- a friendship between a black man and a white man was not.  Is it really important that a child knows of just another offensive word that they are bound to discover eventually anyway, or is it more important that they learn that color of skin does not change a person?  Do not take the opportunity for a child to learn what really matters away.     To take one book away is to take all of them away.  Censoring one piece of literature opens the doors of debate for every other piece ever created.  The world has seen what can happen when things get censored.  During @PERSON1's dictatorship, nearly everything from the internet, to books, to newspwpers, to television programming, to movies, to music, to magazines were censored so only what the dictatorship wanted got through.  The people were brainwashed, and those who were not rose up, and when they did they were shot down.  Do not let the world come to that.  We are better than that and our literature shows it.     In other words, to censor media and the literature that surrounds us, we deprive ourselves of education and freedoms that are critical to the well being of future generations.  Do not hide the free speech of authors, do not hide our @CAPS1 from our children, do not let us make the same mistake that has been made before.  Let us educate our children for the future of humanity.  Let our @CAPS1 not repeat itself. Let us innovate and create a new, better world.  Let us allow our words to flow freely.  Let us allow our legacy to live on.",5,4
4344,"In many @CAPS1 libraries across the nation, a numerous amount of: books, magazines, movies and music aren't provided because they are found offensive. I do not believe this should happen because everybody is unique and @MONTH1 find different types of work offensive. Who is it that chooses these items to be taken out of libraries and why should they be the only ones to say what goes and what stays?      Everybody is different in their own way and everyone has their own interests and opinions. Some people are athletic, gothic, preppy and nerdy. The library is open to anybody that wishes to enter. What happens if the people that choose what content is provided in the library, doesn't like scary books, so they take all of the scary books out? What if their is a person that only reads scary books? What then will they have to read? I bet if that person had the ability to choose what stays and what goes in the library, they would only have horror in the library. I do not believe that anybody should have the right to censor what content is provided in @CAPS1 libraries. Everyone has their own opinion and interests so they should have everything open in libraries.     There is a reason that @CAPS1 libraries are called @CAPS1. That means that it is open to anyone and everyone. There should be all kinds of different genres to read and all sorts of movies to choose from. Just because one person doesn't like a certain kind of genre, or doesn't find it appropriate for a certain viewing audience, does not mean that they can take it out of a @CAPS1 library. That would be why there is such thing as sections in libraries. If you don't find a certain type of book appropriate, place it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' section of your library. For example: @PERSON1, he is a very popular author to many different viewing audiences. His ideas are very different than most. He writes horror but displays gore and a lot of sexual content in his writing. It is his own writing style. If the people that choose what is in the libraries, don't find that appropriate or if they find it offensive, they should put it in the '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' sections or even the '@CAPS3' section. It should be up to the childrens' parents what their kid is reading; not the library itself.     I do not believe that anyone should choose what is and isn't provided in libraries. Everybody is unique, different and have their own opinions on different things and ideas. If you remove a specific type of book, movie, magazine or music from a library, and it's the only kind a certain person reads, what then will they have to read? What if somebody took out the kind that only you like to read? What then will you do? If everybody had the choice and right to do this, I don't think that anything will be left in libraries. All genres of everything should be available to the @CAPS1. If you don't find a book appropriate, place it in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 section of your library to still have it open to anybody. That would just be a big @CAPS9 to anybody who decides to pick it up and read it. You need to think of everybody, not just yourself.",4,4
3432,"'@CAPS1 Should be Taken off the @CAPS2'     @CAPS1 should be taken off the shelves? Nothing. At least thats @CAPS1 I think. For ant book you can find some bad thing about it. People can not keep bad things away from kids it doesnt work @CAPS4 that. Wether it is cusing, sex, gore, racsisem teens will find them and I think it would be better if they were foung in a book instead of real life.     Most young adult books have cusing. There is no way around it. Teens hear cusing every day. At home, school, or even at work and yes it is offensive and no there is nothing you can do to stop it. It is there and part of our life.     Most adults think thats if they don't shelter teens then they will find all this bad stuff in music. @CAPS1 adults don't understand is that teens doo @CAPS1 ever they want to be happy. The music of today's is very offensive, but the @CAPS4 it!!!!! THat is @CAPS1 is 'hot' in the music world right now.     Ok say a kid was from a run down home and all he had was a radio, and that radio only got one station and the station was pop music, which most parents don't @CAPS4. That pop music would make the kid happy. Would you really take that away from him just because it is offensive???     Sex a lot of really good books have sex in there, but if a kid is at home reading about sex the he or she is not out doing it. Plus sex makes books better. I read books that contain rape, and other sexual acts but I've never done it only read about it.      Race is anouther big deal. 'To @CAPS5 a @CAPS6' is an amazing book and every kid should read it so they can learn. That is the whole point in reading is so you can learn. We need to learn about those kind of thing.      Keep us sheltered is not going to protect us it only makes us want @CAPS1 ever we can't have even more. Music, books, magazines, and other stuff help us learn dont take that away from us. If we don't @CAPS4 it we will not read it or leason to it. Don't chose for us let us learn on our own. It is our life. Let us make our own mistakes....",4,4
3444,"I do not believe that movies, books, music, etc. should be removed from shelves. I believe that people are entitled to their own opinion about what they choose to listen to, read or watch, everybody has their own level of maturity. Parents who are concerned about their child watching/reading something, always have the right to tell them no, and to keep whatever it is out of their grasp.      People are entitled to their own opinion on what is appropriate level material for themselves. Whether it is books, movies or music, a person always has the choice of whether or not they want to be in contact with that item. It is a good idea to keep more explicit things only for adults, but if it is supposed to be for a certain age level, it shoud be out for the choice to be up to that certain person. Different people have different levels of maturity, so it is hard for one person or company to say  what age level should or should not be using that material.     A lot of parents will disagree with this issue, because they think that children should be kept away from the violence and vulgar images or language that are in the media these days. But at the same time, they fight for the right to raise their child the way they want to. People have the right to take away material that is too mature for their child, but no one should be able to say that someone else's child should not be able to view that material, because just because one person @MONTH1 find it offensive, does not mean that other people will.     If someone should find something offensive they should have the common sense to not view that material any more, it's that simple. Everyone has that right so I do not think that companies have the right to take that away from them. Parents can censor what their children watch, and adults have the ability to make their own decisions about this topic. This proves that certain items, like books, movies, and music, should not be taken off the shelf.",4,4
3909,"Would you let someone ban your favorite movie, just because it has mildly offensive materials in it? I know I would not.  If everyone had the right to ban books then we would have no books, because something would offend someone. You should not ban books because it desecrates our individuality , we have the freedom of press, and because it would ruin the future.      If you ban a book then you are giving up your indiviuality. If you let someone decide what is offesive to you, then how can you express yourself. Therefore, by letting someone else decide what is appropriate for you to read, you are giving up your freedom. By banning books, you are not being yourself you are conforming to what other people want. Therefore, you should not ban books because, it demolishes your individuality, and it makes you conform to what other people want.      There should not be any banning of books. You should not be able to ban books because we have the freedom of press. The freedom of press means that we can write whatever we want. However, you should not ban books because we have the freedom to choose what we read. This means that we as individuals should be able to decide what we want to read and what we do not. You should not ban books because we have the freedom of press, and because we have the freedom as individuals to read what we want.     If you ban books then you will ruin the future. There are hundreds of really phenomenal books out there that would be banned, and future people would not be able to enjoy them.  There are books that can change your life, and teach you how to deal with things, and  if we ban them then we are ruining the chance to help future people with their problems. People turn to books for knowledge, and help, and for ideas, and if we take away their books then how can we say that we are paving the way for the future if we are destroying it along the way. Books should not be banned because if they were then, we would be ruining the future for others, and we would be destroying our own future.     In conclusion, books should not be banned because, it limits our individuality, we have the freedom of press, and because it destroys our future. If you ban books , more likely than not, your favorite book would get banned. Also, if everyone could ban books, then there would be nothing to read because all of the books would be banned. By banning books you are destroying the future, limiting our freedoms, and abolishing our indivuality.",4,4
3989,"People of the world @MONTH1 always find something they think is offensive that others don't. In this case I think that if it is in a public library they do need to watch what they put on the shelves. If some little kid grabs a playboy from the youngster's section, the library is probably going to get sued. Libraries are supposed to be a place where people can get a book to read or to look up some information about any school-work they have. Books about anatomy are an exeption but if that library has a book like sex for dummies then something needs to @CAPS1 in that facility.     Movies too, if somebody wants that kind of material they need to go else where to find it. Exposing those kinds of movie clips and images could be harmful to the children of future @LOCATION1. If our world crashes as we know it because kids couldn't find the correct information needed, then that shows that we deserved it.    What kind of movies we watch, advertisement we pay attention to, what music we listen to most, and many other things are what make people who they truly are. People these days read magazines that can be completely harmless but come with an ad. that says @CAPS2 @CAPS3, or All @CAPS4 @CAPS5, these are found in a lot of magazines like @CAPS6 @CAPS7 and sometimes @CAPS8. These ads. are totaly uncalled for.     If people looked into this more, than they do we wouldn't have to fight this as much.     These things that people find to be offensive are harsh and cruel things to show our young readers, writers, and musicians. These type of things influence kids to do this type of stuff that americans and non-americans find so offensive.

3955,"Some people often go to the library to check out books,movies,magazines,etc..But what some people might not realize is that some of the things that they have at the library might be offensive towards certain people. I think that everything thats in the libraries should stay there. Obviously the library allowed it there for some reason. So honestly it cant be that bad.          I do not think certain things should be removed from the library. People have to realize that that's life. There's going to be certain things that you dont like but you have to deal with it. If you watch tv you'll notice that there's some offensive things towards certain people. But no one really makes a huge thing out of it.               The books might be offensive to you but to someone else it could just be another book that they want to read.With no intentive purpose of offending anyone. The library is all about learning. Everything is for educational purposes. I've read books that I stopped and thought about for a second while I was reading it and noticed that theres some pretty harsh things in it. But i didn't complain about it, I just kept reading.            Alot of books are based off of true events so no matter how offensive they are to people, you just have to think what the purpose was for the author to create this book and same thing with movies. So people can see what the author has to say. Everyone has the right to have their own opinion. And thats what most magazine articles are about. Expressing what you think about a certain topic.          Even in the @CAPS1 class that im in now we had to read 'To @CAPS2 A @CAPS3'. Some @CAPS4 @CAPS5 people might think its racist but it reallu isn't. The author is trying to get his point out. Of how things use to be before white and colored people were treated the same. Now if you still think that is being offensive towards you or other people then thats alright. That's why this is a free country. Everyone has the right to say how they feel and not get in trouble for it.          So I hope i got the point across that it's alright for some things to be offensive towards people. As long as thats not the whole point of what you watching or reading. Which i doubt it is. So next time your reading or watching something that is offending you. Think about the point that the person who wrote or made the movie were trying to get across. Mybe by it offending you it is getting the point across.",4,4

I wouldnt want anybody in a libary unsatistfied with the books, movies, music or anything else especially if childern are involed.People should be able to go to a public place where they are satistfied with the way they carry their place, also it should be suitable place for childern to come and learn.The libary is a learning enviorment where education, growth and devolopement should be inspired.     My reason for saying all this is that a library should be a place where learning should be its number one goal and that if things in the libary are offensive to a person that it should be taken off the shelf.

4072,"Censorship in today's libraries is a major issue. There are groups who both support and challenge these ideas of censoring books and other media from our children. Do you think it is right for someone else to decide what we can or can't read? Personally, I believe that we should be able to make our own choices when deciding if a book or movie is too indescent to read or not.     We as human beings have the ability to make our own decisions. Everyday we are faced with hundreds of decisions; whether it be what outfit we are going to wear for the day, or what type of food we want to eat. In that sense, nobody can tell us that we can't do these things so why should they be allowed to tell us what we can or can't read? What @MONTH1 look vulgar to someone, might not look so offensive to another individual. Everybody has a different taste in media. That is why it is wrong for someone to make decisions on what to watch or read for someone else. What they think is wrong @MONTH1 be completely normal to the individual they are making the decison for.     Censoring of media for kids should be the responsibility of the parents. If a parent does not want their child to be exposed to a certain element of media then that parent should not allow their child to see or read it. Everybody has their own opinion on things, that is what makes us human individuals. The ability to make and process decisons is one of the human races greatest talents. These descisions should never be left up to someone sitting in an office in @LOCATION1. When the government is making decisions that effect us that personally, do we still truly have freedom?       When censorship of television comes into question I believe that this is the reason we have ratings. Theses ratings warn people of the content included, whether graphic or not. With these in place, there is no reason why we should completely remove shows or movies from the public. I believe that the same should be done for books. Books should be required to have an age appropriate rating on them. If you are under the age required to purchase or check-out a book, then you will be rejected and not able to get the book. Ratings worked with television and movies, so why can they not work for books to?      In some cases, some media should be destroyed and hidden from public. Media that show racism towards any ethnicity or religion should be banned. By doing so, I believe the only effects this will have on society are positive ones. Censoring these types or movies, books, ect. can save a lot of people hurt or embarrassment.      I believe that we should be allowed to choose which books, shows, or movies we read or watch. This includes all forms of media, excluding any media that provoke racism and hate against a group of people. The decisions we make should be influenced by a rating system put in place for all media. We as humans have the birth given right of making our own decisions. This right should never be taken away from us",4,4
4129,"'Everyone has @CAPS1 @CAPS2'     @CAPS3 is true that everyone has their own @CAPS2 and their likes and dislikes. For example, books. I do not like books that are about illegal substances, but I do believe removing certain materials that are offensive should not be removed from the shelves in the library. @CAPS3 is true that finding inappropriate book or an article @MONTH1 be disturbing to certain people, but @CAPS3 does not mean that everyone finds @CAPS3 offenive.     Once, my @CAPS4 class was assigned to do a book project. The main pourpose was to find a non-fiction book and create a powerpoint presentation on the main ideas of that book. One of the classmate read and had a breif presentaion over a book that was about illegal drugs. I know in fact that not many people are offended by the words such as 'drugs' or 'alchol', but I find these words to be obnoxious. While I found @CAPS3 disturbing and uncomfortable, others found @CAPS3 interesting. @CAPS3 was a topic that drew their attention, but not very appealing to me.     Another example would be the time I went to the library to write a research paper about the human body systems. My friend, @LOCATION1, found @CAPS3 disturbing to look at some pictures because @CAPS3 showed blood. Strangly, I never thought blood as anything disturbing. While @PERSON1 found @CAPS3 disgusting to look at, my head was in the book because @CAPS3 was fascinating. I always thought how the human body works is incredible. What @PERSON1 did was instead of trying to deal with the picture, she wondered off and tried to find another book that does not have any grotesque pictures. The book did not have any benefit to @LOCATION1, but because of that book, I received an 'A' on the research paper.     I believe @CAPS3 is important that people accept the fact that everyone does not have the same opinion. Every individual is different in their own way. As I mentioned before, the book that was disturbing to me was interesting to others and vice versa. That is normal and there is nothing we can do to change about @CAPS3. If permission were given to remove any certain materials that is offensive to each and every person, I guarentee that there would not be any material left on the shelves. I think the best way to solve this problem is for he/she to ignore the book that seems to be offensive and look for different material because others might need the resource",4,4
4199,"Libraries are often thought of as a room full of books inside a school building. On the contrary, they are all over the country, and are used by people of all ages. Because of that, I feel that there should not be a restriction on what books a library puts on their shelves. If the books and magazines are labeled, then a person can just stay away from what he or she finds offensive. However, in the case of a school library, all the books of course should be age appropriate.     Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean you neighbor won't. If someone find a movie ridiculous and inappropriate, that doesn't mean someone else will too. Since all people are different, no one will like the same movies as the next person. Therefor, a personally offensive movie should not be removed from the shelves and prevent the enjoyment of another individual. That is the same with magazines, books, and anything available at a library.         Parental concern for their children is also a factor. However, if a public library has a section of books or magazines that is found to be offensive by a parent of a young child, I do not think that should require the library to remove the book. This is where I believe organization and limitations come in. The adult books and magazines that might be offensive for children should be in a section in a separate room, or on a different level of the building. That would prevent the accidental discovery by children. Along with organization, I think there should be a limitation, so that if a child was to purposely walk into that section and grab a book that was not appropriate, or offensive to the parent, then they would not be able to check it out at the desk from the librarian.     Outside of public libaries, the school libraries have a different requirement in my opinion. Elementary libraries of course, should contain no inappropriate material to any extent.All of the material in an elementary library should be strictly for education. At that age, children are far too young for any form of adult humor or magazine article. At the @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3 level, I think things should change a little, but should still be much more strict than a public library, and contain absolutely no offensive content. I feel that magazines and joke books are welcome in the libraries of teenagers. Nothing that would be inappropriate for the school rules though of course.      Public libraries are a place for children and adults alike to find a book or movie to entertain themselves, and everyone has a different opinion. Because of that, there should be no restrictions in the public libraries, and you should be able to get the books or movies you want. Within a school corporation the environment changes, and the rules must be changed as well. Nothing offensive should be placed within a school library no matter how old the students are. Libraries should not be required to remove books from their shelves.",4,4
3004,"People are entitile to their own oppinion about things. What someone might find offensive someone else might not.           Libraries should be able to put anything that might interest a person who educate someone on there shelves wether people get offended or not. If we went by what everyone said we probably wouldnt have anything on the library shelves. People will find something wrong with everything a person can put out thats just human nature.              I have read nonfiction books and saw movies that are based on true storys that have used word and language that some people might find offensivc but how are people going to express their feelings and educate people without offending someone.                How are we suppose to teach history without telling the whole story. Slavery and the @PERSON1 were a horrible things that happened and teaching about it is important so that it does not happen again. It would be hard to teach about these horrible events without offending people.                     I believe that we should put these materials on out library shelves anyway, and if people do not like it then do not check them out or look at them. That's my opinion what's yours",4,3
3648,"Imagine walking out of your home and you see right down the street a giant bonfire, right in the open.  You see men walking into a library empty handed and walk out carrying armfuls of books, magazines, movies, and other media.  The men then toss them into the raging inferno and you seem them become incinerated, lost forever.  This is what will happen if we let censorship of our libraries take place. We should not let censorship of our libraries take place since it violates a constitutional right, will gradually make our society more and more ignorant, and will let this nation slide from a democratic nation to one where the beliefs and ideals of the people are controlled by a small group of people.     Letting censorship of our libraries take place will violate a basic constitutional right, plain and simple.  In the @ORGANIZATION1 it clearly says that there will be freedom of the press.  By tossing out certain literary works this right will be thrown to the side and by violating one constitutional right, what will come next? Will our freedom of speech be negated, or our freedom to assemble?  As citizens of the @LOCATION1 we can not let this happen to our great nation.     By allowing certain books and essays to be thrown out of our libraries, the people's knowledge base will eventually shrink down drastically.  For example take @PERSON1's theory of evolution, a very sensitive subject among people of the @CAPS1 faith.  If all of his works regarding that were to be thrown out, much information that was very valuable to biologists would be lost and those biologists would not be able to improve upon the existing pool of information.  If this was to take place our civilization would experience a lessening intellect and a expanding ignorance regarding many fields of knowledge.     Picture @CAPS2 in the @DATE1.  Hitler's @ORGANIZATION2 has taken power and our systematically destroying all materials they find to be subversive to the @ORGANIZATION2 cause, only allowing materials that contained beliefs and ideals that they thought were correct to exist in libraries.  This is exactly what we would be doing if we allowed censorship of our libraries to take place.  The censoring of the libraries would be controlled by a relatively small group of people which means that the censoring would be controlled by that same people's beliefs and ideals, and those same beliefs and ideals would thus  be forced upon the people, shaping the beliefs and ideals of the masses to those select few.       In conclusion, letting censorship take place in our public libraries will dismantle the basic structure of our society by violating a constitutional right, making our society gradually become more and more ignorant, and letting the beliefs and ideals of our people rest in the hands of a select few.  This is not what our @CAPS3 @CAPS4 envisioned @LOCATION2 to become and they were right.  Letting censorship exist in our public libraries is simply wrong",5,5
3844,"Libraries are stocked filled of all kind of reading materials. Such as books, magazines, and catalogs, but are all of these appropriate for the crowd that dwindle around a library? My answer is no, but should they be taken away from the librabires, no. Although many kids go through libraries so do many adults trying to find good pieces of litature, that is why they should keep these books available to most.     When i was in the seventh grade i recall reading a book, by the title of @PERSON2, about a child who had gotten sexually abused, i wish i had never picked up that book. Although it made me very frightened, it taught me a very good lesson. I learned at a young age to never associate with strangers, and if it wasn't for this novel it could have been very different. Therefore i believe it is good to get children at a young age small dosages of the real life, not every thing in the world is sugar coated like @PERSON3 would argue.     From @CAPS1 to the bible, there is a vast variety of litature. This variety provides stories for many audiences. The libraries try to do there best by catagorizing these books so that smaller children do not get there hands on the wrong books. Instead of taking the books totally out of the repitoure, another suggestion that could be made is to have a system like they do for mature rated video games and only allow people over the age of @NUM1 to check certain books out. This making it near impossible for children to get there hands on the wrong books.          Lastly, a suggestion that could be made is to label inappropriate books such as @CAPS2.Ds and movies. This could make a small difference and make children think twice before opening up a book labelled for mature audiences only. This providing stories for all, and protecting small children from magazines such as @CAPS3.          Like Katherine Paterson said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf... then you also have the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I percieve what she is trying to say is similar to what i am. She wants all the books to be provided and kids just to be shyed away from these, and hope that children can make the right decision when choosing a piece of litature from a library",4,4
4480,"When you have children would you want to shield them from something you think is wrong, even though it goes on in the world around you every single day? Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship.    One thing about censorship is that it is just a way the government can control what everyday people say, hear, listen to, read, or even see in today's society. We shouldn't be controlled on what we can or can't read, watch, or listen to. I have experienced these things almost on a daily basis if it isn't on the radio it's on television. When someones words get beeped out for saying something vulgar or innapropriate.     The second thing about censorship is that no matter what it is, where it is, or even who it is someone will always have a problem with it. Just recently in one of my own classes we read an article about a very popular chldren's and young adult's film and a school tried to ban its books from its library because it dealt with sorcery. Most of every person I know that has read those books knows that sorcery isn't real. Why do people find it necessary to do things like that? I think most people just view something that could be entertaining to one person as completely disgusting and disturbing, just because it is a little bit different, I find that as unique not bad.      The third thing is no matter what public libraries shouldn't be censored. Everyone views things differently and they all have different tastes in music, literature, and films. Just because someone likes something someone else @MONTH1 find vulgar doesn't mean they should just be able to remove that from the library's public shelves. After all the library is public and I put a great deal of stress on it being public because every person in the world today are all different.     Today in society even though we have freedom of speech the government has come up with something to even conflict that, censorship. Leaving off on a lighter foot, whether it is purple or green, or old or new, someone will always be able to find something wrong with it. I'm sorry to today's society for not being able to realize that most of its problem is trying to control everything that everyone does",4,4
4386,"I believe that if you let people take stuff off of the shelves that they didn't like then there would be nothing left. I thank this because there are a lot of parents that don't want their little kids to be seeing it or hearing it. That is because they could get infulenced to do the wrong thang and get themselves in truble for it. Then you have some parents that don't care what their kids are doing as long as they are leving them alone. Then you have some other that are very over procted.      Yes, I think that there are something that should be taken off shelves because they are very interpreit. They are because they are talking a drugs and alchole and trying to get young kids to try it and get addicated to it. That why they can get more money from it and those kids end up geting heard or died from it. All some of thies bussinesses are trying to do is get money from the young because they make to bottles or cantaners look cool. Most of the time you will have kids go for it but there are some kids that don't because they don't want to get in truble or heart themsleves.           There are some songs that should not be alowed to be played because of some of the stuff that they say. There are some people and some parents that listen to it and with there kids in the car then their kid will go to school and be sing it and get in truble for it. I think that their are a lot of thang that should be different but they are not because the bussinesses are just happy that they are geting money. They don't care how is buying it as long as they get there money for it and that is not the wright way to look at it you should care about the lives of people and their familys.            Then you have some magazines that have some uniperate pitchers in them. They do because they are trying to get guys to buy them just for that one pitcher that is in it. They want it because its a very pritty girl with just a bathing suite on or maybe nothing on. That is why they put it in there so they can get their money off of it. Most of the girls that are in them are modles and they are very pritty, but sometime there will be a little boy that takes his dad and then he takes it to school and get in truble for it. Then his partens are enbeist because they didn't know that he had.           That is why I thank that some stuff should be not on the shelves in stores. You will have partens that get it tten leave it laying out and their kids will get in then might take it to school. You should never leave anything that you don't want your kids to have laying out for them to get. That is why I believe that and what I thank about it",3,3
4159,"I believe that all types of books should be available to all types of people. A library should never be intended for a certain group of readers. As far as I'm concerned, books are creativity in text-form. Creativity is a large part of life, and without it, we would all be the same. There is at least one book for every person in the world, and whether reading is a hobby or not does not matter, there is a book that will interest you.      It is not fair to everybody to take books off the shelves of a library due to 'offensive' content. With different personalities comes different writers. With different writers comes different books. With different books comes different readers. There are a lot of people out there who like to read. What are the people who @MONTH1 like 'offensive' content going to do when these books are taken off the shelves?      Books are written for two reasons: allowing authors to express themselves and giving readers the chance to explore and relate to the imaginations of authors. I think that if a writer has the ability to put whatever he/she wants in a book, that book should be available to anyone and everyone.",3,3
4099,"Libraries are community centers. Children and adults go to libraries to check out new books that could give them new experiences and information. If libraries took out books because they were inappropriate or offensive, then young adults and adults would never recieve those new experiences. Libraries require all sorts of books to make it a qualified library. If libraries censor their books, then other materials might start vanishing as well.       Most young adults read about books that are about adventure, mystery, or love. A person could find a mystery book with a serial killer for a main character offensive, but you can't rewrite the book for one person; futhermore, take that book completely off the shelf. That book is public property. If the library took that mystery book off the shelf, then the library is taking away the experience of another young adult reading it. One teenager's thoughts do not account for other teenagers' thoughts.      Libraries that take away offensive or inappropriate books might influence other multi-billion dollar industries to second guess their work. The movie industry, for example. The movie industry might second guess the directors or actors/actresses they are hiring. Actors and actresses have a large influence on many teenagers and children. Imagine if a child's favorite actor disappeared from future movies; that child would be left without a role model. The affects of censoring books and magazines go way beyond the libraries.      Music artist might also be affected. Rappers curse and swear in their music because it is how they voice their opinions and personal experiences. For example, @ORGANIZATION1, a famous rapper. He curses in his music because it's how he shows his emotion in an event. If music publishers wouldn't publish him because his work is offensive, then he would lose his job and career. This is how people in today's society make their living; by providing entertainment to other people.      Libraries have no right to take away any books from other children and adults. Authors know what they are writing. They write it because it shows emotions and feelings. It is the same thing with music artists and screen-play writers. If movies were all about unicorns the movie industry would fall apart quickly. Libraries, as a whole, need to think about the bigger picture before they extinguish books, experiences, thoughts, and hard work",4,4
4707,"There's bad, and good books out there. Some people find different books affensive, to what they do. Other's like the books that other people dislike. In a way books are both bad and good. Good, because people start to read better after reading a lot, and bad because a lot of people dislike to read.     I think that when you go in a library there should be impropet books for people to read. Children go in library's, what if they pick up a bad book and form horriable habits? Children, and adults have very different views on what to read. Kids want to read fairytale stories, etc. Adult's on otherhand enjoy mystery storys about murder, and such.     Yes, library's can let people check out any book they find interesting; But, what if that book is bad for there children to see lying around. It's simple if you make sure you don't leave your books just lying anywhere, kid's wouldn't form bad habits, or discover anything there not suppose to know. Kid's are noises, and they will try to read your books, or see something bad on a magizine.     In library's, there is the children's section, and the adult section. That helps in some way's, but your child can still find that bad book, etc at home. Parents can keep from this for the safety of there childrens thought's, or qeustions about that certain book, etc that they found. It's good to just put thing's away when your done, and keep every bad book, etc out of your childs react.     Books are bad, and good. You can find the information you need, or something you really don't want to read about, or see. Books have stuff that we sometime's need to know, and want to know more about. If your kid finds a misleading book, make sure they didn't read it, or look at it; and just hide it away from them. In the end, the problem will be solved.",3,3
4356,I thimk kids should be abole to read what they wont. Kids should never get told no when it omes to lurning. Plus there is not a bad book that your kids will find at school any way.      Why should kids not babull to watch and read what they wont. This is how we lurn and grow. Un less it was of adult kontent. Witch would be agest the law for them to get. haha     Our kids minds are not something we should wast on things that they dont wont to read any way. When a kids starts to hate his or her work. It starts a loug chain of hateing school and the books inside it,2,2
4308,"Have you ever sondered through the libray just to specifically find that one good book, magazine, or even cd that didn't involve inapropiate material for once? You feel like a little kid in the shopping mall just inpatiently waiting to find that one toy, but it never shows up. You spend seconds, minutes, even hours still slowly pacing back and forth shelf to shelf, and finally you find it and you open it and see the most innapropriate picture ever, or maybe listen to the most vulgure language, or even take a skim through the most offensive reading yet. Do you wish it'd change?     I visit the library every time after i finish my book, I have loved reading from the time I was little. Lately i feel like my reading iterest has gone down though, not due to my act of being involved in other things, but possibly because lately I feel like every book I pick up comes off offensive. For example I went to  the check out a new book, I was mind boggled at this time because unlike usual I had no clue on which book I was even interested on to read next. The librarian directed me to there new best seller and said addressed it and said it was as hard to put down as a lollipop. I checked it out and after the first paragraph I wanted to throw up. This book and too gory and i felt like it downgraded women, I was anything but satisfied. This wasn't the first book me or my friends had checked out like this, and I have a feeling it won't be the last. I just hope i could check out a book not so offensive and actually worth my time, but it seems like lately they are all changing and becoming too much for me, and it really upsets me.     Our library seems to be over packed with magazines, which isn't a bad thing because I love them. I label magazines as a light read and very good at passing free time. I never get tired of all the pictures, all the gossip, and all the jokes at the end. Lately my opinion has changed though, these magazines are starting to alter and I don't like it. It seems as if I can't open my page without seeing a half dressed girl, some innapropriate advertisement, or even tons of personal display of affection. Seeing these vulgare images are enough to make me not only flip the page, but also never second guess about opening a magazine again.      Music is like a drug to me, and I am addicted. There is never a day that goes by that I do not listen to music, but lately music just isn't the same. I go to the library to check out some new cd's and it seems everything I bother listening to uses every curse word out there. I was furious after my purchase, but also disappointed that people actaully sell this garbage. I am somebody who listens to music to relax, not develop a new innapropriate vocabulary.      I know there are plenty of good books, magazines, and music out there. We just need to find it again. I hope that we can banish these offensive, vulgar, and unnesesary items at the library. I know i'd greatly appreciate it, and from what I heard many others would too. We want reading utensils worth reading, we want magazines our eyes won't mind to take a glance at, and we won't music that won't pollute our brains",4,4
3654,"In my opinion I believe all types of material should be allowed in libraries. If someone takes offense to a particular topic or section they dont have to read it. Not just certain types of genre and themes or magazines. Everyones different meaning they have differents personalities and views on what they like. I think libraries such actually expand thier variety of books.          Libraries that don't cater to a persons desires or interests , what would make them want to stay?  Libraries should be filled with all sorts of subjects appealing to everyone. Just like how they have an adult and children section. Everyone has a place were that feel like they belong. Even if some people get offended. A person can get offended anywhere not just by a certain magazine or some music style.      I do believe if there is a certain line of respect of course. Nothing should get to out of line were it's an issue with a numerous amount of consumers complaining about the same topic. You can tell if a certain section or material is crossing the line. Each section should be written to speak the truth but also in a respectful manner.      In the times that I've been to the library there @MONTH1 be some things that I don't agree with how certain things are certain ways. But then I see a person really enjoying their time at the library. I know when I go I always find  my style of music that appeals to me. Not just the same thing everywhere I go. Theres always a choices, different options and more things I can learn about.     Keeping all the materials like books, music, movies, etc is a way to appeal for everyone. I person should have their opinion and the choice to be able to read what they like. There will always be a certain movie or book you don't care for ,but others might. If everyone told what they like and don't like about a  certain book. Where's the variety? What books will be left? Everyone has their on thoughts on what they like, if theres a topic you don't like you probably know least about it. And the library is a good way to search and find information about anything",4,4
3408,"Every parent has their own opinion upon topics like this; but even if you were to censor out books, movies, music, etc., your child would still be allowed to find that book or movie on the internet uncensored. Yes, parents believe that having things censored will be better for their children, but children have much more technology and much more access to uncensored music.     As each day goes by the minds of children become more and more cerious as to what the world has to offer. The more parents keep there children away from things in life the more chance they have of their child sneaking out or just not being the person you thought they would be. Every person is there own person; I personally would say to just leave the books, music, movies, ect. on the shelves of libraries; children will find out anyways, wither it is from friends, or the media.     Its not to say that your child will become corrupt if listing to such music, but I believe that at a certin age parents should have talks with their children about stuff that is happening in the world, because children are not going to go be children for long and you will not be able to control them forever.     Everybody was a child at one point in time and I am pretty such that most parents very much disliked when their parents would keep them away from things they wanted to do or maybe that they wanted to see, but life aways is not fair and these are just on persons opinions.     Either way if you decide to take all the music and censor it out or if you do the same things to all the books and movies, etc. there will still be unhappy adults and unhappy parents. No matter what happens odds are is that children will find their way around these things, it never fails. There will always be some way your child can get around you, always going to be some way your kids will get past your rules; just think about it, if they disobay you once they will most likely do it again. It is in a child's nature.     So like I said before every parent and every person has their own opinion upon topics like such, me personally I say just leave it and lets the parents of these children handle it the way they would like to, because yoy can not please everybody.",3,3
4388,"A curious child goes into the library for the first time to find a story to read. Yet, when she goes to the children's section, the book she wants is not allowed in this library becuase it is said to promote certain ideals to children. The child goes to her older sister for help to find a different book. The older sister is to busy looking for her own book. She had walked into the library looking to find answers to her questions over a liberal topic. She can't find the book she wants, the library has censored it.      Why would we censor librairies if we have the freedom of the press and the freedom of speech? It is not right to censor libraries becuase that is restricitng what is allowed to be read, which is taking away part of our freedom. The press is allowed to print anything, and we the people read it. Will that be the next thing that is censored? A book is just like the newspaper, it is relaying a story to entertain the auidence that is reading it.      By censoring libraires that is taking away the freedom of speech. Writing is a way to express yourself. Authors share there expressions through writing, hoping they can touch someone else's life and be of some assistance. Whether the book helps its reader to escape a horrendus day or to answer the questions of a curious teenager. I use books daily to escape the stresses of life, the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' series gave me something to do and allowed me to use my imagination and mind, I could escape into another world and leave my chores behind me.      Some @MONTH1 say that offensive things should be censored. In our culture the slightest thing can called 'offensive' now. If we never learn about these 'offensive' things how would we understand history? There will always be rude things that have been said, but we should be exposed to them so we can learn from it. By censoring these items we will never learn and  neither will our children about other cultures, history, or liberal ideas.      Instead of censoring items, there is another solution. Make certain items restricted and red flagged. If certain items become restricted; it would mean that people over a certain age are allowed to read them. By doing this a child's mind would not be polluted, but we could still be exposed to different ideas and learn from them. If there was a system to red flag an item, this would allow the reader to know that this item contains what could be considered offensive material so they do not have to expose their selves to it if they did not want to, but others could. This would work becuase the books could stay in the library and still be used but there would be a warning system for those who do not want to be around it or allow their children to be around it.      In conclusion censoring libraries is a bad idea. It takes away our freedom of the press and speech.We are also making ourselves ignorant this way. If we put out a warning system it is fair to everyone. The 'offensive' matterial can stay in the libaries but people will know ahead of time what they are being exposed to and what their children are to",4,4
3113,"I dont believe books should be takin off of the shelves for being offensive. Some books that are found offensive by one person might not offend another. People @MONTH1 have the right to say that a book is offensive if that is how they feel, but they do not have the right to deny others the right to read that book. I understand that parents want to protect children. Parents should talk to their children and explain to them why they dont want them reading that specific book. Parents might also just let their children read it and explain why they don't approve.      I feel the same way about the censorship of music and movies. When I was twelve years old i started to listen to music that I enjoyed instead of the music my mother played. My mother was concerned about the lyrical content of the songs i would listen to. She refused to buy me the music and would not let me listen to it. I went to my friends houses and listed to explicit music and watched rated @CAPS1 movies. She could never really stop me because that explicit language was being said wherever I went.     I think instead of trying to deny teenagers the music the parents should explain why and let them make the decision. I think censorship should be left up to the parents of that child. Sometimes when parents try to pull their kids closer they actually push them away. That's why I think it's so important for the parent and the child to always talk and be comfortable",3,3
4769,"I believe that certain materials should not be removed from the shelves due to censorship.Different sections in the libary should be offerd.Everyone has differnt oppions on what they like to read or watch.You should do what you want at your own risk.I think the censorship should not affect the libary.      The libary should offer differnt sections, therefore a kids side, a teenage side, and an adult side. The kids side should offer books that only kids should see by age group.The kids should not have to worry about censorship becuase they should not be offered any thing that an libarian would not want them to see and they should only be able to checkout things from their side of the libary.     A teen side should not have censorship because alot of kids know many things that they should not so it would not effect them as much.Books that teengers read are most likely to have foul language and inapropiate things. Teenagers when they read or see things does not really influenece them as much. Music that teenagers listen to they already know what most of the songs are talking about so why offer only censored music at libraries? Why would you want to try to remove something when it is already known?   An adult side should not have censorship, adults should be able to read, watch, and look at mostly anything.Adults are the ones who see it and heard it all. It would be pointless to get rid of things on the sheleves.. They already know of allot of things. Why get rid of books that others @MONTH1 read. It is a libary so it should just offer things that would increase intellegence not decrease it.     The censorship is pointless, you should do what you want at your own risk.Things in movies,books,magazines are that are of the world. Why try to block out negative things when there all around you. If someone finds something affensive then let it be there are many things affensive in today's society.You pick up what you want to read and make the choice on your own. If your capable of reading it or if it is the right decision check it out.You enter the libary at your own risk and choose what criteria or selection your going to choose.     The libary is full of differnt oppions and allot of differnt likes and dislikes.If you should not be looking at something then it is your oppion to take what you want out of it. Everyone enjoys differnt things like, movies,books, magazines, and music. If the libary had a censorship they would loose allot of matrials all due to oppions of people that did not care about others oppions.Everyone enjoys differnt things and wants a wide varitey of the things they like. The libary is where you go when you need  books, movies, and etc. Why close someones oppion of  book selections, what if that is the only type of selection, or book they like to read.     I believe that the censorship should not affect the libary.The libary should offer differnt sections  for certain age groups.The books and magazinges and music at the libary should all be at your own risk to checkout them. Everyone has differnt oppions at the libary. The censorship would be a bad decison if they did go through with this decison.. The libary would not offer as many things and most liekly less things would be getting checkedout. Therefore I do think that the cenosorship should not remove books on the shelves at libraries",3,3
3744,"I dont think that music, magazines, books, or movies should be removed from the shelf because if some people dont like it some other people might find it intertaining than what other people do.

I mean everyone has the right to know about what is going on or what happened years and years ago. I mean it is all put out there to be seen not hidden from eople because people want others to know what has happened even if they take  it the wrong way.     I would rather my children know about everything so they know what is wrong and what is right. There is some stuff out there in books, magazines, and ect. that shoouldnt be seen or heard of but people listen and read it all the time no matter what it is. Schools teach children about almost anything does that mean schools should be shut down? No!     Some people homeschool their kids for that reason ,but do they think about when they go out in public what people say or do? I dont think so, there is really no reason that if people take it offensive about something they read or listen to.     There is no reason for people to take it off the shelf if they dont like it because other people will and they will buy it just to listen or to read something. People need to realize that there is stuff everywhere that people dont want their children hearing but they hear it anyway. It is just hoe our economy is these days.",3,3
4103,"Libraries contain many helpful and entertaining materials for people of all ages. Some @MONTH1 argue that a library holds documents that are offensive and should not be put on the shelf, but I beg to differ. A library holds many books, magazines, movies, etc. that can advance the knowledge of citizens.      Libraries can, and probably do, contain materials that are guilty of being offensive, but they shouldn't be taken off the shelf because of this. Instead, libraries should be divided into sections based on topics. If a parent doesn't want their child to read a book based on racism, then the parent simply keeps the child out of that section.     How will children learn about what goes on in @LOCATION1 if they are not shown? Children won't know how to cope with the harsh realities of the world unless they are exposed to them early. This doesn't mean that a child should be shown a magazine highlighting @PERSON2's next drug scandal, but showing them that stuff like this does go on and you should not live that way.      Libraries don't contain material that is offensive without a reason. What if a high school student is doing a report on the rise of teen-pregnancy? This student should have no better source for information than a library. The library would be the most trustworthy documentation of facts about this topic.      These books that a library holds are not only there to educate us, but to entertain us as well. If a library removes a biography on the rapper, @ORGANIZATION1, because he has a 'rocky past', they @MONTH1 lose one client who came to the library to be amazed by the struggles that many successful people have overcome to get where they are today.      As Katherine Paterson said, 'And then we have no books on the shelf for any of us.' If a library censors all of the material that goes throught the system, there @MONTH1 not be any books left to entertain ourselves. Therefore, libraries should not monitor what material is put on the shelf.",4,4
3390,"I believe that all the uncensored books, movies, music, and magazines in a library should be taken off the shelves and put into a single room in the library and be labeled as the @CAPS1 @CAPS2.     The children that go into the library at most libraries have a space where its just kids books but when the kids go with their parents or someone that is older up to the teenager and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 they dont know what they are looking at when they just pick up a random book off of the shelf and/or rack.      Some people @MONTH1 think that it shouldn't be like that because they are weary of who might see them go into a little room marked @CAPS1 @CAPS2. However, if you don't want anyone to see you go into that room you just simply don't go in it.      So by secluding the @CAPS1 books, magazines, videos, etc. you can keep the children from just picking up any book that has uncensored pictures or grabbing a video that the parents @MONTH1 not look at and end up being an @CAPS1 film and then the kid then might want to keep seeing the stuff like that when he reaches puberty he will be eager to have sexual entercourse with a boy/girl.      Having said that, i hope that you see how my idea of sectioning off the @CAPS1 stuff will keep them out of the @CAPS1 stuff and keep them from having sexual entercourse at as early of an age as thirteen.     As far as music goes, there really isn't a way to completely keep kids from listening to music such as rap that has foul language and it sometimes talks about having sex and drugs and the kids think that the artist who wrote the song made it to be a big shot and they did drugs and had sex and look how they turned out. The best way, in my eyes, to keep kids from listening to rap is for their parents to not let them listen to it while they are with them. However, the other music like @CAPS5 @CAPS6 and @CAPS7 or even hip-hop rarely has any references to the topics of rap music.      I could also argue that parents should watch out for their kids to be aware of the consequences of some of the actions they take due to these reasons and they should take the action of diciplining the kids for their actions",3,4
3702,From what I seen in my life about censorship is that they should not take stuff off of the shelf just because of its content.  I think that libraries should keep the thing in the shelves but seperated from the rest if found offensive.  It's bad enough that everybody is offended by the smallest thing which makes it difficult for everybody else to enjoy it.  I think that we should not even censor the content because I feel like that is making people wanting to know why they censored it in the first place.          My personal opinion is that censorship is useless because it ruins it for everybody because one person got offended.  I like the saying sticks and stones @MONTH1 break my bones but words will never hurt because it says if your offended then get over it.  Why should your opinion speak for everyone else.  Another reason why I believe that we shouldn't censor things is if someone really wants to know they could always find a way to get it so the censorship thing is kind of pointless.  I also feel like censorship is making people soft because everything is censored and when people get into the real world they get hit hard.          My conclusion is that they should seperate the stuff that is offensive and put it in another section of the library.  They could also develop a rating system like they do in video games so you know what kind of content is in it.  Simple stuff like this can make everyone happy because the person who is offended doesn't have look at the stuff that he hates.,3,3
4591,"All of the materials in a library shold have to be check out of the library before anyone can take them out of the library. Which the librarian should make sure that anything that goes out of the library should have to be checked out before a student can take the materials out of the library. the topics that are going to be talked about are: why materials have to be checked out of the library, what happens if you do not check out the materials, and what happens if you lose the materials that you check out of the library.     Materials that the library has is for everyone to check out if they want to check anything out of the library. So, then the librarian will be able to tell a student if they want a book, music, movie, magazine, ect., the librarian can tell the student if the material is in or is checked out of the library. Then, the student will be able to check out the material or can ask the librarian to hold the material when it comes back in for the student. Then, the whole school can be running smoothly senice the librarian can keep track of the materials that is in the library.     If you do not check out the materials that lis in the library nobody will be able to see where the materials are at. Which, if you checked out materials out of the library the librarian can track it down for you. So, if you do not check it out the librarian will not be able to track down any of the material that is in the library. So, then the librarian can not tell a student where the materials are at and then the materials is out of the library and noone can check it out. Then, the librarian has to wait til the person that took the materials out of the library brings the materials back to the library so that it will be able to be check out by the person that wanted it when it was out of the library.     If you check something out of the library and you lose it you will have to pay for it. When you lose something from the library, that means that noone will be able to check it out until it eithers gets returned or you have to pay the librarian the money for a new one. Then the next person that wanted it will have to wait even longer to get the lmaterials because you lost the libraries copy of the materials that you check out. Then the librarian will have to make sure that the next person that wanted the materials will be able to get it when ever it came back in the library. Then, the person that lost the material should not be able to check anything out of the library anymore thay can only sit in the library to reas the materials that they either want to read or have to read for a project for a grade for one of their classes. Also, if you do not check the materials out of the library, and you lose it the the librarian will not be able to track down the materials for anyon that wants it so the check it out.     These are just some of the many reasons why you have to check out materials from the library. There is alot more reasons you hve to check out materials from the library. So, then the librarian will be able to keep up with all of the materials that is in the library, and any person can check out any material that they either want or need for a class and it does not have to stay in the library when ever you want it",3,3
4243,"In my way of viewing things i say that what i think is that the book, movies, music, and magazines should be put in critical order because some of us want or like to read or see stuff about what we want to see like the news that are in one way good to us, but some others like to see what's behind from the reality and want to speak up but they can because they are afraid that they would get hurt for speaking up. So i think that those things(books, music, movies, magazines) should not be removed from the shelfs because those books or movies can bring you what's going on in the world and how is affecting us in the way of not paying attention to it. Some experiences that i have is music i had once heard a song in spanish called '@CAPS1 The @CAPS2' and it talks about the corruption in @LOCATION1 and that how the people from the bottom suffer because of the people from the top do not care about them, also if you treat them as kings they will treat you as a slaves, and that if you give them the @CAPS2 to control you, they will take out advantage of it, how the honest people work hard to bring food to their homes, but its not enough because of the leaders on top that want all for them... its a very good song that says the true about it and that nobody does something to finished.So i don't want that songs or books that show the reality disapper because some people doesn't like them at all",3,3
4549,"What I belive is that certain material should be allowed on a shelf. The time it takes an author to write a book, is very long. It could be their passion to write, so why would you want to take that away. Every person has an opinion, which is allowed to have by freedom. Material in libraries are sorted by age group, and as long as the material is fitted for that age group, there should'nt be a problem.      There are many books that some people do not want their children to read, but the books actually help children learn. For example, a book that you think is boring could actually be interesting to another person. There are many opinions in the world, that is why there are so many differnt kinds of books. If you took away a book or certain material off the shelf, how could that help a child. Yes it could have bad words or beliefs, but it could help someone. If a person is a loner or just likes to be by them selves, they could learn from the character's mistake in the book.           Many children these days are getting bullied or pick on, and don't want to tell an adult. If there was a book that they read about a person being bullied, maybe it would encourage them to tell a teacher. Yes I agree, every material has something in it that another person does not like. There are a couple books that I did not approve of, myself, but I know that it has connected with a child some where in the world. Every person does not grow up in the same conditions, but material could teach them.      You should stop and think if you was a writer, would you want someone to throw your hard work in the trash? Every time there is a big rally about an author writing about a certain belief, there is negative thoughts. No one stops and thinks about someone else or their family. All they care about is their own family. Even the author's family is embarassed of the rally, but no one stops and thinks of their family and how they feel.      Think about you opinion, does anyone care about what you think? That is why as a person, we should not bring down someone's opinion, and let them say what they believe on paper. How would you like it, if someone threw your belief or opinion in the trush? If there is a rally about a material in the library, next time think before you judge. Would you want someone judging your belief or opinion?",3,4
4257,"Libraries are a center of learning. They are there to provide all kinds of different information. So why should you take out offensive material? Even before internet, the all knowing source, people depended on the libarary for research. I do not think that things should be taken out of our library. Public libraries have always had a good censory about @CAPS1 they put on their shelves anyway.     As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have a right to remove that book from the shelf, that work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 she is saying there is, everybody has a certain opinion, they @MONTH1 take offense to different things. Therefore, if anyone could have the right to take a book off the shelf that they found offensive, then we wouldn't have any books on our shelves.     If we would travel back to the time where internet was not invented, there would not be a problem on whether we should take certain books off the shelf. That's all they depended on. For example, research and entertainment. People today are spoiled. We can go right to a little screen and type in anything we want to know and we can find out just in mintues, sometimes even seconds. People don't even have to leave the house to go buy the latest movie that just came out, you can order it on the internet or even rent it from @ORGANIZATION1. If people are so worried about @CAPS1 is in the library, why don't they worry about all the explicit junk on the internet. Sometimes people can't see @CAPS1's right in front of them.     Everytime I go to the library and look through the books to find something to read, I rarely find a book that's worth questioning. Libraries are typically wholesome corporations, they have a good censory on @CAPS1 they let on their shelves. They've always had certain age group sections, and usually people and kids always stick to their age groups. Every book I have choosen too, I've read it cover to cover.     In conclusion, libraries have been around for ever. Their material provides research and appropriate entertainment for all ages. No matter if we ever had internet, we always had dependable libraries.",4,4
4476,"I feel that a person has the right to go to a liberay and get a book, magazine, moive, and whatever else they might because someone could use the material for infomatin they @MONTH1 need. I however do feel that is should be handled maturly, @CAPS1 kept in a special area or somewhere a child or person that should not have material about anything unuseful to them. I think if it is something for an adult only them there sould be no way of a child getting ahold of it.     A person does have a right i feel to go to the libery and get whatever book they @MONTH1 need for personal infomation to help themself to for resherch paper they need infomation on. Anyting inapporatie should have it's own spot away from anyting else.      As i have mentioned I do feel that there should be some protection for childern number one, who do not to be reading about something over there head, and two for someone who doesn't really need that infomation to help  them get infomation about someting.          I think there is many things that can help prevent someone form feeling like the libery need censorship number one would be have a special room just for things that are deemed inapportiate to someone which leads me to my next point there should be a worker just for determing in something should be kept in a specail room. I think there defanilty should be a certian age to enter a room for uncensored materials. If they do not meet the requirments dont let them in. I do think in some cases then they should have to say why they want that certain material just to determine it is for all the right reasons.      As i have menioned I do feel that everyting should be allowed because is could be needed by someone for person infomation, or a classroom prompt that needs infomation. But I also do feel that there should be some rules and requirments as to what is apportiate and what is not. If that person has a legitament reason for needed something i don't see the harm of them getting what they need",3,3
4443,"Every individual has their own opinion on censorship. Some people believe that, in some instances, it is perfectly fine, but others disagree. I'm one person that thinks that, in some instances, things should be censored.       Schools have the right to censor what is put in their libraries for their students to read, especially magazines. Some of the magazines out there have articles in them that arent appropriate for school hours or even in the school building. Schools @MONTH1 not want something inapropriate on their shelves where students can see it. Censorship is even more understandable in elementary schools. Younger students' libraries should be monitored even more carefully. Younger kids, such as elementary age, don't really know what they should and shouldn't read.     In public libraries, things are a little different. Parents can usually monitor what their kids check out. Most adults know to read the summary on the back of the book to know what is being checked out. If the summary is too vague, then they know to read a few pages inside the book.     A couple of times, I've gone to the public library and I checked out a book that I thought was a suspense. When I got home and began reading it, it turned out I was wrong. The book was a romance book that I didn't care to read. So, I returned the book to the library. Most of the time you can read the synopsis on the back of the book, but that doesn't always reveal too much about the book. So, the best thing you can do is read a couple of pages out of the book before you check it out.    Everyone has a right to their own opinion on censorship. I believe that in some instances things available to be checked out should be censored. In other instances, things should be left up to the adults and the parents to decided what they want to be allowed  to checked out.",4,4
3517,"Do you think there are certain books and magazines that should not be displayed in librarys? Well here's my perspective.      I think that librarys shouldn't have certain books due to racism, violence, and etc. One, because there are young children that read books throughout the library, and two because books and magazines due to racism and ect. can be offensive to others.      How would you feel about your children reading about stuff like that? That's something a child doesn't need to know at an early age. So that's my perspective on it",2,2
3750,"Should certain material found to be offensive be removed from the shelves of our library? Many people find material they see in libraries such as books, movies, music, magazines, etc., to be offensive; but does that mean that they should be removed? I believe along with many others that libraries should not censor out offensive materials. To censor libraries would neglect parent responsibilities, destroy our profitable media, and be unconstitutional.      Parents are responsible for their children, not only when it comes to providing food and shelter, but also when their children are viewing inappropriate or offensive material. If you do not want your child to be offended or see vulgar shows, texts, and music, do not let them see it. For instance, if a child is listening to a sexual song on their I-pod take it from them. It is not a right to have the device it is a privelage and parents are aloud to take away privelages.     In addition to neglecting the parent's responsibilities, it would be a gigantic blow to the media economically. Most media is viewed, because of the inappropriate material appearing in their shows, books, and music. If you censor all of that material out less movie tickets will be bought, less books will be sold, and less music will be listened to. In a time of recession, like the one we are currently coming out of it is more beneficial to provide as much income as possible, instead of destroying current oppurtunities for profit.      Both of these points are valid, but most importantly censoring libraries would be unconstitutional. In the preamble we are given rights to the freedom of speech and press. These offensive materials are included in this right. I understand admentments can be added to specify what type of speech and press is appropriate, but how will officers monitor that. Not to mention all the jail space that would be needed for people smuggling inappropriate material to buyers.      In brief censoring libraries is a bad idea in the areas of parent responsibilities, media economics, and our constitutional rights. When negatively effecting all of these areas the consequences are much more influential then the benefits. Obviously censoring is not the answer to offensive material",4,5
4465,"This writing is socially unacceptable! There are many books and media sources, that include: lauguage, sexual tones, and other immoral things and ideas. However culture does need to be obtained, although immorally on this earth is at an all-time high,we need to stop focusing on books that will always be on the sheves and turn our attention to people's hearts, and turn to morally right things.     When a person walks into a library, @CAPS8 or she can expect certain things, for example: the smell of the older books, the noise of a group of kids, and the yelling of the librarian to keep them quiet.What @CAPS8 or she would not expect is: kids doing drugs, and watching porn on the computers. This is not a book's fault or 'the evil computers' fault. This is the fault of an immoral world.     I myself have witnessed some evil things kids do in the school system and it gets worst everyday, there is good, but it certainly is not because they themselves are caring and loving about what they do on this planet. I can quote from many, in my @NUM1 grade class that have told me 'The only thing that is wrong, is telling someone they are'. This thought process is immoral. But who is going to tell them that, and what is the answer.     @CAPS2 is the answer, in the @CAPS1 it says, @CAPS2 is the way, the truth, and the life.This is truth. In the book of @CAPS3 it says, @CAPS4 gave many people over to their sinful passions. @CAPS4 is the only good, and the only light comes from @CAPS5. The only man to live a perfect life was @CAPS2 @CAPS7 and @CAPS8 was @CAPS4 in a human body. we as a planet need to turn to @CAPS5, the only good thing. And try to be like @CAPS5, because this world needs @CAPS5.     Only @CAPS4 can change a heart. We need the focus on @CAPS5, once we do that, the way we think, and the way we write, and the way we act, will change and we will not need to disgust this problem any longer",4,3
4005,"People that walk the surface of our planet sometimes feel the need to have something banned or atleast get some dirt on it to make people think less of it. It is just the way our world works when it comes to something you just can't stand, but why even bother, just what exactly are they going to get out of it? If someone took the time to make it then we all deserve the right to view it. I do not agree on censorship in our world.     Local libraries are a very nice place to go for books, movies, and information. How is this to be such a good resource for people once everything is gone, especially considering some of the worlds greatest books ever written are the ones that are targeted by censorship. I believe Katherine Paterson has a very valuable point in saying, 'Then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' because it is true. People don't stop at just one, once something is gone they will continue hunting for things that they just hate, which will lead to people suffering from not being able to enjoy the things they want.     When I was younger, I remember going to the library all the time for @CAPS1 movies and books. I personally got to actually see a book be removed because of censorship, although I did not fully understand, I felt that if I read it, I would get grounded. Which is also not good for kids because they shouldn't be scared to read something. We live in a place with the freedom of speech, but yet that right seems to be fading away. There's still more ways to see censorship and how it affects the libraries though, such as actually reading about some of the cases that have tried to ban books.     Although most fail to be banned right now, the world is very unpredictable. In school there have been many times where kids got the chance to read case after case about people trying to get some of the best books banned. Which is funny how those books are the only books that were fun to read during the school year. So that doesn't make sense on why to take them off the shelves. Reading is what keeps us informed, on the past and even the future.     'Then we have no books left.' if this is what people wish for then keep at it, but if there is some sort of decency in you, I would imagine when it comes to making an easy choice like this, you too would choose the right one. Saying no to censorship. Reading is what keeps us strong, entertained, and those who know the past are not likely to repeat it, unless books are gone.",4,4
4631,"Many people have different views on censorship. Some people believe there are movies, books, newspapers, etc that contain subject matter that is not appropriate for some viewers and that they should keep their writing on certain things to a certain extent or not at all. Other people believe people have the right to say what they want when they want, on a topic they believe the be true or not true, or very improtant to them, also called freedom of speech. Also people believe that yes, there are some things written out there that should not have been written but they have no control over and to some people it @MONTH1 be appropriate.      I do believe there are stories written that are not appropriate. But I know that even though I find the subject to not be appropriate or of any use to me, another person will. I know that every person out there is different and has their own beliefs on different things. If people had the power to control what books, magazines, newspapers and movies were in libraries then @PERSON1 was right, 'We would have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.           Certain books, newspapers, movies, and magazines could help certain people and be of interest to certain people no matter what the subject is or how inappropraite it @MONTH1 be as long as they are along the right age. If the story is plainly about drugs, sex, alcohol, and voilence with really no use to it, then yes I do believe it should be taken off the shelf. You do not know who could get their hands on that movie, book, or article. It could be a little kid and we do not want to open the door for that. People have many different beliefs and I do believe we should not take anything off the shelf that could be of use to anyone, but I also do believe there is a certain extent.",3,3
3359,"I think that if u feel like they are sayin bad thing that you should not read the books or magazines and dont lisen to the music and dont look at the moves.          If you feel offensive about it just dont look at it because a porson might not find it offensive.It is port of life to look at something offensive so why do it now. I think that if they do that they might just take some @CAPS1.Vs shows off the air becuas there are a lot off shows out there that are offensive and some do not like that but they dont take it off the air so why take books music, movies, and magazines off the shelves.    i dont believe that they should do that at all becuas if i dont like it i dont look at it so i dont get mad at something somebody say bout my believe.    A porson might not like the same music u like i might not like the same music he or she likes but i dont wont to take it off the shelves they should just stop lookin and lisning to all this stuff a porson says about there believe.",2,2
2992,"When talking about censorship in libraries, I don't think the people that work in the libraries should decide what goes on the shelves. The people of the community should have a say on what goes on the shelves, because their the ones thats going to the library anyway.                 I believe that everybody is intitle to their own opinion, but I think certain materials should be removed.  For example, some music could be offensive; therefore, I'm not saying that music shouldn't be totally removed from libraries. I'm saying the offensive music should be removed",3,2
3164,"People think that graphic images or words are going to change the outlook there younger child has on alot of topics. But really the kids wont remember half of what they read or see so does it really matter? Well according to some people it does which i can understand but i will have to go with the side that it does'nt matter to. Becasue its not like there not going to find out about bad language or sex so i say there should be no restrictions on books, music, movies, magazines, tv shows, ect.     The fact of the matter is that people or parents get to offended or complain cause there little @PERSON1 said a curse word in front of them. Or becasue some of the material in the show or magazines are to offensive towards people with disabilities, races, ect. When really all of this is just humor none of it is the network or authors being serious. Authors works arent to be shunned apon but to be read and for people to learn from that book or just have a good time reading it.     Through all of this you should know by now that i don't think that books should be taken off the shelf just becasue little kids parents are ashamed of what there kid read. Casue like i already said there are gonna find out about this stuff eventually. So no need getting mad over it. And if we got rid of all the more mature books what  kind of books would all of us more mature kids and people have to read. Casue im pretty sure i dont want to read about a magical friendly dragon finding its way home.",3,3
3300,"Censorship in liraries, in my opinion is over-rated. Everywhere you hear of book, music, magazines, and movies being offensive or degrading, but does that mean that they should be taken off the shelves of our public libraries, or out of book stores? I say no because, future generations need to know of the material, it @MONTH1 not always be offensive, and the public libraries have no right to tell us what we can, and cannot read.     Some say that our future generations will be greatly shorted of knowledge, or become naive because of this lack of knowledge. I say this is because of the censorship in libraries. Katherine paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other chilren have taken off the shelf. But if i have the right to remove that book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. An then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' So if they're taking books off the shelve because they find them offensive, then there will be so many books gone, that the kids will not have a broder view as so many people are lucky to have today.     Everyone has a different oppinion about everything, including what's offensive and what's not. If one person see's a book as being offensive, that doesn't necessarily mean that someone else will also. I've heard of teachers not letting the students see pictures of The @CAPS1, because the think it's offensive. Not everyone agrees with that. The @CAPS1 is a big part in history and it being catorgorized as offensive is wrong, it's not the only thing in history that is bad. If they start taking out big parts of history, it will be long lost and forgotten.     Lastly i believe that the libraries should not be able to tell us what we can and cannot read. We have the right to choose what we want to read, if we think that it's bad and shouldn't be reading it, then we won't read it. But that doesn't mean they should take out the book because one person finds it offesive. Someone else might want to read it. I think that people are mature enough to pick what they read, and as for children their parents are the one's that could pick for them.     With so many different oppinions it's hard to decide what to do about censorship, I believe that if it's offensive maybe they should have a special section for explicit media and reading. Maybe then people wouldn't be offended by it. Just because one person doesn't like it doesn't mean another wouldn't either.",4,4
3084,"Do you believe certain books should be removed from the shelf because they are offensive? From my point of view yes, because libraries are public which means they are open to any and everyone. Kids could see a photo that @MONTH1 not be appropriate for them, people of different religion could hear foul language, and it could give some libraries a bad image. I can relate to this because I have also heard some things that I am not proud of such as foul language. That effected me because when I heard it I went around people who were positive in my life saying it to them.     Of course, this could effect a child in a negative way. Kids grow up to be as positive as they can, atleast thats what parents teach them and if they get hooked on things they see they will try to immitate it. From my experience it did not turn out so good because my mother believed in physical discipline. But if a child is not taught that those things have bad effects they will learn the hard way. This is a reason I wish censorship was in our local libraries.     Also, people of different religion could find it offensive. We have different consumers that walk in and out of the library everyday, so when they enter they should find it peacful not the opposite. For example a muslim could walk in the library and here others listening into music with nothing but profanity. Now that person has the right to report that person who was listening to it and he can say the library has no restrictions. At times it is okay to want a book that has a few bad words but the library needs to know their limits.     Then, the library has a bad image which is a big problem. When something gets a bad look sooner or later it will not be there anymore. Meaning consumers will stop going to that library and one thing could lead to another. For example when you leave the library the people that work there want you to come back and tell other people about their library. But if problems constantly happen there they will leave and tell their friends this is not a good library. Then those figures add up then finally you struck out and it's gone.          Now, if they are not removed this is what can happen. Children will immitate what they see or heard, complaints will be filed on that library. If I had a problem with the restriction levels at the library I just would stop going. And if that library can not help it atleast have the courtesy to mark the sections of the library. This will make sure we will know what we are about to see and read",3,3
4725,"Censorship in libraries is a big argument today. Many people wonder what is considered 'appropriate' for our children. With several @CAPS3 and @CAPS2 factors these days it is hard to find something that is not offensive to ones culture. Three main reasons we are not able to find a book reasonable, yet non-offensive for our children in libraries includes @CAPS1, @CAPS2 beliefs, and @CAPS3 beliefs.      @CAPS1 was a big deal in the late @NUM1's to early @DATE1's. Thanks to @LOCATION2, slavery became illegal in the @LOCATION1. Although, there are still many racist comments, articles, and films published today. If someone does not stop the harsh comments, then it @MONTH1 never stop. Even though it is not such a big deal today, that doesn't mean it won't continue to happen. Children do not need to see or hear racist comments made toward their race like many of their ancestors did.      Harsh put-downs and comments toward @CAPS2 beliefs are also inappropriate for the society, let alone for children to read. Books containing this are not considered appropriate for children and need to be placed in a different section of the library. As a teenage reader, my biggest belief and interest is learning about other cultures to see what it would be like to live in another country.      There are countless religions in the world today, many of which are accustomed by their own god(s). I belief it is of a great cause for children of the modern day world to celebrate their own religion how they would like. However, I believe it is not right to make hateful opinions toward other religions. This is also a thing that yet children have the ability to read about. Children should not be reading about fictious facts of religions and making the thought process in their head when they assume something is true about that religion when it is not. It is definitely a great idea to stick those materials in the @NUM2 section.      For now, children should be receiving material that they can easily comprehend and find interesting. It would be a great idea to make a fiction section appropriate for kids and then a @NUM2 section for kids and/or adults. An idea to take into consideration is that every local public library could have a meeting to decide whether to keep the library in easy-access form or not. That is for you to decide!",4,4
4615,"Communities have many different types of people that live in them. Certain groups of people find some things offensive while others find them totally nomal. Some of these things cause conflict. A library, for example, is one place you @MONTH1 find some of these conflicts.     Most libraries are open to the public. Therefore, many different groups of people will be sharing the material in the library such as books, movies, magazines, and music. Having many different kinds of people sharing this material, the libraries must try to have material to please everyone. This is where the conflict begins. While trying to please everyone, some people @MONTH1 find some of the material offensive. Now for the big question: Should material some find offensive be removed from the shelves all together?     The answer to this big question is no. Libraries must have many different kinds of materials in them to please everyone in the community. People are different and believe in different things. Just because one person finds some type of material offensive doesn't mean it is offensive to everyone. For example, things such as religion. Someone @MONTH1 find a book on a type of religion and find it very offensive, but others @MONTH1 strongly believe in that reigion. Just because one person takes it offensively, doesn't mean those who don't should have it taken away from them.     Libraries are for all kinds of people. Just because one person finds the material offensive, doesn't mean it should be taken away from everyone else. If libraries took any material that anyone found offensive in any way off the shelves, there would be no material left. People believe in different things. That is the way it always has been and more than likely, the way it will always be",3,4
3041,"There are many books that are offensive to people. I personally agree. There are many things that shouldn't be seen by children.There is alot of material out there, weather its books, movie, and other things that have a bad influences on children. Children learn by watching and observing. They learn from us and our generation. What better way to protect them than by removing their bad influences.     First, children watch movies and they see to people kissing and one thing leads to another. Some movies even show people having sex. What kind of influence is that on the children. Than the children learn and they go out there and do the same thing. Teen pregnacies have jumped threw the roof. High @CAPS1 are filled with pregnant teens. Any where you go I garentee you will see a pragnant teen. Some girls even get pragnant right after they have developed and were able to have kids. Now imagine if we were able to stop that. Theres a way; dont let the children watch these programs, that way they won't be tempted.     Secondly, there are books and movies and other things that show the children shooting and killings and how people get away with it. This could be a very bad influence. There are video games with shootings and have limbs flying all over the place. Well the children will learn from those video games and movies. They think that killing someone is ok and you can get away with it. Bad influences like that make the children think it's ok to do things like that.There have been children who have killed their parents for a video game. Then the children become cereal killers or go on a shooting spry at school. Is that not much evidence at all to show the people that something is wrong. We need to take imediate control of this situation and stop it before one day you see your child on television for killing someone.        Finally, all the children are getting lazier. All children do is lay down and watch tv or play video games. Their lazyness causes obesity. Their are many kids to whom this topic refers to. No parent wants to see their kid over weight for many reasons. Children being obeast causes lots of depression. The child feels sad because they feel ugly and they lose self esteem. Thechild then becomes shy and quiet. In some cases the child trys to comit suicide because otherchildren are teasing them in school everyday. I know any parent wouldn't want their kid to die. These are things that are happening and parents need to open their eyes and see whats happening before its to late.      In conclusion, to prevent all these catastrophies their has to be change. Their are many harmful and bad influences out their today that can determine the childrens futures. There still time for change, so lets do something about it. Lets try to reduce teen pregnancies, bad influencial video games or movies, and instead of watching movies and playing video games all day get up go outside and go for a walk. These are little things we can do to make a change for good",4,4
3873,"Censorship in @ORGANIZATION1 has been around for as long as their has been the various mediums of art. In many cases the censorship @CAPS9 of what many would agree as not suitable material for anyone to create and enjoy. But then in other more serious issues that the censor has deemed not suitable for a certain audience, or even to a whole country. What @CAPS9 it that gives a select few the right to ban any given number of imaginative creations, even if they are in some aspects more lued in nature?     Censorship has and @CAPS9 still a very usefull tool that many governments employ to accomplish a wide variety of tasks, considered to ensure the 'safety' of both our minds and bodies. Some of the more widely know cases of this most despicable tactic of control come from the countries of @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @LOCATION3, @LOCATION4R, @CAPS3 @LOCATION5, and @LOCATION2. In these countries all materials that are deemed potentially hazardous to the wellfare of the @ORGANIZATION2 are heavily policed and in many cases destroyed. The most noteworthy instances of this occured in @LOCATION3, where the @CAPS4 would gather up large amounts of books from the people and burn them in massive rallies. The people were so enthralled by the @CAPS5 leadership that they would often times freely relenquish their books with no resistance, and in some cases join in and throw the books in themselves. The same thing @CAPS9 still occuring in @LOCATION5 today, wtih a censor still on their internet surfing possibilities. In @DATE1 the popular search engine @ORGANIZATION3 attempted to set up shop in the country, but quickly entered into dispute with the @ORGANIZATION2 about the censoring of certain materials. Some months after the argument began over the censoring of @LOCATION5's people, the company completely removed all bans for a short time, much to the dismay of the @ORGANIZATION2. During that time it @CAPS9 reported that some of the main search topics were that of many social reformers and of different religions than that of the @ORGANIZATION2's sanctioned religion. But the one country that takes the cake for having the most censorship @CAPS9 @LOCATION2, they're @ORGANIZATION2 has restricted and policed any technology in the country. The common people live in a so called '@CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8'.     In our home country of the @LOCATION1 we are promised many rights to protect our freedom as citizens. We are promised the freedom of speech as well as press, and in censoring our libraries they would restrict both. If we do not stand up and protect our rights, then who will? Are we not a @ORGANIZATION2 for the people, by the people? Why are we allowing the censorship of our own intellectual creations in a place that was created to provide access to said materials for those who are less fortunate, so they themselves can gain knowledge and understanding. If we as a people were to allow such a blatent restriction on our given freedoms, then we are in no position to have them in the first place. Our country was founded and later almost torn apart by the men and women who were willing to risk it all in order to protect their freedoms in this country. Are we descendants of those same people? If so why should we allow ourselves to squander what was hard fought for and earned by our forefathers.     The censor often poses a few questions that do cause one to wonder '@CAPS9 it really better off this way?'. They point out that for every great work of intellegent art, other of a more deviant nature create some more innapropriate pieces of 'art'. Pornography @CAPS9 the most prevalent of their examples, pointing out that if they did not restrict it, then who would stop the hundreds of children that not only roam the libraries bookshelves but also the provided internet services. It @CAPS9 a reasonable question, once that should be take into consideration, but in answer to it I believe that it @CAPS9 and will always be the job of the parent or guardian that bring the child with them. It @CAPS9 simply not enough to drop a child off at the local library and hope they find something interesting. Helping that child find what they want @CAPS9 a journey that should be taken by both the parent and the child. And what about those who believe the censor isn't always right about what @CAPS9 and what @CAPS9 not acceptable for the general @ORGANIZATION1? As author Katherine Paterson once said 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'     Censorship has been around for a very long time, and will most likely never be fully cut out of any functioning @ORGANIZATION2. That @CAPS9 sadly an inevibility that cannot be avoided. But the amount that it occurs in your daily life will be directly affected by how much of your freedom you are willing to stand up for.",5,6
3614,"I believe that it is unfair to ban ony sort of materials from the library.  It simply isnt right to withold information from your children.  Any information that they might read or hear is something that they are going to find out sooner or later anyway.  Wouldn't you much rather your children find out from reading it in a book or magazine or hearing it in a movie or cd?  Then they can ask parents any questions that they @MONTH1 have about things they have read and heard instead of hearing it from a teenager in the hall or talking to a friend about it and being misguided and given the wrong information.     If your child is to read about sex or an affair in a magazine wouldnt you like to know?  Would you want them to ask you questions about it so that they understand the difference between right and wrong.  Wouldn't it be much easier to know that your child is educated on certian things so that they know when things are false and they're not confused or worried about something small?     Any of the things that they @MONTH1 read in a magazine or see in a movie are things that they could easily look up on the internet.  On the internet there are more graphic photos, and some websites give false information on subjects.  Your childs curiosity could take them to inappropriate websites.      When i was a child and I was curiouse my parents sheltered me from certian things. I found out what kinds of things they were trying to hide from me while I was only in @NUM1 grade when high schoolers on my bus told me all about sex, showed me pictures and told me things that I would have much rather heard about in class or read.  I felt like I couldnt talk to my parents about these things.  I mean what would you do if your second grader came home form school and started talking to you about the kinds of things that they had heard on the bus.  What if the high schoolers had been lieing to me, I would feel stupid for saying anything about it because my parents wouldn't have understood what I was talking about.      What I'm saying is that understand that there are some things that a child should never be allowed to read, see, or hear.  It isn't fair to them that they don't get the opportunity themselves to learn about it and ask questions. Besides isn't it your fault in all reality if they get they're hands on somthing innapropriate for their age becuase they aren't getting the proper supervision?  If you feel that they are reading, listening, or watching something that you feel is in appropriate, ask questions.  Explain things to them when they ask you a question.  Don't beat around the bush.  Make sure that they know the difference between good and bad, right and wrong. It truely is not fair to take these things away from them when they don't even know why they are not allowed to look at it",4,4
4747,"When you walk into the heavenly sanctuary that is our library, you have opened yourself up to a vast wealth of knowledge that is available to you at the click of a mouse, the push of a button, or the turn of a page. There are those of a select few, however, who are under the paradigm that not all of this information is for all eyes. They feel it should be locked away, as if it were some eyesore. Allow me to address this view with retaliation and distaste on a number of levels in the following document.     I am a musician. Music is my passion. My creative gears are forever turning. Often I look to other artists' works for inspiration, and the one place to get that music is, you guessed it, the library. How disappointed am I when I find that the music I want has been removed for being explicit. It was not the lyrics or foul message I sought, but the beautiful melodies and harmonies therein! It does not do well to isolate media without first seeing the good that lies in it and the strong feelings it has to convey.     We @MONTH1 discard the world's greatest novel because of racial discrepancies or wizardry. We @MONTH1 throw away a moving song because of its lyrics. We @MONTH1 trash a movie after only reading the title, never even giving it a chance. How fair is this? Even now there @MONTH1 be those who refuse to read your newspaper because of their disagreements with one, individual editor. That is no fair crop in my right mind.     I implore you, as a public, as people of sound mind and stout hearts to reconsider the censorship of those works which have a clear and true message and were forged for the benefit of our humankind. All things have a story to tell. A friend of mine once said to me, that there were three ways we could absorb things that we find undesirable. We can reject, we can ignore, or we can absorb and interpret. To reject leaves you no smarter. To ignore leaves you in fear. However, to absorb, you gain new knowledge, be it of a new culture or new person. Everything must be taken with a grain of salt. Let us watch something we find immoral and then take the time to understand why it is immoral, for it is these things that define us. If you do not see what is or is not right, who is to say what is truly ethical? We need material of substance in our libraries, for our exposure and for our fathoming of new knowledge in our modern world",5,6
3498,"In a library it's censorship should be conrtolled by the people that go to that library. If it is a public library then the visitors should have the right to choose what books go on the shelf. The libraries should not take books off the shelf due to the beliefs of one person, no the libraries should take all the books and give them a rateing once they have that only the reader should decide if the book, music, movies, magazines, etc, are offensive to them.     Of course there are some books that adults @MONTH1 not wish their child to read and then they should talk to the librarian and set a boundry of what rateing of book their child can check out. Organizing the books this way anbody can read anything they want to though there are the books they don't want to read or even see on the shelf, they need to stop a minute and realize that one of the books they like someone else might not want on the shelf.     In the end the books that are on the shelf are the choice of the library because they are the people that purchase the books. so to prevent a power struggle this way a comittee should be set up to decide what books to purchase. you will still have to deal with people not wanting a certain kind of book, but those people will just have to deal with it.     The books on the libraries banned book list should be in the libray also, the books are just books weather you read them or not is your choice. The one exception to this should be at school libraries because it is the schools money purchasing the books the administration or the school board should choose which books go in the library.     In short my veiw of book censorship is that, the library will choose the books that go into the library. To make things easier the books should have a rateing system that would be the national standard for all public libraries. Like I stated previously the books are just books its your choice to read them",4,4
4047,"As the Katherine Paterson's quote states everyone in fact has the right to take books, movies, magazines and other items off the shelves if deemed offensive or inappropriate. However this should be their decision and only their's; not other parents rallying together to get their desired results; the removal of certain books.      In todays times so much is viewed as offensive or inappropriate that wasn't when the previous generations read them. When parents read these things today they feel these items are inappropriate versus when they were teenagers they felt it was appropriate. Of course in todays technological age kids can lay their hands on just about anything if they know how to.      So, if parents begin censoring items there is one incentive or reason for them to read or listen to it; and disobey parents. They also get receive an unconventional or unintended education. So if parents censor the kids have been given a multitude of reasons to go against their parents wishes and read or listen to it anyway. So that is why parents shouldn't censor what their kids read, listen to, or see because eventually they will see it. Do you want that?",3,3
3141,"To @CAPS1 it @MONTH1 @CAPS2:     @CAPS3 I walk into a library, I want to be able to think I am in a peaceful place where I can find books that are helpful for what I need and are not harmful to anyone. Anywhere I go I want to feel like a free person and shouldn't have to worry about things that will hurt others or myself. People are people and everyone should be treated the same. It doesnt matter what color your skin is, the way you look, or how you talk. Everyone should be treated equaly. I believe if there is something offensive in a movie, magazine, books, or anything to any kind of people it should be removed for good. It doesnt matter what the past was like. The present is all that matters and in my opinion everyone deserves the same.      I beleive that no one in this world should feel ashamed of who they are. If someone is @CAPS4 @CAPS5 they should be proud of it and shouldn't be afraid of negative things that would hurt their feelings. I think most people would agree @CAPS3 I say everyone in this world should be treated the absolute same. Negative things in books or magazines or anywhere should be removed for good. We do not need things like that in our world. That is what causes people to become crazy and get into gangs or into drugs. Our world shouldn't concist of bad things that will hurt the lives of others. Anything that is negative to a person or group of people shouldn't be allowed and should be thrown away. Inacent people do not deserve what people received in the past. The past has nothing to do with what is going on in the present. Right now people should be proud to be who they are and not scared of things like that. I treat people the way I want to be treated and that should go for everyone. Harmful things need to be removed from everything. We do not need things like that in our world. People should be able to live free and feel proud of who they are.     In conclusion I beleive that certain materials should be removed if they are found offensive. Everyone is who they are and that shouldn't have an effect on others and the way they live. People should feel proud to be here and not scared of things that could impact their lives forever. Harmful things are not good in this world and shouldn't have an impact on others. Everyone deserves the best and should be treated with care, not hatred.",3,3
4602,"How many of you out there absolutely love to read? Well, im going to be the first to confess that I do not prefer reading. Meanwhile, whether or not I prefer or differ readings of all types, I despise of any negative books. Censoring books is very important in today's lifestyle. One can make an inference by looking at the cover of a book. The cover oftens creates a vivid image and will usually promote a general idea. Let's look at some reasons why I feel that graphic or offensive books should be removed from book shelves.          What about the younger children who like to read? Although kids have a wild imaginaion, authors should't fill their heads with too many crazy ideas. First of all, kids now days either grab a book from the shelf and show interest very quickly, or automatically assume it's not for them. Furthermore, when a kid comes across a very offensive book it could hurt there feelings. Books are supposed to provide eductional information or be entertaining. They should not be dirty, nor discouraging towards certain people.           More importantly, how many different races are there here in @LOCATION1, or even all around the world? Many different races take interest in new books to learn new ways. When they come across books that are not teaching for all races or are actknowledging bad examples on thier kind, they feel discouraged. Whether it's a movie, magazine, books, or even a song, never should it be offensive towards anyone. When authors, publishers, song writers, or movie producers release these items, they do not think of the surroundings. Thier main concept is to entertain, but sometimes entertainment can be quite bashful.           Most importantly, if it contains sexual gestures it should be removed without debate. It's offensive to parents with young children who visit libraries. A public library which is open to all, should have sections for books, movies, cd's or magazines that are too vivid. There's a wide range of books laying around and one @MONTH1 come across one that is strongly offensive. I believe they should have a word in whether or not the book belongs on the shelf or not. I've not experienced it yet, but believe me it could happen anytime in our world today. If i was a parent I wouldn't encourage sexual magazines or books being shown at a public library.      Finally, during this debate older or more dirty minded people will counterargue this topic. Who says children should be allowed in the adult sections? Why are the discouraged people reading books that are setting bad examples? Those are some of the questions you will here for those who counter what I've written today. Adults should be allowed there own personal section for adultlike books, movies, or magazines. Kids under age should stick to searching for books in areas or fields that will provide interest for them.      In conclusion, those who counterargue could be on the winning side, however I still believe offensive books should be removed from shelves. Book lovers all around the world want enteratinment, but in good ways. The younger children of our time right now need to be influenced the proper way. Furthermore, there is no better way to help improve society than by removing offensive and noninfluential books from libraries. Lets make an inference and say, if we work to remove these offensive books, younger children will become more educated.",4,4
4286,"I think that the books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelvs. If a book, magazine, movie, etc, is found offensive then you should just walk away and ignore it. Dont go back and keep looking at it because what you find offensive someone else might like.      The world won't change around you so you shoud do the smart thing and ignore it. If somthing is found offensive on censorship in libraries then mabey its not a good idea for you to be where you are in that library. And if somthing does offend you, you should still act appropreatley and deal with the situation the right way.     When i was younger i used to see book's with a cover titled @CAPS1, @CAPS2, @CAPS3, @CAPS4, etc., and would think it was funny, but the adults didnt think so. The books are put there for people to read not just to look at. The books, music, movies, magazines are not there to offend you in any type of way.  If you find somthing offensive then you should just move away from that area, so that you wont worry about having to be offended.      Diffrerent people like different things, so they will have many different verieties to choose from in a library. They might have some things that really offend you or they might have some things that you really like. You have to make a wise choice and know that if somthing is goin to offend you stay away from it.     Censorship in libraries have every right to put up any and every peice of book, music, movie, magazine, etc., because it in their phacility. They should'nt have to worry about people being offended by anything they put up. They should'nt have to worry about people being offended because @PERCENT1 of the time the things they put up are not bad at all, 'it @MONTH1 even be helpful,' but to one person it @MONTH1 be harmful or offend them.     In @CAPS5, censorship in libraries should be able to post or shelve anything they want. If your offended/not offended they have every right to shelve whatever it is. because in the real world you dont always get what you want, and you wont always like what you see",3,3
4511,"Should there be censorship in libraries? Some say there should be, some do not.  Cultural books and magazines could be offensive to some readers.  History in books can sometimes even be offensive depending on someones lifestyle or background.     Are you wrong if you say you want censorship in the library?  No, you are not wrong because there are many people who think that some books should be taken off of the shelves of there local libraries.  Some of there reasons are because parents could have  young children and they do not want to expose them to such things while they are young and vulnerable.  Others though say that censorship is unnecessary because people are going into the library and looking for a book at their own risk.  Meaning that if someone goes to the library looking for a certain book and they pick up one they find as offensive, it could be a good book for someone else.     Do all books that are considered 'offensive' have to be fiction?  No, not all books have to be fiction if they are offensive.  This does not mean that there aren't books out there like that.  Cultural books or magazines from other countries or of a certain topic can sometimes be very graphic and have language that is only appropriate for certain ages.  Everywhere in the @CAPS1 no matter where you are there are going to be things that could either interest you or be offensive to you. Everybody has there own opinion on the matter.  The cultural @CAPS3 in the library are just showing how the people of othere countries live and act.  It is not opinions or false claims in these @CAPS3, only fact.  So cultural @CAPS3 should not be censored, although it could have a section just for that type of material.     History books can be one of those @CAPS3 that really depends on your opinion or what you were raised in.  Religion is one thing that history books can really raise offense to people because it could have some of the facts wrong about that type of religion.  Some people would get very upset about how it was wrong because they are teaching the kids wrong about religion.  Race and origin are another problem with some people.  History books and elder's stories can always somehow be mixed and could cause trouble.  For example if a @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @NUM1 veteran told a story about what happened in a certain area; the history book could tell a completely different story.  History books should not be censored because it is facts and teaching kids on what has happened in the past and how people survived.     My views on the censorship of libraries is that there should not be any of it.  Maybe the library could make a section for what people might think is 'offensive.'  @CAPS3 or books should definately not be taken off of the shelves though, because one man's offense is another man's great read",5,4
3526,"Do you think that certain books, music, magazines are sometimes found very offensive? If I had kids I wouldnt want my kids to be around any of these bad things. I think that we should remove all of these bad things from the world to help the kids and childern become better people in the world.      There are a lot of bad people in the world but it is mostly because of all the things that people read and see. When people like great singers sing about drugs and other stuff kids think that it is cool to do drugs so they start to do them and then they cant stop! You want everyone to go to college and be doctors but they cant if they follow things that everyone else does. We need to encourage our children to be great people but we cant with drugs and volience that goes on around them, but we can try to banned the bad books, movies, and music. We need more good things to influence our children. We dont want our chilren to look at magazines and see women that are really tiny and they think that they have to look like that to be popular. If your children what to read and listen to these things then you cant let it influence them. I listen to rap music all the time but i never let it influence me because i want to be successful in my life.     These are all the reasons why be should banned these things from our children. If you want your children to be successful then you will keep your kids away from the volience and drugs. I know what kind of things happen when you dont keep them away. You dont want these things to happen to your kid so keep them away from it.",3,3

3919,"Libraries are a source of information. They provide us with valuable research, entertainment, and cold hard facts.

Everyday we have choices. We also have choices at a library. If we see a book with a title that sounds like @CAPS2 might be offensive, then we should just walk past @CAPS2. Most libraries are organized and the book sections are clearly stated. Common sense would tell us that this section might contain offensive material. We have the choice on whether or not we check out a book that might offend us or not. If @CAPS2 does offend us, then @CAPS2's our own fault.      The second reason libraries should not censor what books they provide goes right along with the choices we make in life. No one forces us to check out this book or that book. @CAPS2's a choice. No one puts a gun to our head and says, '@CAPS1 this book or you will die.' @CAPS2 just doesn't happen like that. No one forces us to @CAPS1 something we don't want to. @CAPS2's all up to you and how you feel about the book.      Different subjects offend different people. I'm not offended by a curse word here or there, however; I am offended by sex related instances that often occur in movies or books. I make my own choice to not watch or @CAPS1 those kinds of materials. Since everyone is different, the sex related instances might not offend another group of people and they might see @CAPS2 as perfectly fine to watch or @CAPS1. Different subjects offend different people and taking away a book or movie because @CAPS2 offends one person should not happen.      If libraries were to start censoring what materials they put on the shelf, I believe many people would be upset. Who would decide what is offensive and not offensive? @CAPS2 would upset too many customers and the use of libraries would probably dwindle. When you are in charge of censoring what goes on the shelf many problems come into play. Do you count different religions offensive because they blaspheme another religion's god? Do you count a certain work of fiction offensive because @CAPS2 contains one curse word in the whole book? There is no way to properly censor all your books without upsetting customers.     I'm not saying that libraries should be allowed to show every magazine known to man. Some are obviously worse than others; but, when @CAPS2 comes to books and movies, the people know what they are checking out and know what they will find offensive. There are too many people in this world to try and censor the materials libraries display. Libraries should not censor the materials they display",4,4
4754,"Do citizens have the right to remove books, magazines, and other materials from shelves because they personally do not agree with the content? Censorship in libraries is a subject with an unclear answer.  Some believe it is in their right to get rid of books, music, and movies with what they believe is 'offensive' material. Others think library censorship is wrong, that people should have access to whatever material they please. Censorship is simply a way of preventing knowledge from those who wish to learn more about worlds outside their own.     In @DATE1's society, there are no limits. The human imagination can create beautiful works of literary art and music, but it can also create material not suitable for every age group. Library censorship is a way to keep this 'unsuitable' material away from young and curious eyes. However, what @MONTH1 be unacceptable for children to view @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for a mature adult. Censorship is purely opinion. If a person is a strict believer that @CAPS1 created the world in seven days, they might find it offensive to see a book or a movie that supports the theory of evolution. If a parent does not want their child to watch @CAPS2, they would rather their children not see a @CAPS2 disk in the children's section for their child to see. If one person harbors a profound grudge against @CAPS4, it is unfair to others if all @CAPS5 content is removed from a library's shelves. If a person does not wish to have access to certain 'offensive' subjects, then they do not have to expose themselves to it. But it is not in their rights to remove it from the view of others who @MONTH1 wish to educate themselves on the said matters.     Writing is a form of self- expression, a method by which to convey feelings and thoughts and share them with others. It is also a way to teach and to inform others about the past. But if what is written is not shared, how can one form their own opinions and thoughts when they are not exposed to the opinions of those outside their community? It is unfair to prevent someone from learning about a certain subject simply because one or two other people oppose the content. If books and movies containing information unacceptable to one person were removed, then everyone else has the right to have material of their choice removed as well. Eventually, there would be nothing left because everyone is offended by one thing or another. That is one of the beauties of being an @CAPS6 citizen: freedom of speech. By living in @LOCATION1, one has the right to read or learn about whatever they please. Censorship prevents learning from those who want it.     Parents are possibly some of the biggest advocates of library censorship. Not wanting their children to be exposed to explicit or graphic material is understandable. But just because they do not want their child to see a movie about devil worship or the @CAPS7 era does not mean the parent has the right to prevent all others from seeing it. Children need to be exposed to these kinds of things at some point to encourage open- mindedness and acceptance of others. Libraries provide a source by which young people can educate themselves on the religions, beliefs, and customs of the outside world. It should not be up to the parents to decide what is put on the library shelves; if they do not want their children to have access to certain subjects, do not allow them to go to the library.      In conclusion, one can say library censorship is a matter of opinion. Citizens have a right to read, listen to, or watch whatever material they please. Granted, it is acceptable for parents to shield their children from certain subjects, but it is unaccepable for those same parents to prevent others in the community from learning. Freedom to express one's opinions in the form of literature means nothing if that literature cannot be shared with others. As Katherine Paterson once said, '... And then we have no bookes left of the shelf for any of us.",5,5
4630,"Have you ever walked into a library and saw a book that you wouldn't what your child or any young one to pick up and read? There is several book in the library that young children should read. I don't believe that you a certian book should be removed from the library because it is offensive to some or not suitable for children, but there is a few things that can be done to keep those books away from your kids or any child. The possable things that could be done is; move those book to a higher shelf, designate a certian area for those books, or put an age limit on those books.     The first way that you could keep an offensive book out of your childs, or any other childs hands is to move those book to a higher shelf. Doing this will keep those books out of your childs sight and reach. That will keep them out of childens hand, and prevent them from reading them.     The next possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any childs hand is to, designate a certain area for those books in the library. Doing this will provied a 'barrior', so that you could tell your child to stay out of that area, and keep a watch on them to make sure they don't go in that area. You would also know where those books are so the you could make sure they don't go to that area.     The final possability to keep offensive books out of your childs or any other childs hands is to put an age limit on those book to keep the children from being able to check-out those books, to read them. This would make the childen have be a certain age before the can check them out, preventing them from reading them.      These are a few possabilities that could be used to keep offisive books out of childrens hands, and preventing them from reading those offensive books that you wouldn't want them getting a hold of and reading",3,3
4575,"Censorship is a two sided question. There are people who believe that everything should be left the way that it is written. While other people believe that subjects that are offinisve should be removed. Is a subject too graphic for students? People have the freedom of speech. Knowledge is power. These are some reasons that can be thought about be for deciding if censoship is right or not.     What is too offinsive for a student to read? In history many things are considered offensive. If all the books that talk about history are gone then how will students be able to learn about the past. If students can't learn about the past than the past is bound it repeat itself. Other books like horror books are for entertainment purposes, so what is wrong with someone reading a book on a murder if its just for entertainment? There are books that must be kept so that students can learn to their full abilities.     If books are censored than that takes away a persons right to freedom of speech. That restricts somes creativity and since of wonder. If certain books are taken off the shelves of a library than books that are famous now @MONTH1 have never have been read. Books even if they are offensive can show someones thoughts and ideas that could have changed the world.     People everywhere learn from books. Books about the past help people understand what to do different for the future. Many things are learned from books everyday and if certain books are taken down there will be things that will never be learned, bacuse someone thought that the book was not appropriate for a student to read. Students read books about the past so that they learn. The past is the best teacher and when the past is gone there is no way for those students to learn about the past. Having books that are said to be offinsive can help in @MONTH1 ways.     All books should remain on the shelves. No matter what the book talks about a student can learn from that book. If the book is something that a student doesn't want to learn about than they don't  have to read the book. A lot can be learned from books and without books there can not and will not be knowledge that is spread for future generations to come.",4,4
4381,"Books,music,movies, and magazines that are in libraries should be approprete material. But in some cases it's fine to have some offensive litature because people can learn from it. But there needs to be an age limit to checking out these itims out. So I do beleave we should keep offensive litature on the shelve. There needs to be a certian exstent to what we leave on the shelves.     Books,books, and more books, there are so many books and many other kinds of litature in libraries today. Libraries are a place of silance, and to some people thats boreing. So like me when I go into a librarie I go to the books, or maginzes that seem very intresting to me. Altho they @MONTH1 seem intreseting to me, others @MONTH1 find them offensive. Like it might be a comic book that my say something that someone my take offense to.      Libraries can't please everyone that walks throught the doors. Just because someone dose not like the offensive stuff thats in there dosen't mean they have to take it out. Because there might be someone like me that likes thoes kind of books, or magazines. There are offensive stuff all over the world so you can't avoid it every where you go. I beleave there is a good out come for keeping offensive litature material on the shelves.      I think that keeping offensive material in libraries @MONTH1 have a good cause to it for one very good reason, learning. Like I said before it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people but to some it's not. So some people might like to learn about offensive things. @MONTH1 be they never knew thoes things that are in thoes books. They @MONTH1 also never know whats in thoes books unless they keep them on the shelves. They need to have a section where offensive books,magazines,music and movies go. If some things it's offensive put it on the shelve, and they must be @NUM1 years old to check it out if it's on that shelve.       Yeah there @MONTH1 be a down fall to keeping offensive things in libraries. But you can't hide from it all your life .So insted of going out into the world and learning about it the hard way go to the librarie. You could pick a book up learn about it and how to deal with it. It's just part of live there is offensive material every where. You can't be shelterd your whole live.       So in my greatest opinon I do beleave that we should keep these offensive material in libraries, it could be a learing exsperiance",3,3
4606,"I believe that some materials we have in our shelf belongs to basically anybody in the world.  I also think that the materials on that shelf is allowed to be removed as long as those materials get put back in that spot no matter what.     My experiance with books are not really that great but i do like to read at times when i have the spare time to read. When i get a book i look at the book and i observe it so that way when i take it out of the library i know i wanted to read that book and observe the great thing about the book.when i read the book im not a very fast reader but when im reading i like to know how this book is gunna end and how it begans. If i was to pick a magazine from the library i wouldn't take it out of the library cause magazines are expensive to get at times and also hard to replace if it was ever needed to be replaced. But if i was to get one i would look at the important stuff on what it is and how to get it and all that kind of stuff. their are times when i think movies shouldn't able the library cause people could take ideas off of movies and/or steal them. movies in libraries would be expensive to pay if it was tooken from the library. if i was to watch a movie i would enjoy it as much as possible cause once that day comes to turn it in their is no chance of watching it after i turn it in. Music is passion to most people. most people would just go out and buy some cd's or something to listen to and their are music i would listen to so that i get an idea on what to play if i ever wanted to become an musician or something like that. their are times when i would write down the lyrics to a song so that way i can understand what the singer is singing about, either that or listen to the song over and over again.     My point is if something comes off the shelf is should return to its rightful spot or otherwise their will be consequences and people will not be trusted much longer",3,3
4473,"Removing books off of shelves in our public library? To me, that sounds crazy. I can see how some people might be offended by some books, music, movies, magazines, etc., but some people appreciate it. It's diversity, some people love the down-to-earth literature, but some people can't handle it. Why take away something that only a few people disagree with?        I believe some of the best entertainment in libraries are the most offensive, but it is all fact. I mean, if this is such a problem there should be a certain section to find those things in. If people want to complain then they can get out of that section, because people like me will be in that section ready to learn about all these different varieties of entertainment. Whether if it's offensive or not.People @MONTH1 find some of it offensive, but I believe it makes that person stronger. It helps them realize how lucky they are that they're not being treated a certain way in the offensive book they're reading. It's just a piece of entertainment! If it offends you and you're not entertained, go find something that does!           Even though I hear of people reading offensive books I've never really seen one myself. I think some people just get offended too easily. That's where we should reason with them instead of giving into their demands. So what if they aren't taken off the shelves? Like I said, we can make a certain section for them type of things. If they aren't happy with the outcome, they will get over it.           Now that you read what  I had to say, what do yu think? Do you think we should remove certain entertainment off of library book shelves? Or should we just reason with the people who are offended? I hope what you read today helps keep books on the shelves and readers happy!",4,4
4532,"There are books up and down the shelves in the library that @MONTH1 make people wonder @CAPS1 they are up there.  People @MONTH1 stand there and stare at a book and ask themselves, '@CAPS1 in the world is this book here?'  @CAPS2 many people @MONTH1 not know is that every book is in the world for a reason.  Books published are in the world to teach about history, manners, literature, or they could be made to take you on an advantage.  Of course you @MONTH1 come across a book that @MONTH1 be offensive to someone, maybe even yourself, but it is there for a reason.     I once read a book that I found in our school library that was about slavery.  It was a first person novel about a boy who was taken away from his family after being sold to a different plantation owner.  Now some people would have been very offended by this book, because the @CAPS3 were calling the @CAPS4 all those names that the @CAPS4 do not like to be called.  But that book helps people realize how much pain that slavery put on people.     People can go to any library, from one in an elementary school to a public library, and you will always find at least one book about the @CAPS6.  Just about everyone would get offended by one of these books, because nobody liked or does like @CAPS7, but they have to be there because of history.  People can not just take the books out because it offends so many people.  That would be like taking the @CAPS6 out of history, and that just can not happen.  If it happened, it happened, and people have to know.     Whether people admit it or not, they have ran into at least one book that has offended them.  That will happen, it is almost natural for it to happen.  But it would also offend people if you took books off the shelf.  Those people know that books teach us, and we need books to know @CAPS2 is possible, @CAPS2 happened, and @CAPS2 might happen.  Books are here for a reason, and they need to stay",4,4
3053,"Have you ever noticed how much bad materials are out there for childeren to get ahold of?  A movie, book, magazine, music, or even something on @CAPS1?  It would be nice to get rid of all that bad material, but what if someone else doesn't feel the same way about that song, movie, or @CAPS1 show?  I think it would be horrible if we took away all the bad materials because it might bring violence between some people who disagree on it, and it goes against one of our rights, freedom of speech.     In the world we live in today, if you take something away from someone like their favorite book, its going to bring out some violence between some people.  Look back into our history, we are a country full of rebels.  That is how @CAPS3 even came to be.  So take away something from people they are going to stand up and fight for it.  There will always be people trying to smuggle and hide some things, so we will never be able to get rid of it completly.       If you take away all the bad materials it would be taking away one of our rights, freedom of speech.  Some materials out there @MONTH1 be offensive to others, but it's not like we have a right to get rid it.  It's not like there is any book, magazine, or even a song out there that someone doesn't get offended by.  If we do take away all the offensive materials we should take away everything. So what is the point we all will never all agree on something, we can't please everyone.  In taking away all the offensive materials you are taking away people's right to freedom of speech.     Don't try to take away all the offensive materials, it will just bring violence and make it all much worse than it was.  If you're a parent it's not like you can shield your children from everything because eventually they will learn what it all is.  So it won't do any good to try to get rid of it.  It will still be around.  It is just something in our world that we have to live with",3,3
3081,"What do you want your child being exposed to?    In my own opinion I believe that @CAPS1 shouldn't be taken off the shelfs, because kids know what books are appropriate and innappropriate for them. This @CAPS2 why the library has @CAPS3 'kids' selction away from the 'adult' selction. They know their boundaries, and I don't think a librarian would let a child check out anything innappropriate. The library @CAPS2 a place for all sorts of books for anybody to come and have the right to check them out.   Also, @CAPS3 not just librarys', @CAPS1 can be seen or heard from schools, on the radio, t.v. and video games. Any where you go they're more likely going to see innapropriate actions that take place. So as a parent @CAPS3 your job to keep your child away from the things you don't want them to see or hear as much as possible.       The only way a child can be exposed to this @CAPS2 if their parents are unattended and irresponsible. Someday your kids will ask questions about that that kind of stuff they hear or see at school from other students. Just be open and honest at the right time but in a mature clean matter.      I know alot of young children these days who are being exposed a lot from violent video games, music about drugs, alchol, and sex. @CAPS1 really bothers me, because when I was their age I had no idea what @CAPS1 even was or meant. @CAPS1's wrong for the parents to let them be around that when they know @CAPS1 has a label on @CAPS1 saying '@CAPS10 @CAPS11', '@CAPS12'  or '@NUM1'.      Every time I hear a child say something about this aweseome video game or cool new song they heard on the radio about drugs, violence and etc, the children tend to get younger and younger every time. I don't understand why parents let them be exposed to that unecessary stuff",4,4

Even though  you know its not there, but you just looking and you end up finding whatever it is you where looking for.             And what if you wanted to look for a myster book and only the library had that book you where looking for. I can think of alot of reasons why we need certain materials. well i guess that about sums that up for me.                 And in concultion put yourself in the same shoes or even my shoes. What would you do? would you let them remove those materials or would you fight for them to stay.",1,2
3889,"Imagine @CAPS1, you are in the library looking for a book to read, to when your son or daughter runs up to you holding a magazine of questionable nature. What do you do? A library should not have inapporiate items on the shelves. Censoring libraries is something to protect you and your family. Libraries should be censored so that way everyone can enjoy themselves.     The first reason I thing that libraries should be censored is because of the children that go there. Children are curious and they are always attracted to things that are colorful and different. An example I have of @CAPS1 is my baby sister. She wanted to go to the zoo instead of the museum because as she said 'I want to see the animals, not a boring statue. I can see those anytime around town.' @CAPS1 is showing that children want to see different things and if they were to go to the library and see the same items then there is not anything to worry about. The first time they see something of questionable nature they would want it because it is new.     The second reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes not all of the items in the library are put in the right place. Say that you wanted to watch a movie that sounded really good and you checked it out at the library, went home, put it in, and find out it is not the movie you thought it was. What if you rented that movie for a party and had guests over? Would that not embarrass you? Well something like that happened to my cousin but she got a @LOCATION1. She was embarrassed for weeks after it happened. All of that embarrassment could have been prevented if the libraries had to be censored.      The third reason that libraries should be censored is that sometimes seeing certain material in a library can be rather offensive. Would you be offended by seeing something like that? I know that I would. I would not want anyone to be offended like that. When I was little I went to the mall with my grandmother. We were trying to buy a new pair of jeans for me. I got offended when the salesperson said that I 'looked fat' in the jeans I had picked. I know what it is like to be offended and people should take other peoples' feeling into account before they offend.     While some people thing that inapporite material is fine to have in a library I believe that they should find other places for it. Think of your family and how much you love them. Think of what not having  a censor on the libraries can cause. Do you want to be responsible for not doing anything to help?  Try to find ways to get stricter laws on censoring libraries",4,4
4136,"It really don't matter to me because I only go to the library to get a book when my teacher at school makes me. But a  library should be able to put whatever they want out on a shelf because the library is devided up in sections for kids, young adults, and adults. If a person don't like what he or she sees on a shelf at a library then they don't have to look at it, or check it out. Just because one person don't like it dont mean someone else dosn't.      Librarys don't make people look at or check out something they don't like. so why are people complaining about it. They are getting to checkout books, movies, and music for free unless it becomes over due. So people stop complainging about what the library has on there shelves.",2,2
3330,"Eventually, everyone sees or hears offensive things. However, the government has taken it upon themselves to try and keep youth from seeing it. They believe the parents should tell their children about everything while they try to make it one big secret for kids. But, if kids are introduced early, we would not have to keep it a secret anymore. Libraries and all types of media should not be censored.      Kids always ask questions like 'where do babies come from?' and adults, wanting to avoid an awkward conversation, make up stories or do not tell them the whole truth. Imagine a world where the government let the media say whatever they want. Yes, at first it would be vulgar but the government would then have the right to teach about sex and drugs in school. More kids would be educated, so less of them would be curious enough to do any of that stuff.     That is not to say that newscasters should curse everytime they are on television. It is merely suggesting that instead of having a metaphorical black curtain over half the news, they report the whole truth. They have freedom of speech, and we have a right to know.     At first, people would think it was a terrible world. But, eventually, with right leadership, it would help make a more truthful environment. Kids would learn about sex and drugs in school, and have a safe environment to answer their questions if they have any. Drug use and rape would go down. Then, talking about 'offensive' topics would be non-existent so kids would not be embarassed if they had questions. This would change the world for the better.",3,3
3932,"Censorship in libraries is almost a primitve if not childish way to exclude what one might think to be offensive from everyone else, is it not? Think about it. A kid who doesn't let another kid play with him at recess today, only because he stuck his tongue out at him during math the previous day, seems pretty childish, and several much more reasonable solutions come to mind to anyone who sits and thinks about the situation for more than a second. This scenario runs paralell with censorship in libraries.     A book is a book to be read. That is, of course, an obvious statement. But why read a book? To get information. To learn something that you did not know, or to build on knowledge that you already had. How do you cook an exquisite meal? Go read a book to find out. How do you graph linear equations? There are books that will explain it for you. Is it fair for an avid astronomer, fealing no need to know how long a turkey needs to stay in an oven, to remove a book that teaches that very thing? Now, of course cooking a turkey will most likely not come across as offensive to someone perusing through their local library, however, think about this. The book has been written, so is that not a sure sign it is not offensive to at least one person, that being the author?     There are things people will not agree with. And just when you think you find something everyone likes, someone will come along and disturb the peace. Not everyone likes rap music, but it is still playing on the radio. It is free choice to listen to it. It is a free choice to read a book, regardless of what it says. Just because people have the misfortune to be subjected to material they find offensive, by accident or otherwise, and then project their disdainful comments toward someone in charge, does not mean that the offensive material should be thrown out.      Perhaps, radios and libraries can be even further examined. Radios have specific channels, playing specific music. There is a country music channel for those who want to listen to country music. As for libraries, there is of course the @ORGANIZATION1, but that is about as far as categoriazation goes. Suppose books be even further distinguished by the location within a library. A certain area designated for certain genres. That way, if you happen to find books about @CAPS1 concentration camps distasteful, then you can avoid the @CAPS2 and @CAPS1 ailse of the @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 section in your library. Problem @CAPS8. I find it hard to see something as offensive if I can't even literally see it.     You see, outright removal isn't really the best option for pleasing dissatisfied people. Compromise is. Now, after having thought about this situation for more than a second, I'm sure you have thought of much more reasonable solutions than something so ludicrous as censorship. Now the best part is seeing people enjoy books, and not being offended by the ones they don't like anymore",4,4
3937,"Picture for yourself you, as a @NUM1 year old child sitting in front of one of the greatest philosophers of history, @LOCATION1. Days later, you come to find out that he has been killed for 'corrupting the minds of the children.' @CAPS1 what? One of the greatest minds in human history has been censored because they didn't like his ideas. This is censorship at a basic level, and it happens to millions of books, movies, and songs every day. Censorship is not only wrong, its unnecessary. Here's why.     @CAPS1, when it comes down to it, most books, movies, and songs are meant to be interpreted in many different ways. For example, some poems are written with a vague tone so that they can be interpreted in different ways based upon the person. Besides, most music and books are meant to entertain, not offend. Granted, some books are meant to be interpreted in a certain way, but that still doesn't mean that they were meant to offend. Think about it next to you look at a copy of '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1; is it really that offensive to you?     When you are given a book in school for a class assignment, they usually expect you to read it because its of some educational value to you. Books like 'To @CAPS4 a @CAPS5' provide a huge educational value because they show what @CAPS6 culture was like, but everyday, someone new is trying to get it off the shelves of every school library in @LOCATION2 because they find it offensive. Ask yourself, is it right? The answer for me is no, since books like that hold an educational value that outweighs their offensiveness.     There's one last thing you must understand, and that is the fact that no matter how many books you take off the shelves, and no matter how many movies you ban, or how many songs you take away from us, the problem still isn't solved, its just been suppressed enough for different problems to arise, and those problem are that there are people who wanted to read this book @CAPS1 can't because you thought it was offensive. @CAPS1 this person complains to whomever banned this form of literature, and the book or other form of literature is put back on the shelves. @CAPS1 you feel it right to try and ban it again, but what does that solve? Nothing. Even if someone doesn't unban it, people can still teach and tell of what its about, making the ban worthless.     I hope that before you think about complaining about some book you found offensive, you think about this. Your complaint that causes the banning affects everyone. It affects a teacher's ability to teach, and a student's ability to learn. Is it really right of you to take away a good teaching material? Or you could ask yourself, what does it really solve? Either way, you still must know that bannig these things in wrong.",5,4
4537,"Everybody had their favorite movie, song, or book when they were younger. Sometimes these types of media aren't exactly child friendly. Songs today hint at sexual activities. Books about scary vampires and werewolves are being published. There are even movies that depict violent and inappropriate behaviors in which children should not witness. Does that mean they should be limited by a public place, such as a library?  Several people would agree, but I disagree.          Growing up, @PERSON1 was the wonder of my world. Her music was fun and unbeat, making a sunny day even more enjoyable. Her lyrics seemed like they meant nothing, until you thought about it a little more deeply. Even looking at the music videos, they show actions and images little children shouldn't be copying. Some @MONTH1 restrict their child from such material, but I would call that depriving a child of there freedom.           You can go to any public library and look through numerous selections of books, dvd's, cd's, and even magazines. Some library's even have computers available to the public. Not all places will carry your favorite aritist, movies, or reading material tho because they believe it isn't something little children should be indulging in. Who is to say a little kid can't enjoy the material that they'd like? That's like taking away part of a person's originality. A child would not have the opportunity to become an individual with their own opinions and feelings if they were restricted to a one mind track.          Limiting a child's media could benefit them in some way. Restricting time on computers, limiting the amount of hours playing video games or watching television could help teach a child time managment skills. Most children will see something interesting and repeat what they learned or share it with an adult and it could get them into trouble. Library's shouldn't have to take the offensive media off the shelves though. Age restrictions on renting those offensive types of materials should be set.           Just because a book or movie has language and images that shouldn't be seen by children is made, does not mean a library should limit that access to the public. Restrictions on renting that material could be set. It would solve all issues, in my opinion. In conclusion, censorship in public library's could be beneficial, but they should just set an age renting limit instead of removing all material alltogether. Therefore, making parent's happier and not restricting a person's freedom to develop there own opinion's and liking's of the different types of media",4,4
3911,"I think that none of the books should be removed from the shelves of a libraries.  I think that everyone should have a change of reading any book they want to. Just because a person or few people don't like it dosen't mean remove it.  They don't have to read that book.  If I did like a book i just don't like it.       everyone has their own choice of what kind of stories they are into.  Like im in to freaky novels.  Everyone I hangout with is not in to freaky novels.  In I mite not be into what they are into.  Like I dislike a lot of love stories not them all just a few of them I don't like.  I can say I am in to abnormal stories.  I like fiction stories then nonfiction.       My most favorite novels is 'The @CAPS1 @CAPS2'.  Most people would want to remove the stories with bad lauguage or vocabulary off the shelevs.  I know a lot of poeple that are into those kind of stories.  I think that would be unfair to do that.  Why take away what they like in not what you like.  Like I am into all kind of sex books.  Some poeple wouldn't want those books on the shelves either.         Just by removing someones type of book could make people don't want to read anymore.  I know it would make me stop reading if I can't read what I want to read.  Now think to yourself would you risk taking away someones favorite book. In the results of them not reading anymore. If you do theirs something wrong with you.  How would you feel if that was to happen to you.  So you all way pose to look at it in anothers persons point of veiw.         You should look at all the possitive way first.  Like how happy dose that makes that person that reads the books.  Not olny would it effect the read but the person who wrote the book.  You will be doing a lot of damage to a lot of people.  You would be putting someone out their job.  You could mess up someones family of living.  You could take away somones belifes.          You can make what they thought was a good thing into something bad.  You can drive a person crazy.  You can make what that person stand for meaning nothing at all.  Books could be a way people escape the real world.  Reading books could give people more things to talk about. Books can be a way of learning how to deal with thing in a better way.         I suggest that people should just leave the books wear they are at.  Books are way people express how they feel, they life style, and what they been threw etc.......  Life is hard in books makes it eaiser for some people",3,3
3174,"I do believe that some places have magizines, books, movies, and music that need to be removed from all shelfs. Just think, if you had childern would you want them getting ahold of a magizine with nude men or women in it. Yes people tell you they have control of there kids in stores, but i know you see kids all the time walking away or roming off to try to do what they want, and go to places they shouldnt be like magizines for instence. Would you want to find your little one looking at a magizine with nude wemon in it? Thats not the things kids should be finding in stores, its not nessacary.     Same deal goes with movies, say you rent a movie from one of your many movie places and it has nudity or cursing in it, do want that around your kids? i know i wouldnt, cause kids are like monkeys, monkey see monkey do, and you dont want your little one walking aroud cussing at you. I have little cousins and ive seen it happen many times where they cuss back at there parents, and when the parents ask them where they heard that its usually the same answer, tv or movies.      So do you really think it's nessacary to have all that bad stuff around for anyone, of many ages to see? It's not. Everything like that just needs to be taken off all shelf and destoryed, cause I shouldnt have to see it and niether should anyone else, its gross, nasty, and inrepropriet to childern. I say get read of it all and do everyone a favor",3,3
3235,"Why Censorship @CAPS1 @CAPS2?     In our everyday lives, we come across many things that can be taken to offense.  Some of these things we might not even realize, but they're out there.  Everybody doesn't want there children getting into the wrong things early on, but we know it will eventually happen.  We just have to teach our kids what @CAPS1 good and what @CAPS1 @CAPS2.  This goes for literary items too.  We need to have faith in our kids that they will do what @CAPS1 right.  I think that when old enough, they should be able to read books and listen to music that might be offensive.  I think we shouldn't get rid of all the offensive material at the libraries.     Now days, there @CAPS1 a lot of hard work that goes into music, movies, and books.  If we start getting rid of all the offensive material, many people will be offended that in itself.  The people that worked on the movie or wrote that book put a lot of time and effort into the piece.  They spent countless of hours working with others just to get the piece into publication, or trying to get somone to film their movie idea.  I think that it would be wrong to outrule peices of great literature because behind every one of them, there @CAPS1 a person that put a lot of effort into that material.     In every book you pick up today, you could look through it and find a offensive language or offensive gestures in it.  The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS1 a very detailed book and has many great facts in it, but many people find it offensive because it says @PERSON2 had a wife and had children.  This book isn't telling you what to believe or what actually happened, it @CAPS1 just a story full of conspiracy theories.  You can still believe what you want and read this book.  A movie that could be considered offensive just by the title @CAPS1 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 Can't @CAPS8.  Many people hear this title and @MONTH1 not want to watch it, thinking that it will discriminant against @CAPS6 people, but instead it @CAPS1 a very good movie about a group of people that play basketball.  Many things have offensive language but that doesn't mean we can't act like adults, read these books, and realize that they are just stories.  They are not telling you what to believe and what not to believe.     In our country today, we have many different ethnic groups, and many people think differently about things.  In our society we are given the right to have our own opinion about things, and we are able to like what ever we want.  Even though literary might be offensive, some people like reading books like this.  If I look in the library, I could find a book with offensive material, but the book could still be a very good book.  Even though it @CAPS1 disrcimanting against me, I could still love the book.  There @CAPS1 always controversy in our society, and almost everyone loves it.  Why get rid of these books when people are still enjoying them everyday.     Like Katherine Paterson said, if she has the right to take a book off of the shelf, then so does everyone else.  If we let everybody take books off the shelves, then there will be none left.  We cannot control everything that people do.  Taking offensive books out of the library will not stop people from reading them, but this will decline the library usage, and people will slowly stop reading.  If they don't like the books at the library, then they won't have problem with not reading at all.  I think that censorship in our libraries would be a @CAPS2 idea, and I think we should definitely not take out all the offensive material in the libraries",4,4
3468,"If someone is looking for an offensive book, they are going to find it, whether it's collecting dust on a library shelf or is brand new in a book store. The same goes for an offensive @CAPS1, magazine, or movie. Removing the offensive items from library shelves will only cause the people searching for these items to look elsewhere.      Different people have different opinions on what is offensive and what is not offensive. The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 is an example of a controversial book that many people believed to be offensive to their religious beliefs. While many people found The @CAPS2 @CAPS3 offensive, others enjoyed the story. If the book had been removed from libraries because some people found it offensive, then others who really enjoyed the book would not have been able to read it.     Another reason libraries should not remove offensive items from their shelves is that, most likely, the entire book, magazine, movie, etc. is not offensive the whole way through. Even if a movie has one offensive scene in it, the rest of the movie could be a great story that many people would benefit from seeing. It is the same idea with a book or magazine. There @MONTH1 be a few offensive chapters or one or two offensive articles, but very rarely will you find a book, movie, or magazine that is offensive the whole way through.      Of course, there are still offensive items that would be bad for younger kids to see even with the one or two offensive scenes, chapters, or article. There are easier solutions to this problem than having to remove the items from the shelves completely. One solution to this problem could be for libraries to put age limits on certain items, so that younger kids can't check out materials that are too innapropriate. But more importantly, this would be the job of the parents to monitor what their kids are reading, watching, or listening to.      Removing offensive books, magazines, music, and movies from the shelves of libraries would just cause more problems and complaints. I think it is a good idea to leave the material on the library shelves and caution library users to 'read at their own risk.'",4,4
3963,"Many Libraries today have limits on what they can put on their shelves.  Yes, their is offensive material out there in the world but, its just artists triing to make a name for themselves.  If we start controlling each others thoughts, feelings, and artist ability where will that get our culture that is rapidly expanding?  Libraries should not have the right to censor material.      One way to appeal to everyones demands would be to divide the library into two major sections childrens and adults and then you could contiue dividing sections.  Doing this would be cost-effective and adding a   age limit in the adult section so no noisy children could get into there would be nice.  It would help making finding a book easier for finding that right book.     Censorship is defined as taking out a paticular item, thats either offensive to a certain group or is banned.  If someone took out @PERSON2's @PERSON3 statue and other peices of work, we wouldnt get where we would be today.  If you take out material you never know where it could go or lead someone.  Censorship holds back many artists true potential.  Limiting someones knowledge could hurt that persons chance at becoming something in this world.     I have read many books that are both offensive in ways and other books about knowledge and intelligence and their is no difference. Many things interest different people. The author Katherine Paterson's quote explains this all to well if someone has a right to remove a book from the shelf than everyone has a right to remove a material off a shelve and so there would be no books left.  Censoring something not only hurts the person who created it but hurts everyone else.     Libraries should not censorship any material. Censoring material hurts everyones yearn for a open mind or a better understanding of something.  As Katherine Paterson's quote goes 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.  But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf---that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  @CAPS1 explains that if one person has a right to take a material off a shelf than everyone else has that right.   Censorship shouldnt be in libraries.",4,3
4015,"Books on shelfs are there for a reason    'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson wrote. The quote in short words for me means what should and should not be allowed for children and what they should learn as children. Libraries have non- fiction and fiction books as well as magazines, music and movies. I myself like to learn a little bit of everything but of course there is things that I dont like learning when I am too young. I like discovering things on my own. There is times where I do like discovering new things because I dont know when life ends. In other words I'm surrounded by reality and have to come out of the fantasy world. Magazines also just have a lot of trouble and sometimes, yes it's life but also its just dramatic things about people     A library is a good place to learn lots of things. You can learn about the history of presidents, countries, important people music,etc. Honestly, the only thing I go there for, is to read and to check out books, but from books I have learned a lot. There is some material that shouldnt be read and discovered when your too young.      Theres material that is too strong for some children and they should learn it as they grown not in a bunch. Libraries should have different stickers or labels on books for children and have a warning signs for their age. There is times where it is good to learn about life but you have to becareful because it @MONTH1 be to strong. There is books that teach you a lot. I have learned a lot from old books to new books. I don't think that the books should be removed, yes they @MONTH1 be strong, but is our owns choice to read it or not. There can be racist books, but they are there for a reason and it's not to make fun of people.     Magazines also are sometimes good because they teach good things and keep you updated about whats going on around the world. There is also some magazines that just talk drama and criticize famous people. I dont think its important and to be showing other people's personal lives or criticizing it. That is deffinetly not good for children to learn at that age. Magazines shouldn't be removed because everyone else has a decision at what to read and what to look at.      Music, at the library there is mostly music from like a centuries ago, but they were also great composers. No the music shouldn't be removed because everyone has a different taste in music. There's also new music, everyone has different taste and should choose what they want to listen to or who to listen to.      Movies, are a big part of life, so I think. Theres a lot from them that I learn from. From slavery to the future, there are movies where I have learned a lot. There is also some videos that are rated @CAPS1, @NUM1, @CAPS2, etc. It is our choice to watch the movie without no one telling us if we should or not.      There is different reasons why there are certain books, music, magazines, movies that offend people, but it also has a significance. Books are not racist so other people can be made fun of but to learn what they went through. I'm glad that I as I grow I know what to learn and when I'm to young to read something. I think it should be allowed because it's for everyone. I dont think nothing should be removed from shelves even if the material is offensive",4,4
4611,"What if one day you took a trip to the library, and you came across a book that was offensive? Would you ask for it to be taken off the shelf or just ignore it? Every year tons of @CAPS1 visit libraries in search of a good book, threw act of observations and personal appeal. Everyone has a different choose in the types of books they'd like to read, with that comes offensive and non-offensive material.     Being a teen i've had some experience visiting the library where things come across as offensive to me more easily than others but like many i choose to ignore it. Reasons for ignoring it are rather simple, everyone has different takes on things in which they've gathered since birth as we'll as personal life experiences. Because, everyone has different life experiences comes different views on what offends them or not. Personal experiences i've had in the library are from race seeing books that relate to the days of slavery @MONTH1 be offensive to me. But, a book on the black panther organization maybe offensive to someone else. So, does that mean it should be taken down off the shelf because it is offensive to both people?     Books have diffent tones weither its on life, politics, or worldly issues that make different people feel different ways. I've observed plenty of times where someone feels uplifted from reading a book. Where someone else reads the same thing and feels terrible. Take a magazine for instance, one reader could look like that beautiful women in that magazine and feel great about themselves. While maybe an overweight reader could read the same magazine and feel like there not beautiful or self worthy as the women in the magazine. That overweight women could feel offended, while the other women feels amazing, because of that simple reason it shouldn't be taken off the shelves due to different views of what offends them and what doesn't.     Everyone reads books due to there liking and what relates to them. If a book, magazine, or movie comes across as offensive then that reader probably won't pick it up to find out more about it. When i come across material in a library that is offensive to me i won't read it. Although i have picked up books that didn't come across as offensive, but after reading the material come to find out it was offensive. In response i simply returned the book and chose another one.     If i walked into a library and saw a book that was offensive to me i wouldn't ask for it to be taken off the shelf i would simply ignore it. Everyone has different views on what offense them so there's not much you can do except just ignore it. If the case was that if a book were to offend someone and it was taken out of a library due to just that there would be no real need for a library",3,4
3623,"I don't think that anything that gets checked out from the library should be censored. Some of the people that go to the library aren't looking for material with offensive language and/or themes. On the other hand, there are some people who go to the library who find that having offensive language spoken when it was meant to be is better than censoring it.     Take for example a book about @PERSON1. It could have some things in it that people could find offensive. But if someone has to write a report on @PERSON1, it would be best to have as much information on him as possible. I will make one compromise: if there is music being checked out with offensive language, they should provide it with both a clean and explicit version of the album.     There are ways that censorship can be good, and some ways that it could be bad. Some people find bad language and themes offensive, while others find that it gives freedom to the artist or author. I think that uncensoring things in the good and bad form is better than not uncensoring things at all",3,3
4272,"Do I believe that certain materials, suck as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? No I do not believe this statement for many reasons. If anybody cold take books off the shelves in the libraries, there would no longer be any use for libraries, students in school will have a harder time learning about certian topics in the world, it would defeat the purpus of having the ability of freedom of speech, we could easily avoid this problem if needed.     One reason I believe that taking books off the shelves is because, if we all have the right to take books we find offensive there would no longer be any books no the shelves. This would limit us the ability for students to learn about many important topics in the world. Just the other day I heard a lady telling her daughter that she was not going to allow her to go to school the day they have 'the talk', (sex education for students in grade six), because she thought she was too young to learn about that area of education. Yes, that @MONTH1 be true, but it also means that her daughter is not going to know about the many diseases you can get from underage, and or unpretected sex. This @MONTH1 lead her daughter to having sex at a young age and getting pregnate, or some kind of disease, that could have easily been prevented with a little education from library books, or a class at school.     Another reason I do not believe in the right of taking books from the shelves is because, when we are taking these books off the shelves, we are taking someones very hard work and just throwing it into the trash. In my opinion it is very disrespectful to the authors, and anybody else who was involved in writing those books. Just because you do not agree with what they are writing does not mean you can just throw it away. This would being defeating the purpose of haveing freedom of speech. Taking those books off the shelves is basically telling the authors that they are not aloud to write about what they want and publish it. It is also telling them that they are not allow to state thier oppinion.     This problem could easily be avoided if needed. For example, those books, music pieces, movies, magizines, etc., could be put in a seprate section of the library, and only make it availble to adults of a certain age. Have the books, and other writing pieces rated in the same way that movies are. This would be a very simple and effective way to solve this problem.     Like I mentioned earlier I strongly disagree with giving citizens the right to take certain materials, suck as books, movies, music, magazines, ect., off the shelves if you or anyone else find them offensive. It could effect the community in many ways, it is very rude and disrespectful to the autor of that piece of writing, and there are simple solutions to this problem",4,4
3102,"Picture yourself walking through the library with your child. Now think of how hard you worked to teach your child respect and manners. Imagine all of those values going down the drain by them reading one bad magazine or listening to one explicit song.      I agree with the censorship in libraries today. Most people wonder where their children learn curse words or sexual behavior and do not consider media as the problem. Libraries have continued to keep children areas clean of explicit materials and are careful so that magazines such as '@CAPS1' do not reach their shelves.     Explicit material should be removed if it is found offensive. I have seen offensive material get into the wrong hands such as kids. That childish innocence disappears when they hear songs about money, sex, and abuse. Some books could give them the wrong idea and encourage them to make unlawful decisions. One example is a teen pregnancy book. The ideas in the book are either to keep the baby and deal with the consquences or abort the baby and move on with life. Some media says to abort the baby just because it is easier. Would you want your child to have the idea in their head that they should react first before they think?     In conclusion, censorship should be kept in libraries. It helps everyone altogether not to worry about what wrong things their kids are doing, or how they snatched the wrong idea. Please help us promote censorship in libraries to make a more respectful environment.",3,4
3219,"I believe that libraries should provide any kind of book, magazine, music, and movies to the public, despite if they are found offensive.  First, to support my position, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore reads and prefers different types of books and magazines.  The same thing applies for watching movies and listening to music.  Second, what @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 be perfectly fine for another, so the term 'offensive' is ambiguous in this case.  There is no need for an angry public or strikes.  Finally, I believe that the people have a free choice when choosing the types of books and magazines to be read, the types of movies to be watched, and the types of music to be listened to.  After all, it is for their own benefit, entertainment, and learning.  So, libraries should not have anything offensive removed from thier shelves that are found offensive.     First, we need to take into consideration that every person is different, and therefore prefers different types of materials provided by a library.  For example, one person @MONTH1 like to read philosophical books, and the other @MONTH1 like to read romance comedy books.  If the philosophical books were to be taken off the shelves by the library officials, then the person who likes philosophy will not have anything to read.  Yes, there are magazines available and movies to watch about philosophy, but they are experienced and learned differently than reading  @ORGANIZATION2's book, or @ORGANIZATION3's @CAPS1.  I had an experience similar to this with my friend.  She preferred horror movies, and I historical.  The horror movie she was looking for was not in the library, and later it turned out that the library did not have any kind of horror movie because they weren't popular in that city.  My friend was not happy.  The library had historical movies, but I ended up watching that by myself. So, libraries should not have to take away any sort of material that might be offensive to the public.     Second, the term 'offensive' in this case is ambiguous, meaning that it has multiple meanings.  What @MONTH1 seem 'offensive' to one person @MONTH1 not seem offensive to another.  An example:  a @CAPS2 @CAPS3 magazine cover @MONTH1 be offensive to a child because of the picture and 'adult' words for the child.  However, that same cover @MONTH1 be interesting to a young adult because he @MONTH1 be into surfing, suntanning, or @CAPS2.  Offensive is only used in the first part, but not in the second, and the same material was used.  So, should that magazine be removed? I don't think so.  The solution is for the child to look at @CAPS4 Magazines, @ORGANIZATION1, or @CAPS5 magazines.  The library should provide a section for @ORGANIZATION1 so that they can read appropriate material.     Finally, I believe that the peole have a free choice when choosing the books to read, the type of movies to watch, and the types of music to listen to.  They should be allowed to do this because of their differences and their definition of 'offensive'. People should not be forced to read the same type of book, to watch the same type of movies, or to listen to the same type of music.  They should have a choice of choosing the materials provided by the library which corresponds to their personalities.  After all, the materials they see, read, or listen to is for their own benefit, their own learning, and for their own entertainment.  The main goal is for them to be happy with what the library has to offer.     In conclusion, I belive that libraries should not take off any material from their shelves that are found offensive.  This is due to the different people, the ambiguous term for 'offensive', the for the sake of human flourishment.  Libraries are for studying, learning, and entertainment in a quiet, peaceful place.  They should not discourage people to discontinue learning about the world because that would lead to a bigger and more serious worldwide problem: the lack of education.",4,4
3318,"New @CAPS1 in the @CAPS2 @CAPS3     Have you ever seen a movie or read a book that you did not want your kids/family to read? I know I have, and sometimes there is no stopping them from seeing or reading those books/movies. I don't necessarily think the offensive books should be removed, but I think they should be relocated to a different part of the @CAPS3. This @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 should only be entered by an adult, or with an adults permission.     Little kids see stuff that their peers are doing and want to be just like them so they do the same stuff. What the kids don't realize is that most of it is fake, and the things that happen in movies aren't really true. By having this seperated @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3, it gives parents the chance to get the racist, drug/gang filled, and murder books away from the children. This will be good for every race too! If an african american family does not want there child to be reading books about slavery or gangs, they can keep them out of the @CAPS1 of books where slavery and gangs are. Some books are really emotional and can trigger a persons emotions. If someone is going through a really hard time and they read a book about suicide, they are more likely to think about killing themself.      I think by separating the bad influencing books from the good influencing books it well help alot. People under the age of @NUM1 are not permitted to be in this @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3 without a parent, or parent signature. So come on down to the @CAPS2 council on @DATE1 and vote for the new @CAPS1 of the @CAPS3! Thank you for your time.",3,3
3620,"People today always seem like they are trying to find something offensive.  The problem with the @ORGANIZATION1 is that it always feels like it needs to appease these people.  The truth is that when you have as many as there is in a country, there are going to be many different ideas, thoughts, likes, and dislikes.     Libraries are places of knowledgee.  They keep many differnt books, magazines, and movies there, so that people with all different tastes can enjoy the library.  Most people, with books, figure out early what genre of books, which authors, and how long of books they like.  So books are usually very hard to offend people, because most people can usually tell right away if they like the book or not.     Magazines are like books in away.  People know what they want.  With magazines though, people ususally just flip threw the pages, and skim through articles. They will keep skiming through the magazine, until they find that perfect article they want to read.  Usually after that, they are done with the magazine.     Music has been around almost as long as mankind has been around.  There is something about music that soothes the human body.  Music is one of those things that ais constantly changing with time.  Before instruments, music was just purely voice, but as the centuries went on, music became more advanced.  Now it would be nice if there was just one type of music that everybody liked, but there isn't.  There are so many types of genres of music, that it would be hard to find a person in this world that liked every type of music.     There are people who hate change. Likewise thet don't like to change there favorite music types.  But if people changed with time, then there would really only be a  few types of music.  But since there are many types of music, there is always going to be someone out there in the world that doesn't think that song shouldn't be played.     Just in the last century movies have came along way in advancement.  Movies use to be simple, they would have a simple plot, and everyone loved it.  But there are so many people who love to see technology advance, that they want movies to change.  Movies today are all about special effects, love, sex, alcohol, parties, fighting, and the list could go on and on.  Directores try to make the best movie possible, so its almost like they try to put just enough of one thing to keep the audience into the movie.  But if they go overboard on a subject, that is when at least one person has a red flag go up in their head and think that is offensive.     Movies are suppose to be enteraaning, not something people should get offended by.  Movies are good about it though.  They have created a rating system to try give the audience a fair warning heads up, so that the audience knows what to suspect in the movie.     It doesn't matter what it is, book, magazine, music or movie, there is always going to be someone who doesn't like it or is just offended by it.  There is nothing to do about that, and it's not a bad thing.  It's just simply means everyone in this world is not the same.  So I think we can all come up with the conclusion that: just because one person doesn't like something, doesn't mean the next person will",4,5
4341,"'' I feel that materials, such as book,music, movies, magazines, etc., should not be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive.

3607,"In libraries and bookstores worldwide books are written and published with subject matter ranging from odd or inappropriate, to serious or violent. These books are written to target emotions in the reader that spark excitement and humor, horror and empathy among many others. However, though these books are made for a specific purpose, it is sometimes unclear as to how the book is appropriate for the eyes of a young reader, or even a mature reader. These books appear unappealing and offensive. However, though they don't appeal to you as a reader, how could this book be censored without the unanimous disapproval of everyone? Censorship of these books is unjust because of the right of free speech and press, because all subjects are deserving of being written, and most importantly because target audiences deserve books written in their interest regardless of their approval.     The first reason that their should be no censorship of novels and works of literature is because writers deserve the freedoms of speech and press. They are aloud to voice their own opinions and write about the subject matter that they are most interested in. Though many times they have used subject matter that is highly provocative or inappropriate, they still have the capacity and the legal ability to write about what they wish. To stop them from writing their own opinionated stories is similar to the censorship of books in nazi @LOCATION1. Millions of books were burned and hundreds, if not thousands of writers were executed for conveying opinions in their work that conflicted with the ideas of their government. Even though there are books not written for all ages they are still deserving of a reader.     The next reason that books should not have censorship is because new ideas cover topics that have never been discussed. Books and stories are meant to push the mark of what has been written and what can be written. The variety of literature is the reason why it is so popular. For thousands of years, written text has been a way to understand and connect with cultures and people through written language. And though stories @MONTH1 not be written in a manner that would be appropriate for a child, it doesn't mean that the story shouldn't be written or read. Its use should simply be monitored so that only those capable of accepting or understanding its message are capable of reading it.     Lastly, censorship is simply unjust because without it there is a better chance to discuss and attempt to describe stories that target a vast crowd of people. Though the materials found in a story @MONTH1 be horrific to a parent, it @MONTH1 be a preferred form of literature for a different group of people. And to limit the literary subjects that people prefer could be parallelled with limiting a person's voice of opinion. It simply isn't reasonable to allow only a single category of work, with only a few varieties of messages, for only a select group of people. Variety is what seperates a person's opinions, and makes their being different than another's.     Therefore, censorship of literature should not be enforced. Writing topics should be open to all people, because whether they are offensive or not they convey a purpose. And because writers have the right to illustrate their points through a literal medium, there should never be a limit on these rights. That is why censorship should never be able to remove a piece of literature from any shelf.",4,5
3990,"Censorship is a tough topic to discuss. Everyone has different views on what is and isn't acceptable in libraries, because of the content in some books, music, movies, and magazines. When you start to censor what information is available to certain people, they get angry, and it can cause an uproar of protest. There should be an age limit on some materials however. So how can you tell what is okay for younger children and teens to view?     For movies, music, and magazines, there are already limitations on how old you have to be to buy or rent them. With movies, the rule in libraries should be the same as anywhere else. It should be that you must be seventeen to get anything rated @CAPS1. I'm not sure what the age is to view unrated movies is, but for libraries it shoulld be the same as anything else. Anything else, should be open to all ages.     Music is also a controversial material to censor. If a @CAPS2 has an explicit label on it, you should have to be eighteen to check it out. The reason being, is that some music can contain violent lyrics, and unless you are eighteen you shouldn't listen to it. When you hear music that is offensive to you, you must be smart enough to not listen to it. Anything any artist wants to say on a @CAPS2 can be recorded, and children should not be exposed to that until they are responsible enough to know what they should, and sometimes shouldn't be listening to.     Printed materials are the hardest to censor. Personally, i don't believe any book should be kept from anyone. The only type of book that should be kept from some people is magazines. Once again, magazines can contain some graphic content, and should only be kept from anyone under eighteen. There are just some things kids shouldn't see, but if you are a legal adult, and want to read any kind of book, it should be available to you.     With any of these materials, it should all be available to you in a library. It is a place to learn about how a writer, a movie director, a music artist, or magazine editor feels about the world. If we censor the material in a library, it is denying the public of the real world. Also, we would be revoking the right given to us of free speech. I do not make fun of books because I know whatever someone writes down, in their eyes, is the truth. It is an expression of self, and to stop someone's work from being available to the world, you are taking away the right of free speech.",4,4

While I read that book it had alot of offensive language and alot of graphic not only in the book but in the movie to. On top of all that both the movie and the book weren't good at all. The only thing good about the movie is @CAPS2 was a few dramatic and thats it. Another thing that caught my eye was when the author repeatedly kept on saying the same offensive language over and over again. It's like the liked to keep on saying the same old thing using repitions. But some how it got an award and is one of the must for high school student's. I think the story overall was alright beside the fact @CAPS2 was offensive in it though. Books like that shouldn't be put on shelves and if they are the need to take the offensive language out but obviously people liked the book or it wouldn't have awards.                                   So obviously 'To @CAPS3 A @CAPS4' was a good story but when it comes down to it could offend alot of people I hear people talking about the book still and I read it last year. So In @CAPS7, I think @CAPS2 should be censorship in libraries.",2,2
4035,"Readers of the @ORGANIZATION1,     Censorship in libraries should never be an issue. It is a very simple concept. Obviously, no one wants their children being exposed to inappropriate reading material or movies. If a child wishes to visit the public library, their parents shouldn't have to worry about what their children will be looking at there. A library should be a family-friendly place where children can get together for story time, or where college students can study. I remember going to the library all the time when I was younger. I would read a different story every week with a large group of kids in the community. It was something I enjoyed doing. Don't you want your community library to be a place where children can learn and enjoy themselves?     Unfortunately, some libraries do have offensive reading material, movies, music, etc. It is the responsibility of the library employees to put these offensive materials in the adult reading section of the building. Parents should tell their children that the adult section is off-limits, and the library employees should keep children from every being in that restricted area. These items @MONTH1 be offensive to some people, and they @MONTH1 be too inappropriate for children. However, there are some readers who have the right to look at these materials if they want. That's why they shouldn't be taken off of the shelves completely, just removed from the rest of the books, music, movies, etc.      I am not one to deny anyone their rights. Even though I don't personally see the need for offensive reading materials in a public library, that doesn't mean that someone else shouldn't get to view these items. All in all, we have to be fair. Would you want someone taking away your right to do something you like to do because they find it offensive? No, nobody wants that. However, we still have to be reasonable about it. If there are going to be adult reading materials in a community library, they have to be in an area where children aren't allowed. It's just common courtesy, and everyone has to cooperate. This is why censorship in libraries should never be an issue. I hope that you can see it my way, and help me in fixing this issue once and for all.

3357,"Books, movies, music, and even @CAPS1 are all important in this life, and enviorment of ours. They all have a learning process. When you read you learn, when you watch a movie you learn, even when you listen to music you can learn. Weather its about past present or future, everyone has the right to learn it's part of being a citizen.     Speaking of all this I belive just beacuse one book, or one movie makes someone uncomfortable i dont think that you should take that away. Thats not only taking away from your kid, or yourself thats taking away from everyone else. Just like the book huckleberry fin it's a wonderful book i love it because it's about the old days where they still belived in slavery, and there were still some good-hearted people around.     This book to some would be very offensive beacuse of the fact it has the word nigger in it one-hundered and twenty-seven times. In fact last year at my school a mother tried to get it taken out, because she didnt want her son to read it he was actually a mixed boy but thankfully the committee saved it and it's still here. That's our history and everyone needs to learn some of it, weather it's offensive or not.     As well as movies that can and mostly likely is offensive to people, they still should not have that stuff taken off either, like I said earlier thats taking away from everyone else. If you dont wanna see it then dont buy it, or if something that you find innapropriate comes on just change the channel. History is important and I dont think people should keep you from your right as a citizen and deprive you from learning what you wanna learn or need to learn for the future.      Now the music part i can understand, some @MONTH1 be a little innapropiate for younger listeners so like i said before again change the station or dont buy that @CAPS2. Dont deprive people of what they wanna learn, watch or listen to.     People that feel offended or embrassed should be ashamed of them self because that is very selfish, and rude. No one should be ashamed of who they are or any movie that describes the old days in the way it actually happened, if they put it in the nice way then it would all just be a lie. That's why I dont belive in censorship. It should not happen, any book, movie, magazine, @CAPS2 should be available to who wants it",3,3
4307,"Do you believe that certain materials; books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from the shelf if it is offensive to some people? Accordingly, I do not believe this way. If we were to take books off a shelf for everyone who thought it was offensive, we wouldn't have any books left on the shelf.     According to my prior knowledge, I know certain materials will affect different people in different ways.  I have had my own experience when in svhool. Some people do not want to say the pledge due to saying 'one nation, under @CAPS1.' We all have various opinions on subjects; so we all will react differntly.  However, that doesn't mean we should take away something he or she finds offensive; others find it appropriate.     Observing others when in offensive situations @MONTH1 help find a solution to these problems. The solution is certainly not to remove what some find offensive for many people will disagree until eternity.  Censorship in libraries should be based on seperation. Materials that fit under one catagory should be put in one section. Often times, this seperation helps people find what they need and not be offended.     In our own constitution it states that all @CAPS2 are free; freedom of speech in particular. All materials are written by someone with an opinion so by taking their books off the shelf, we are taking their freedom of speech away.  It is how they express themselves. If someone finds it offensive then they should quite simply not read it. Removing the material might frustrate and offend the author or other readers.     It is plain and simple: We shouldn't remove certain materials due to someone finding it offensive. Censorship in libraries should be based on seperation, not people getting offended easily. It's based on choices. People should get to choice what they want to read or watch without others taking it away from them. So now what do you believe; Should certain materials be removed",4,4
4108,"Dear @ORGANIZATION1,     @CAPS1 I was growing up in my small little neighborhood, life could not have been more simple.  For children, life is eating, sleeping, playing, and laughing.  Their innocent minds do not ponder the meanings of life or of love, but curiosity does grab every child now and then.  With a stubborn persistance, a child would probably go to the ends of the earth to understand what confidential information they overheard their parents talking about.  But @CAPS1 does harmless curiosity mean the destruction of a child's innocence?  By viewing adult-oriented material, such as books at a library, children can gain premature knowledge that can be harmful to their development.  However, libraries should not fear stocking their shelves with books that are appropriate for adults because an author spend countless hours writing that book,  that book represents a portion of history for the human race, and not everyone @MONTH1 find the contents inappropriate.     Authors have the freedom to write about whatever interests them, and taking away their right to display their thoughts and opinions is unjust.  A censored author must feel like a basketball player that did not make the cut despite hours of practice.  Thus, an author that has practiced and perfected his writing skill does so in hopes of publishing his work.  Not agreeing with someone's interest in a subject is no reason to exclude his valuable thoughts from society.  Books that are appropriate for adults deserve to be displayed for adults as the author intended.     Every piece of literature that has ever been written documents a portion of history of the human race.  Even fictional novels serve as monuments to the depths of man's imagination.  Therefore, no book should be censored, no matter how inappropriate the material is.  Just as remembering the @CAPS2 has influenced mankind not to repeat past mistakes, keeping books of the most horrible content @MONTH1 save authors from repeating such dishonorable content.  In other words, if censorship removes the 'mistakes' of literature from library shelves, who is to say that an oblivious author will not repeat that 'mistake'.  By remembering these mistakes, mankind will be able to move forward in literature.  @CAPS1 books are not 'mistakes', they serve as reminders of the high-points in literature.  All literature, appropriate and inappropriate, is a piece of mankind's history that should not be kept a secret.     Finally, who is to judge what is a 'mistake' in literature?  A book on @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be inappropriate in the eyes of a @CAPS4, but that book @MONTH1 be sacred to a @CAPS5.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  Furthermore, for any given book there is at least one person who disagrees with its message.  A library is built for the education of the public, not for the interests of one person.  If one is offended by a literary work, perhaps he should just move on and find a book more suited to his interests.  The decision on the appropriateness of a novel is up to the reader, not the government or library or activist group.     Censorship of material in libraries would strip authors of their chance to let their works be seen by others, keep records of the human race secret, and take away the privelage of the reader to decide what is appropriate.  Authors endure long hours of practice and writing in order to have their thoughts read, and such a motive should not be taken away from them.  Every book represents some aspect of human life and records it for future generations to avoid previous mistakes.  And these 'mistakes' are decided by the reader, a decision that censorship takes upon itself.  Instead of choosing what books are seen by the public, perhaps libraries should just create an adult-only section to house the 'controversial' books; as a result, mankind would stay educated and free, and children would remain innocent.                                   -@ORGANIZATION2",6,6

3525,"People have a choice on the types of literature they want to read wether it offends them or not the chose to read it. Books should not be removed from the shelves of libraries.They need to try to avoid the books that @MONTH1 be offensive to them. Now if they cant then thats not the libraries fault. Books should not be removed for many reasons.     One of the many reasons books should not be removed is because they know the risk they take when entering a library, and that's their decision that they are making and sometimes decisions have consequences. When and if they are offended, they will know the types of books that offened them so they would just have to do a little better job of avoiding those books.     Another reason would be the libraries dont know what offends people it can be one little thing in a book but that doesn't mean that book should be removed from the shelfs. Also just cause one person tihnks its offensive doesn't mean that others will. People arn't all offended by the same thing some people are offended by little things, meaning they're offended easily, some arn't offended so easy, that means it make take more serious things than a book to offend a person.     Another reason books shouldnt be removed is because students need them for projects and school assignments. Some school assignments require you getting a little offended exspecially if your african american and you get an assignment on slavery or something during that time. But we need to learn about past experiences and our history and we couldnt do that if some people are trying to remove some of those books from the shelf. You @MONTH1 get offended but there is no reason to remove that book that others will need at sometime.Find another way to solve that problem.     There are other ways to solve problems like these such as tagging the books with a yellow small sticker so it would warn people that the book offended someone. There is no need to completly remove the book. Another solution would be to maybe seperate the books, meaning put the books in a diffrent location of the library if the get more than a couple complaints of being offensive. Also when someone check out a book the librarian can warn them that the book has been tagged with a yellow sticker and its possible that it @MONTH1 offend them. Thats why removing books from shelves arn't cause for.",3,3
3756,"There are many books, types of music, movies, magazines, etc. that are found offensive to people. Should they be removed? It depends. If something is so inappropriate or offensive then it should be removed.      Today, there are many books that teach or give a bad message. If I see one, I just try ignore it; I do not pick it up and read the back or take it home and read it. I know what I am allowed and not allowed to read. But does that mean I should take it off the shelf and throw it away because I'm not allowed to read it? No. As much as I would like to, just to prevent others from reading it, I cannot. It is sad that we have to worry about these things in the first place.     I think the area where the most offensive things are, are movies. There are so many movies now that have inappropriate scenes: bad language, scary scenes, etc. Some movies are not rated appropriately either. There is a movie out now that is rated @NUM1 and is extremely scary. I cannot imgaine watching this movie as a middle schooler; I watched it as a sophomore and was scared. I never would have though it would have been that bad because of its rating. Some movies for children even have inappropriate things; they might be hidden and the child not understand, but it is still there. Why does it need to be there in the first place? Is it that important? No.     Another area that is bad, are video games. There are kids who play them so much, all they think about is killing, guns, and war. There are kids who think of these things so much they begin to think it is cool to point guns and knives at other kids. Some do it in a joking way, but others do not. These things are dangerous and hurt people-mentally and even emotionally.      You go to a grocery store or a gas station and see magazines with inappropriate things on them. No child should see those things, but if they are there anyone is going to look.     Different genres of music @MONTH1 even send bad messages. There are some radio stations that, with certain songs, bleep out words like drugs and alcohol, but with other songs that have curse words, keep them there. I do not really understand that. Yes, drugs and alcohol are bad, but why isn't a curse word? Just saying the words drug or alcohol are not bad.       These types of things are very offensive to people. But is there really anything they can do? Not really. We all have our opinions and we can speak our minds, but sometimes we do not get want we always want. We cannot really do anything about this. Others belive it is okay to watch and listen and read these kinds of things, but with the things we read, watch, adn list to on a regular basis are what we think about. If you put bad things in your mind that is all you will begin to think about and it will become a part of your life",4,3
4489,"In libraries there are some books,music,magaizines that are not very apporiate to put on shelves. There are little kids that will want to look at anything they can get their hands on. They are very mysterious when it comes to that.      There are bad books but there are also good books in the library. If people found a book or any type of material in the library and found it offensive, then they should take it off the shelf. There are children that look at anything they want or what they think looks interesting. The library also should at least check what the book is about when it arrives at the library. That way no one would have to worry about a material being offensive. Movies should not matter really because there are a lot of bad movies but i dont think that people would find them offensive. They dont have to watch it and neither do their children.      There is a lot of bad music. I think there should be censorship on music because some music today is about drugs,alchoal, and violance. People would not want to see that in their local library for their children to see. I have seen on the news people get upset when they see something that they think is inappropiate for underage children. I would get mad too because i dont want an underage child to be listening to that type of music. Children now look up to these song writers and want to become them. That is not a good thing at all.      All magazines can be offensive to people just by looking at the cover and who the cover person is. Libraries would not put a inappropiate magazine on the shelves. There are some magazines that they have but they are good magazines even for children to read. I think that the libraries dont put offensive magazines out because they dont want any controversy. People today have came out even more good magazines for anyone to read that is not inappropaite for anyone.      I think some people today dont realize that the library would want to offend anyone by putting those offensive magaizines,movies,books and music. Putting censorship on those things would be a good thing because there are materials that are not good for small children to read or hear or watch. The parents dont want their children looking up to a person who is involved in violence or drugs or alchoal. Censorship would be they way to go on all those materials just to keep away contoversy and the children safe.",4,4
3394,"What is appropriate in libraries these days? The opinions differ throughout the variety of different people across @LOCATION1.  Censorship has taken a turn in public libraries, but still has been strictly forbidden from school libraries. Personally, I think that there is a difference between vulger and inappropriate items in a public library versus a school library.      A public library is a place for anyone and anywhere to come and find an item that they are interested in. As we all know, everyone is different and have their own interests, so they should be able to find the book, music, etc. for them. The problem is, how do the libraries keep these uncensored objects out of children's hands? The answer should be simple. For thought, maybe all public libraries should be broken up into sections, each with their own subject matter. These different sections could include Children's, @CAPS1, and many more different titles. This set up is often used in well known book stores and libraries such as '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' and '@CAPS4'.  Overall, censorship in public libraries does not need to be as strict as school libraries.     School libraries are a whole different idea. School libraries are made to help assist the students' academic acheivement, nothing more and nothing less. However, I also think that the content in the school libraries also depends on the maturity of the students. For example, elementary and middle school libraries should have a stricter censorship than high school libraries. The students in high school should be mature enough to handle uncensored material without creating a huge scene, like we all know younger students would do. I have personally seen and witnessed a few so called 'inappropriate' books on the shelf at my high school library, but the readers of the book have been mature about reading it. I believe that some offensive and vulger items can be interesting and educational. It is all a part of growing up.          The censorship in our libraries today vary from each library to the next. School libraries and public libraries are completely different places of literate and media content. I think that it is a person's own personal decision dealing with which library they go to. If a family with young children want to go to the library, the parents need to choose the appropriate areas in the building to search for the children. Therefore, there should be no problem in running across a 'bad' book. The author, @PERSON1, states, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf... And then we have no books left on the shelf for anyone.",3,4
4678,"A lot of people have huge debates over what they think is appropriate for children and teens to be reading, watching, and listening to; in this topic there will be opinions discussed and logical explanations to what some people think is the proper things kids should be exposed to.     First, kids should not be watching rated @CAPS1 movies or even @NUM1 if it has vulgar content, sexual content, violence, and etc. Even though some parents allow this, these movies and magazines can still have a huge impact on the child and possibly on how they act in his or her future.     Secondly, children still have a good number of movies for them to watch and learn from that can better themselves for their education, career, etc.     Finally, teens and young adults exposed to this genre of movies, books, music, or any other media based entertainment are more likely to make destructive decisions than a teenager who doesn't. Although this is not always the case, it does increase the chances of wrong decisions and it does have and influence on the younger minds.     In conclusion, young adults, teens, and children should not be able to watch media that contains vulgar content, sexual content, voilence, etc, without parent supervision and permission.",3,3
3773,"If you are sitting in the librarie and you are minding your doing your homework and studing for a test next hour, I wouldn't thank you would want to be messed with.Would you? Well im going to explan what I think about everything that's in the libraries. Like some stuff we should have in their and some stuff we shouldn't. I beleave you should have no problems with noise or anything while you are trying to study in a librarie.      There are some things in the world today that alot of people find offensive. Their are like people that are offensive and things that go on in our and your area were you live that are really offensive. When it comes to our libraries there are some things that need to be change and some thing that don't need bothered. There are some book some kids shouldn't be seeing in the libraries but to other people mite enjoy them. But I don't beleave that they should be taken off the shelf. They just need to be placed better where smaller kids can't get to easy.     You wouldn't like for some books taken off of the shelf because somebody thought they were not good for kids. They just need to be move to a shelf were only bigger kids can get to. When I am studying I like to listen to music. It helps me think what I am going and calms me down. But when I don't have my music playing I don't like when other people have there to loud. Thats one thing that need to be changed in the libraries. Some movies are really offensive and they should be removed from the shelf. Another thing that has been a problem is magazines. There are alot of all kinds of magazines with all kinds of stuff to read about and they need to be watched. I beleave if anything is offensive it should be taken off the shelf.      Some people freak out every easy and this world is every offensive and people need to think about other people. If they don't somebody mite take it the wrong way and it could get bad",3,2
3867,"In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? Many people @MONTH1 feel upset if they find a book or magazine or any type of material that is inappropiate for anyone to see/hear.         Inappropiate material is commonly referred to as pictures and or words that @MONTH1 offend people. The words in songs can be offensive. Talking about girls in disrespectful ways in music can offend girls and listeners. Pictures can also be offensive in many ways such as sex, race, and violence.      I believe that, if a book, music, movies, or magazines upset you then you should stay away from that section or just that material in particular. If you have been to a library you see that kids mainly stay in the kids section anyways; and if you're an adult then you should be mature enough to ignore what bothers you. I have been in a library a few times in my life. When I search for what im looking for, I ignore what offends me or upsets me.      In a library, should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? My answer is no, for the reasons I have listed above. People should be mature enough to stay away from and not let the offensive materials in a library get to them",3,3
4361,"Are offensive materials offensive to everybody? Does everyone think the same material is offensive? Who is to say what is or is not offensive? Offensive material can be anything someone wants to think of. Children are going to see this material anyways, weither we take it away of not. Offensive material, such as cursing or rage, is a form of expression and of releaving stress. Such things can also show anger, hate, and depression.      Children will see and hear offensive things anyways. Even as it is now, parents try to hid such things from their children. this makes them curious. They will do anything to understand it. Offensive things are part of everyday life. The more you hid it, the more children will seek it out.     In movies, books, and music, this is a form of expression. it releaves stress, rage, and shows this so that @CAPS1 is a true picture of what is going on. People cannot imagion someone truly angery in a book when it says, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You don't know what you have done!'...' You cannot show foreshadowing, or show the anger. You cannot see how a character truly feels. For example, '... and she says with grief and anger, 'You are wrong! You will parish! You don't know what you have done! Death will come!'...' @CAPS1, you have an idea of how the author will play out the story and how the character really feels. You can see the foreshadowing. The author could be saying that a good man has died, who was going to stop evil, or an evil man died, and people will revenge him.     In such ways, this can show anger. Some people would find the example offensive or out of line. Cursing to me is not offensive. But, they show how the character, writer, or singer feels when it was written without it having to state it. Offensive material can also grief. This shows that someone is hurt by what has happened, amplifying the story. allowing the reader, watcher, or listener to expect more and want more. So the reader, watcher or listener would wait for more, and by the music, book, or movie. It puts intrest into the material.     Only certain people can agree on something offensive. Such as family, friends, or a group of close people. But, it applies foreshadowing, intrest, anger, grief, and sometimes, passion. Your children will see it if they truly want to. So, why get rid of something that they will see anyways? Something that intersts them and makes them want to read more, watch or make movies, or listen to or make music. Why would something that, yes, is offensive to some, but would grab promote and keep some within it",4,4
4559,"As Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf.' As an author, she feels if she, and anyone else, has the right to take those uncensored books off the shelf, then there will be no books left. Depending on the person, some books @MONTH1 be offensive to some, but not all. I dont think that books should be able to be taken off the shelf by anyone because everyones preference on books can be different. I believe that libraries should keep unsensored books in a certain section, so children can easily be kept from seeing or reading unappropriote material at their age. And lastly, my own experience has led me to believe there should be a warning on certain books, saying not all the material could be appropriote.     People having the right to take any book off the shelf would be unfair for the people. The library is a quiet place, meant for people to come and read any type of book, do homework, study groups, and undergo research for practiaclly any topic, @CAPS1 the number of books based on one persons opinion is unfair to everyone else who might enjoy that genre. Libraries and books were one of the main resources for researching before there was internet and many eople still prefer books to this day. I think the freedom of taking any book off the shelf would be endangering the process of learning and discovering     To reduce the number of uncensored books being found by children or people who find them offensive, there should be a certain section in the library for just those books. That way, people who have an interest in those books can read them, but also they are kept away for those who dont want to read them. I think taking away any type of book is unfair to the people because everyone like different genres of books, so having uncensored books in one section is fair to all. It would also be easier on parents knowing their children wont find books with material in them that they shouldnt be reading.      By disagreeing with the right to take any book off the shelf, I think each book with any uncensored material should be marked with some type of sticker on the binding, just as a warning. If one sees that sticker and knows they dont want books with that type of material, then they can easily return the book with no argument. I have had experience with trying to find a book for a school project, but later finding there was material in it that really wasnt appropriote for school. This made me have to find a new book for the project. I didnt want to completely take the book off the shelf and away from any one else who wanted to read it, but a warning right then would of been easier in the situation.      In conclusion, I dont believe that certain materials should be taken off by just anyone. Taking away books would spark many disagreements because even though one person might find something offensive, doesnt mean every other person will. As mentioned before, putting the uncensored books in a different section and putting a sticker on the binding would give a clear warning to anyone not wanting to read unsencored books. I think every library needs to take into consideration of the topics above to help people reduce the issue of people or children finding uncensored books in just any section",4,4
3104,"The media is destroying our youth! this is something we hear everyday. Teachers are telling us this, while parents and grandparents are telling us how mush different their world used to be. They explain how the media of their time wasn't as open about sex and violence. They go on to say how they didn't have violent video games teaching children that killing is alright. Because of these people, we think that the media is repsonsible for the wrong in the world of @DATE1. The truth is that it isn't the medias fault, it is the parents. It is the parents responsiblity to teach the children of the world the difference between right and wrong. If these such parent do their jobs correctly then the youth of @DATE1 will not need for everything to be censored. It is my firm belief that their should not be any censorships. When their is censorship people can govern what we learn, destroy what goes agiainst their beliefs, and destroy our god given right to freedom of speech    Censorship will detroy the knowlege available @DATE1. We have had seen censorship in our history. When we look back we see that the @ORGANIZATION1's censored and destroyed anything that went against them. We hated it when they had book burnings and destroyed the custums, art, and music that the government felt was wrong for their people. How would we be any different if we did it. We could potentailly be destroying somones way of life. We would be destroying what could possibly be tomorrows masterpeice. In censoring we would be detroying history.By destroying history we would be detroying the brilliance that is learning.     If we allow censorship anything that goes against our own personal beliefs would be destroyed. If you ask any christian if they would allow their children to read the muslim book of faith, the @LOCATION1, they would tell you no. It would be the same if you asked a muslim if they would let their children read the @CAPS1. The point is that if their is cansorship we would be destroying other peoples beliefs. No one has the right to govern what others believe in the world.     Also in censorship we would be exterminating our freedom of speech and the freedom to express ourselves. If we don't allow peole to read what someone else has written because we believe it is wrong, then we are taking away their ability to learn new ideas because everyone has different opinionsand theories. Every newspaper would shut down because they would all be saying the same thing. No one would want to read them because they would already know what they would hav eto say. When we start giving up rights such as freedom of speech we will not be able to stop those people who took those right from taking more.      Of course their will always be things in the media, in books, and in music that we don't like.Their will be cursing, nudity, and violence everywhere we turn. This is not because we want it there, but because these things are a part of life. They are the dark parts that we dont want to see.  If you dont want to see dont look. Just dont close everyone elses eyes because you dont like what you see.     Our learning, our beliefs, and our freedom of speech are too important to just give up to censorship. We cannot alow others to dictate, in this matter, what is right for us. Our media is too intertwined with our lives. Who's right is it to decide what is right for our lives. If we start giving up these small freedoms then those taking them from us will not stop. They will just keep taking what freedoms we have until we are nothing more that a dictatorship",5,5
4574,"Where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3     @CAPS4 up noone wanted to read, it's to hard or I don't want to. The best way to get out of reading was reading a magazine. Sure, it's educational but it also can demoralize some people's thoughts and feelings. One way to get rid of this problem is censorship, or taking a specific book out of the hands of the public.     We all have poked fun at people, whether it is to hurt them or just give them a hard time, it can hurt people. Same way with the media. Books, magazines, @LOCATION1, and the internet all are competing for the success and money of its viewers, and the best wat to do that is to appeal to the audience. Give them what they want. For some reason everyone wants to demoralize people, and that is where I think it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3. Stand up for your rights and censor out those things that will lead to worse lives of those to come.     Censorship @MONTH1 just be a big word to most people, but it carries a big problem. For me, it @CAPS1 the @CAPS3 whenever racism is a problem or else vulgarity is an obscene message. The music we listen to can get really intense. I'm a victim of the harsh music that we play more and more of today. Atleast the radio is trying to do better at this whenever they 'bleep' out the curse words or else persuade the artist to make clean lyrics that they play on air. That is where places are trying to clean things up. Make tomorrow be a better place than today.     With all of these new @CAPS5 (Music @CAPS6) shows and other reality sitcoms making air on @CAPS6, it has opened the door to crudeness all over. They try to do a better job of cleaning it up in the sense of picture, censoring out body parts and on the worldwide coverage stations their mouths. Other stations like @CAPS5 don't do anything about the voices and the vulgarity people are showing and feeling towards each other.     Books are another thing that could use some censorship. @CAPS2 teacher used to tell me, '@CAPS8, if you can't read it out loud to me, then you shouldn't probably be reading it.' and I agree. With the technology and all the other things, children are more vulnerable to these harsh words and actions. Thus, leading towards a society who can't trust anyone and easily turns to vulgarity when need be.     With the world today, it is quiet easy to listen to the uncensored version that is shed from the radio. One person tries to make tomorrow a better place but the next tries to demoralize it. It's one thing if your angry and upset and are standing up for your rights but it's not whenever you do it for the fun of it. That is where it @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3",4,4
3890,"Why should books that some people enjoy to read be removed off of library shelves?  That is ludacris. There are so many alternatives then to just take those certain books off the shelves completely.     We all have seen or heard of books that are inapropriate to certain audiences.  It is understandable that young children should not read or be associated with these kind of materials such as: books, magazines, poems, movies, songs.  It is totally unnecessary for children to be reading such explicit material, but it is possible for us to prevent it.       One way libraries throughout the nation can prevent this is by making a complete different libraries or have the explicit materials be located in the total opposite side of the library from the children's materials.  I know that libraries tend to have opposite corners of the library dedicated to adult materials and childrens materials, but there should be more strict rules of kids being in the adult section.       Another idea is to have parental permission on the child's own library card telling the librarian, when the child checks out a book, where in the library they can get a book.  For example maybe the childs' parents only will allow him/her to get materials from the children's section in the library; therefore if that child wants a material from a different area of the library they cannot get it, unless his/her parents are their telling the librarian the child is allowed to get it.       I know when i was a child and i couldn't do something that my parents were doing, it made me feel upset, but now that i look back i realize why they wanted me not to do what they were doing.  They wanted me to be a child as long as possble.  They knew if i was reading or listening inapropriate materials then i was growing up way too fast.  I know that now and understand it now what they wanted for me.     To conclude, lets keep those filthy books and magazines away from the younger kids.  I don't want to see it get banned from the libraries or taken out of libraries; I just want to see parents stepping up to be parents and not letting their young children be exposed to that kind of thing.  It isn't the libraries faults if people's children are being exposed to this explicit material; it's the parent's fault for letting it happen",3,4
4728,"I do not think that there is a need to remove offensive materials from libraries. Some people @MONTH1 find these things offensive, but I think that others will be greatly offended if they remove these things.      Take rap music for example. There are many people that think that the lyrics of those  songs are just terrible and offensive. Other people think that rap music is amazing. I do not think rap is very good at all, but I would not go the extent of saying that rap songs should not be played on the radio, and that the @CAPS1 should not be sold in stores. The same thing could be said for these materials in the library. Some @MONTH1 find them offensive but others greatly apreciate it.     Some people @MONTH1 be interested in these topics. Just like some people @MONTH1 be interested in fantasy or comedy. It would not be  fair for libraries to remove these materails from the library, and deny the people that do like them the rite to rent these materials.     Another factors is the maturity of the reader. If the person who is reading book or viewing movies that @MONTH1 be offensive is viewing them for clear interest then is no problem with it. But if the reader is not reading for interest, then there is a problem there. It all depends on the maturity that people have when they enter a library. The materials in libraries are there to give everyone a chance to find something that interests them. Just because someone else @MONTH1 find those materials offensive is no reasons to take them off the shelf.     I can see why some parents @MONTH1 be upset that their kids @MONTH1 see some of the things in the library that @MONTH1 not be apropriate, but all the libraries that I have been to have a had a special area for kids materials. If the parents where woried about their kids seing some the questionable materials they could bring the kid to that area.     I dont think that these materials that @MONTH1 seem offensive to some people should be removed from libraries. Everyone is going to be affended by something and it is not fare to deprive others of those materials even it is offensive to some.",4,4
4104,"There are thousands of books in libraries now a days, some are from @NUM1 years ago. Books are books, and anyone at any age should be able to remove any type of book off of a shelf. Books, music, movies and magazines are all mad to interest people and what they enjoy reading. Authors and publishers should not be pentalized for their hard work they achieved.      There are many people in the world, who like all different types of books. But just because a book has censorship inside the story doesn't mean any human being will enjoy the story. I enjoy reading stories about romance, and I'm sure there is censorship inside a romance story.     I only prefer romance stories, and if every single romance story had censorship and libraries removed the books from the shelves, I wouldn't read any type of book. Because I only enjoy reading about the romance. I only find adults and young adults reading romance stories, and these people have the matureness not to act out about censorship.     It's not best to ruin the stories for adults and young adults who like to read about the censorship inside of stories. There many be people who find it so interesting, that if it's based on a true story then they would want to be willing to help the person out based on the situation.      Don't take away the chance for these authors to succeed more in life. Let these young adults read about everything they are interested in. I'm sure there are many different people who would be upset if the censored stories were eliminted from the shelves in libraries",3,3
3921,"There are many different styles of  literature and media in this world.  With this variety, it has to please at least one person. If not, why was it made? There come a point when things just become too much. Some media and literature has passed this point and it should not be allowed on shelves.       Media is a huge influence in todays society.  What would you do without it?  Everyday, everyone is using media related, whether it is turning on the televison in the moring and watching the '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' to opening up a magazine and reading about what famous person is in jail this time.  You cannot get away from it. Teens @CAPS1 are truely addicted for the most part. We have video games, online chats (facebook and myspace), and moives.  Many things we learn from these are not good for our minds and health.   Some video games are good to play but when you become wrapped up in them, playing non stop, killing people and laughing at this, here you know there is something wrong.  Our minds are exposed to so much immorality and violence, so we think it is okay to do. Many people see it as, the movie stars do it, so why can't we?  @CAPS1's society is killing our minds and many young people who think their life is miserable just go out and commit suicide.       Music can get too extensive as well.  Yes, you have you oldies, country, and the jazz but when you add in the rap and heavy metal music, there is no understanding. Rap is all about who am I going to sleep with next and how many times I can have sex. Really, is this what our lives should be focused on? I didnt know people like the thought of a @CAPS3.  Heavy metal music, you cannot understand it, but when you research the words you see that life is useless and why are we living?  People say that this music helps them calm their anger down. Feeling realived after they have listen to it. You @MONTH1 be clam now but after hearing these words and banging your head around, what is going to happen when you do get extrememly mad?        Too many lives are effect by @CAPS1's media and literature. Lives of friends have been lost and friendships have been ruined.  Someone is always going to say a certain amount is too much, but I think we need to set a goal of how much is too much and try to save ourselves.  We are not like a video game that has seconds lives",3,4
3305,"Why should books or other such ideas but lets get back to the subject. Should certain books be aloud to be in a libary. Cause if u dont have certain books you would have to read the same book over and over. But there are all kinds of books that you can pick you have history,poems,dramas,love,scary. But some are not aporpit for certain places.     Certain music is ok but there are some that I would not aprove of. Like there rap its a bunch of people rymes. That people think up in there heads about life. Something that they want to express by telling raping. There is rock in roll alot of people did not care for it.     When it was intruduces in the late @NUM1 but as time went on people started listening to it. But alot of people did not want there kids listening. To that back then they said it was devil music. But in this day in age alot of people still listen to rock n roll. Cause they were brought up on that kind of music.     Movies there is a lot of diffent movies out there. There @NUM2 and rated @CAPS1 but alot of partents do not let there kids. Watch certain movies because they scare there kids. They are so ugly and gross that some people cant stand it. But there are shows for kids to there like a movie but a little shorter.     Magazines just are a new thing that people are trying out. But mostly old people read magazines cause they have alot of time on there hands. But there are some people who cant get ehogh of magazines. Cause they want to buy every thing in the book. It catchs there eyes bye the way it looks . But there is all kinds of diffent magazines mucle, food ,cleaning, toys.      But thats what I think about this kind . Of stuff it sucks people in but some cant get out. By the time they get out they are broke",3,3
3943,"What I do think is that they should keep everything in the library. Some people like to stay and read the newspaper and listen to music while out in the library. If you do think it's offensive, then don't read it or just pick out another book. Everybody has their own ideas on a library and if they want their voices heard let them speak it out.      What I think about all this stuff in the library these days are good for the kids so they can learn faster and have a lot more to look forward to when they do get older. My own experiences in the library that I do see that there is a lot more people in the library and there is a lot more you can do instead of reading books most of the time. You can read magazines or newspapers to pass the time when no one is home or to hang out with, and it does get boring just reading books so try something different for a little while then go back reading the book that you did start with and wanted to take a break from.      Then other people have their own voice to say something if they don't want it in their library. Some of my observations that I have seen were not really good. I've seen some protesters in front of the libraries and I have seen them close down because of it. But people sometime can take it to far and do sometimes burn it to the ground. I have seen people cry over it and it makes me really upset that I want to do something to help them but I really can't do nothing.      The most valueable thing is the kids and young children that read the books. What if someone burn down you home, this is how these kids feel when you close down the most safe place to them? They have the biggest voice of everybody put together. That if you do something that make them feel better that would be really good to them. That they have not done anything to deserve this kind of mess that we put them through. It is very difficult to have somewhere to go to read but there is nowhere to go.      If you don't want to be quiet then let your voice be heard aroud the world and have the freedom to let it come out. You have three diffenent voices your own, other people that do or don't agree and you have your children. So which one are you going to listen to? When you have a choice and you have to make it and hope you make the right one",4,4
3161,"I believe that libraries shouldnt be censored becuase people take offense to something. Everyone should be able to read, research, or watch anything they want at a library. I say this becuase everyone takes offense to something, If people can't find what they're looking for then why go to the library, also everybody likes diffrent things. I'll support them in the following paragraphs.     Have you ever read or seen something that u took offense to you or others? normally when someone takes offense to something they try to get rid of the thing offending them. If people where to take away things that offended them in librarys what would be left of the shelfs? dust? Becuase there are many things that people take offensive, everyone is diffrent. This is one reason I support no on censorship becuase there would be nothing left.     Also everyone tends to like many diffrent things. I @MONTH1 like something you could possibly hate, should it not be aloud in a library becuase you don't like it? No, becuase something you like could be taken away by someone else. So if everyone tried to take away the thing they don't like this would be another thing were nothing would be left. I think that becuase if we combined everyones things that they hate, it would most likely be everything.     These two subjects bring me to my last reason, if people cant find what they want. Becuase it was taken away, why come to a library? People would just stay home to read what they like on the internet and librarys would become empty like there shelfs. Then it was a waste of money to make the building, purchase the books for people, and hire librarians. Thats wasted tax dallors we could have used for something better.     After reading all my reasons and opinions I hope you can agree on not having censorship in libraries. becuase everyone is offended by something, everyone likes diffrent things, and noone would use a library if what they liked wasn't there. some people @MONTH1 disagree with me becuase they're one of these people being offended or not liking something. But say no to censorship, let our libraries do what there for, allow people to read, research, adn watch what the want.",3,3
4640,"Taking books off a shelf at libraries because someone thinks they are offensive? I dont think that is right. Thats just what one person thinks and other people I'm sure won't think the same way. Just because one person think something is offensive and should be taken off that shelf doesn't mean that some kid couldn't learn from that book. Also with music, movies, and magazines, well that you can get that everywhere else so why is it such a bad thing to have it a library?   A lot of kids go to libraries to find books they need for school and if people are taking books off the shelf that they need, then how are they supposed to get their work done? Im sure there are people out there that would say the books they need are something they shouldn't be leaning yet, but we are going to have to learn about it sometime, so why not now?   Taking away music? kids can just get on the internet and get that just as easy and most kids are doing it in ways that could get them in trouble. So having music at libraries is just giving them a free way to get it.   Magazines you could just go to a store and get but a lot of kids probably don't have the money to buy them so having them at a libraries would give them a way to be able to see them. As long as it is stuff that kids can see then i don't see what is wrong with libraries having them there.   So i think taking books, music, magazies, and movies away form libraries isn't a very good thing to do. Maybe they could make an adult area and if someone tells them they think a book should go in there then they can look over it and see if it should. I can see some stuff getting taken away but not very much and if you take all that away from a library then you dont really have much of a library anymore.",4,4
3274,"In our world today, there is a way to find anything that you could ever want under one roof.  People call these buildings libraries.  Libraries hold almost every book ever writen and offer them to the public free of charge.  If you can not find what you are looking for in a book, they also have many other resources: movies, music, magazines, and the internet.  I am not here to say that we should band any materials that are offensives because everything is offensive to somebody.     There is always somebody out in the world that would say they are offened just to make a point or to get attention in our world today even if they did not even care about the subject at hand.  The internet can take you to just about any thing that you would ever want to go to.  Yes, the libraries do have blocks on the internet for websites that are very outragously offensive, but people have learned how to get around the blocks.     Libraries are set up to where all the kids materials is in one location, all the teenage stuff is in another spot, and all the adult materials are in another room.  As a young child, I liked going to  libraries and having fun and reading, but the one thing I never did was go to the adult room and I think many other other kids feel the same way.  In fact, I have never seen a child in the adult section of a library.     Movies and music have ratings and if the rating is over what the child should be watching, then the child can not check the movie or music without a parent's signiture.  This ensures that kids can not check out bad or offensive materials without parental consent.     Our libraries are set up just fine the way they are and I feel we should not try to change the libraries in any way.  Movies and music have rating and kids can not check out offensive materials.  The materials in a library are organized by age group and kids usually do not venture out of the area of their interest.  Last but not least, if we took out everything in libraries that are offensive, then we would know longer have libraries in our communities.",4,4
4775,"Yes we should keep the books,music,movies,an magazines.     The magazines an music might not be a good thing for some us for must people use music to consutrate on doing work an magazines help us on getting topics for class work. why would some one take books or any thing that help us in life, so the person who wants to take book away should live the books or anything eles alone. So to this yes we should keep the books,music,movies, an magazines on the shelfs. We need to start fighting for what we want an how we want it should not be know ones eles chioc to deside what is good for us.",2,2
4285,"Do people take offensive books serious. There are lots of stuff in book that people @MONTH1 think is offensive. Some other people @MONTH1 think differently. I pretty sure libraries have censored shelves, but if not people shouldn't get so worried about it and here are ways.     I feel that certain materials that young people see in books, music, and movies are at the library. They see stuff that's around them. they also see what there mentor and parents are doing/watching too. The author of the quote (Katherine Paterson) can't just blame it all on the library.     In the paragraph I wrote before this I said that children see things that there metor and parents are doing. Now today in the @NUM1 century parents really don't keep a good eye things and what they leave out for what they child can get. Kids like to play with stuff they first see. If parents don't want there child seeing offensive material and other stuff on the shelves in a library then they should watch what they kids are doing more carefully and watch over their backs.     I really don't care that the shelves in libraries are offensive. I just don't pay any attention to it anyway. We are living in a better world that it was years ago. If people still are getting mad over petty stuff like that, then what are they still here for. When young children get older they are going to end up seeing things that they coudn't see that's still going to be on the shelves in a library.     We shoudn't take books offensive. After all they are just words on a piece of paper. I believe that offensive materials and other stuff should stay on the shelves of library. Besides some people need to know the truth sometimes in order to understand stuff more clearly.",3,3
3200,"I believe that censorship should be allowed when it comes to certain things but I don't believe censorship belongs in public libraries.  Books are wrote to stimulate the imagination of a persons mind and if they cannot read books that are the slightest offensive, then they will never know what it is like to open some of the greatest books ever wrote until that person has grown up.  And there are several studies that show that books stimulate the human mind and taking away these books would be a crushing blow to those statistics.     For example, a student has been assigned a report on a piece of classical literature.  So he/she goes to the public library to find a good book, but when that student gets the he/she finds out that all pieces of classical literature have been removed from the library due to being overly offensive.  What would that person do?  Should he/she just give up because every single piece of classical literature has been taken out of every library in the country, I say no!       This is a problem because almost every great book ever wrote has at least a few parts where it is slightly offensive to that certain reader.  From personal experience I can back this statement up with books I have read going through my school career.  For example, when I was in the @NUM1 grade  was assigned a book report over @PERSON1, so I went to our library in the school to look for this book and it was nowhere to be found.  I asked the librarian where this book was and she said that it had been removed due to being offensive to the black population for having the word negro inprinted on its pages.  So I asked her if I could go tot the public library to get the book and she said that it had been removed from its shelves as well.  I did not know what to do, I was completely clueless and I had no book to write my report over.  So eventually the teacher had to change the report topic because not on student was able to find @PERSON1.  But if the state had not allowed these books to be taken off of the shelves then we would not have had this problem.     Another example was when my friend @PERSON2 wanted to learn about his culture and where his ancestors came from.  But when he got to the library he could not find any books over the arabic world.  So he asked the librarian 'where are all the books covering @LOCATION3, @LOCATION2, and @LOCATION1?'  And the librarian said that they were all removed because after @NUM2 @CAPS1 saw arabs as very offensive people and that no books were left unchecked.  I'm sure that he found this comment to be very offensive but there was nothing that he could do about it because the white people found arabs to be offensive and unequal to the white race.     These are only a few things that have already happened becaue of people finding certain books to be offensive, which is why I believe that the government should leave all the books on the shelves and let the people decide to pick up that book or pass it by.  Sure people have a freedom of speech but it should not effect what books belong on the shelf.  Which is why I believe that censorship should not be allowed to effect libraries of the public.",4,4
3678,"No, I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music , movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the selves if they are found offensive. Here are statements on why i believe this.          First, I think if you are reading, listening, or watching any of these things then dont read the part that is offensive to you. If you believe that it is offensive to you then why are you reading it? If you believe this is offending you then put it down and forget about it, you dont have to read or watch it. I think if you are reading or watching it, then it is at your own fault if you are offended by it.         When does anyone even write about offending things lately anyway? Like I said before if you are reading or watching or whatever it is then it is your own fault, @CAPS1 states that when one of you states you have been offended you just get rid of that thing and tear it away from our lives.Well it stops today I am writing today to stop the people who are ruining other peoples lives by getting rid of what other people like to do.           If you believe that you should take away our fun and pleasure of doing these things, then do it, but remember of what your taking away from those who like to read all of that.If you get rid of the books that keep us entertained then there will be nothing left on the shelves for any of us.          I have written in this newspaper of things that should be left alone.I have also written about if you do take away our simple things we like to read, just think about your taking away from those who read, listen or watch these things. Take in order of what I have said, goodnight.",4,3
4426,"There are things in the world that are not ment for certain people to see. Things like rated @CAPS1 movies, @CAPS2 books, alcohol, and @CAPS2 music are not ment for children. Yes people have rights, they can view whatever they want. If a @CAPS4 wants to see a rated @CAPS1 movie or drink a beer that is the parents choice to let that @CAPS4 see that movie not the person running the store. If you are under the age limit a store keeper should have the right to tell you, you can't go in the store or buy his product.           Is it okay for a storkeeper to to tell your @CAPS4 no? Some would say yes to this and others would say no. If your @CAPS4 is trying to buy a movie with guns, blood, and killing, and you don't want your @CAPS4 to have this movie you might be mad if a store keeper let your @CAPS4 buy it. On the other hand you might be mad if this store keeper told your @CAPS4 he wasnt allowed to buy this movie. If the rated @CAPS1 is based on maturaty how does this store keeper know how mature your @CAPS4 really is? Your @CAPS4 could be a one that likes to copy the things they see on movies, the store keeper doesn't know if this is true or not. He doesn't know this @CAPS4, he can't say if he is mature enough to watch this movie with guns, blood, and killing. How would this store keeper feel if this @CAPS4 watched this movie he let the @CAPS4 buy and the @CAPS4 went out and killed someone, how would you feel if this happened? This wouldn't happen if there was an age limit.     If a group of @NUM1 year olds who just got their license go into a liquor store and try to buy beer, who is going to stop them from drinking and driving if there is no age limit on drinking? Lives get wasted when teenagers make choices like drinking and driving. When your @NUM2 years old you don't think about whats going to happen after you make a choice, you just think about how fun it's going to be while your doing it. Most 12-@NUM2 year olds aren't mature enough to make decisions in the spure of the moment.      There for there should be an age limit for some things, maybe not all things in the world, like weather or not your @CAPS4 can buy a candy bar or a soda. But an age limit on buying an @CAPS1 rated movie, alcohol, guns, knives exc. What would the world be like if children went around with these things? With an age limit on ceritain this there wouldn't be a probelm with these things",3,3
3877,"Censorship has become a major topic when it comes to books, music, and movies.  These are being censored because people don't want young kids to read, listen, or watch these materials.  What about the adults?  Books, music, and movies being taken off of the shelfs in libraries because of censorship, is not fair to the adults.     Books now are being rewriten so they won't have offevsive language in them.  To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a classic example of this.  Changing the offensive language in this book would totally ruin it.  This book is mainly about the racism that whites had towards the african americans, and if that was altered the readers wouldn't get a sense of that racism.  If libraries have books that are censored they should put them on a shelf just for censored books so adults could still be able to read them.     Music is another peice of material that censorship has gotten a hold of.  Offensive language is being taken out  of songs and uncensored cd's are not being sold in some stores because of censorship.  Some adults like the original songs with the original words.  Libraries should carry both the explicit and the clean verions of cd's to they some them that are suitable for kids and the ones that adults can listen to.     Movies are another peice of material that censorship has taken over.  They are being rated @CAPS3, suitable for all ages, @NUM1, suitable for children @NUM2 and older, and rated @CAPS4, suitable for people @NUM3 and older.  These rating are good guidelines, but parents should be the ones to make the final decision on whether or not their child should be able to watch a certain movie.  Libraries should have all kind of movies on their shelfs.  If a twelve year old kid wants to watch a @NUM1 or rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.     Censoship is a good thing but it doesn't need to be taken to the extreme.  If an adult wants to read a censored book, he or she should still be able to read it at their local libary and if a young kid wants to watch a rated @CAPS4 movie, he or she should be able to with the consint of a parent or guardian.",4,4
3073,"What are we hiding from? Is personal expression really that bad? Questions such as these come to mind when the topic of censorship in libraries arises. In my own personal opinion I believe forbidding works of art from libraries is the same as destroying the people @CAPS1 created them. Censorship in general is a way to hide reality and sugar coat the struggles within life itself. One can not learn unless given the oppurtunity to face the problems in society and the world. By banning certain pieces, the world destroys an opportunity to expand the knowledge of every individual.      With the removal of materials such as books and music, libraries ruin the time spent and heart that the creators have placed trustfully within them. Although most people use these materials strictly for entertainment, the writers and musicians created them for self expression and to show their pain and struggles. It could even be said that expression such as this is theraputic for these specific individuals. How would you react if your form of art was dibbed unsuitable for a public audience? Would you be hurt and taken back? Many artists probably feel that they are being placed in a state of seclusion and hatred. With the creation of art there is always a deeper meaning behind them. The biggest question in my eyes is, ' @CAPS1 deems that material as unsuitable for libraries'? What can be so wrong with specific material that we must take it away from everyone? At the pace our world is going today their will be no individualism left within the next fifty years. If people are not even allowed to listen to specific types of music, sooner or later people won't be able to wear certain types of clothes or even dye their hair a different color. The human population's greatest gift is their ability to be different. If our society cannot even handle freedom of expression through art, how can it handle any other type?     Libraries are created as a place to expand knowledge. If materials are censored how can anyone learn? Every individual has their own way of thinking and interpreting subjects. A book seen as entertainment and down-time reading to one person @MONTH1 be the very thing that strikes a world changing idea in the mind of another. A human's greatest idea comes strictly from the knowledge they have accumulated throughout their life time and off of their interests. If certain forms of art are censored individuals will never be able to find that form of interest in certain subjects. Everyone will strictly be forced to believe and learn the same things, restricting the world from the magical ideas one man could have formed with the information obtained from the art that had been censored. In a discussion based class I previously took, we read an article discussing the @ORGANIZATION1's decision to ban any information related to the loss of the @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and the terrible things their society had done in their attempt of complete succesion from the @LOCATION1. Through ideas such as this, you are not only taking knowledge, but also implanting lies into the heads of the next generation. In that specific situation in the @ORGANIZATION1 it created a hatred and false sense of the @CAPS4 in the childrens' eyes. How can one specifically influence the beliefs of a child @CAPS1 is only @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old based off of their personal selfish beliefs? Through censorship we are destroying the truth and knowledge that each individual deserves if they are determined to find it.      The biggest thing about censorship is the cover up of reality. Do libraries think if they do not publically display a controlversial topic no one will know about it? Knowledge is all around us. No one needs a book to tell you our world is not perfect. For all we know, a book censored could have saved millions of lives. I cannot fully grasp the concept in my head of hiding materials from the public. There will soon come a time where expression at all will be censored. If we are getting rid of art should we remove people too? I can relate censoring books to censoring people based on my own personal experience. A teacher once told me that I would not ever achieve my career, because I had piercings. Opinions such as these could kill a person's dreams. I have known that I wanted to be a lawyer since I was seven years old and have been working to better my education based on my goals. How can you tell someone that they are not good enough based on your specific beliefs? There will always be something in the world you do not like. Each library @MONTH1 decided to censor a different type of art from their individual location. Eventually the world will have no art left, because those few people chose that it was not suitable for everyone. I can almost guarentee that most individuals have lived through worse experiences than what are being covered up. The world cannot be sugar coated or portrayed as perfect, because that is not lfe. Everyone will struggle at some point and its works of art that really get us through it. Sometimes we relate to them or in my case art such as music is what makes me feel better when I am hurt. The pain will always be there. Going through reality and the struggles is what makes each individual @CAPS1 they are. Censorship in libraries will not hide anything from the public, it will just destroy an oppurtunity to grow.     Censorship in libraries is what will destroy our world. No individual can say that material is not suited for the public, because they are not the public. Every person poses their own opinions on life. By banning these works of art you are banning individuality as a whole. If things like this continue our planet will become mindless zombies will no personal opinions. Libraries will be taking knowledge from everyone and ruin the chances for greatness for many people. There is no true way to hide reality from the world. Let people display their feelings through their art and share it with the world. The struggles of one person @MONTH1 be what saves another and allows the ideals of the world as a whole to grow",4,5
3095,"yes because what if a @NUM1 year old could find a offensive to have a book that talks about his race in a bad way. Now if a man walks in and finds a offensive book about his race he @MONTH1 take the shitchuration to a new level like maby he @MONTH1 demand it to be taking off the shelf or somthing else. If a women walks in with her son or daughter and find a dirty nasty book about sex, drugs, guns and knifes.     So yes a offensive book should be taken off a shelf if the book or books are in a public libeary. Only reason the books should be taken off the shrelf is because if its a public libeary alot of kids and their pearents to read, do research and do homework.     And that is why a public libaery should take a offensive book off their shelf",2,3
3681,Books are books we all read them and summary's over them. To find what we need to know in the past or future or mainly whats going on todays life. So we shouldnt take books off the shelfs just like magizens. They might have information to tell people around the world. Thats why people make books and magizens so people like us can read them while were notbusy in life or just relaxin.      People read bad stuff all the time in books or magizens thats what life is about cause there's some good stuff and there are some bad stuff to read about in life. I mean hey if you dont want your children readin them than have them not read at all. Because more they age the more there going to know whats going on in life. There's stuff thats bad like you cant really stop them. When there at that age in there life so there going to find out some how or another. Cause there are schools that have alot of reading to talk about good stuff that might be important for there future's.Schools are mainly why kids know what they know now because you got all your history  clases. That talk about slavery and every thing els thats bad. When kids say it outta class rooms they get in trouble.      So if they get in trouble outta class then why do would you teach it or even say it. History classes are very helpfull because  they teach you about all the different wars. That has happend and who invaded other countrys or states. They help out on findin places on a maps. That shows all the wolds state and countrys and even where we live in our country.     So really why would u take stuff off the shelfs if other people read them. Mainly why would you do it since other people have worked very hard and there time makin books.  Then have them published for you to just take them off the shelf. What if they wanted to do that to you if you wrote maybe some bad stuff  in a little writing.  Whats the harm in it anyway,3,3
3480,"Is it understandable to have some books restricted to people because of their age?  No it is not the whole situation of wether or not libraries should have things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to certain people due to there age should not be an issue.  My reasoning on that is not because of how it @MONTH1 influence people in a bad way.  Then again it @MONTH1 influence them in a fantastic way.          Thats how people find out who they are such as, what their interested in, what they like, and what they want to do.  If it wasnt for establishments such as libraries most people would be the same as the others and not have a sense of character to themselves. People would be to similar and have little to no differences to themselves from others.  People should be aware of some of the content in books. Just not to the point were those areas become restricted to certain age groups.  Movies and cds are more understandable do to the actual graphic violence and language that some musicans and actors @MONTH1 use.  Except in a book its not what other people are doing and saying its what you yourself is reading and how you yourself is interperating it.  It takes more than what some people are doing and saying to reflect on what your reading and how your reading it.     Thats why the whole situation of wether or not libraries certain things such as movies, books, and cds restricted to a certain age group, but instead having the ares labeled on what the category is to know before looking.  So therefor that is my views and beleifs on why or why not libraries should be restricted to certain people.",3,3
4301,"I believe that if some people don't like a certain book or movie then they should be able to tell the library about that itme and it should be removed from the library. The library should allow people who use the library to take away things that are offensive to its customers.     Some parents who come into a library with their children let their children go off and look at books by themselves which is what my @CAPS1 used to let me do when I was a kid. If children are by themselves with no adult supervision and wander into an adult reading section they could look at something bad. They could also buy a magazine that looks perfectly fine on the outside but have offensive images on the inside.      When I was ten years old, my family and I went on vacation to @LOCATION1. We were watching a baseball game that was on commercial break one night. We were fliping through the channels wating for the game to come on. We were all watching the television when an offensive image came on the televison that children's eyes shoudn't see. That occurance happened when I nor my parents wanted me to see it. That image was an adult image and was meant for adults only, but childrens eyes can see it as well. Libraries should think of this when they are puting books and magazines on their shelves. They might be making a little bit of money but they are effecting a childs life in a negative way. Things like this could happen in a library also because children who are young won't always know what is a childs book and what is an adult magazine. Children also might ask their parents for music that the case of the music might look fine on the outside, but have cursing and bad things on the inside. This is the reason why all items in a library that are offensive to people should be removed from libraries.     If people who go to the library don't like something on the shelves they should be able to ask the library to take the item off the shelve. The libray might not do it everytime, but taking items off the shelves would make libraries more enjoyable and safe for children. If the library doesn't take the items off the shelve it could effect their business in a negative way. The library should only take off the items that regular visitors to the library ask for. The library shoudn't listen to someone who has visited the library only a few times. The library should listen to its customers that visit the library often.      I think that all offensive images to people that visit the library should be taken off the shelves and removed from the library. The library should listen to its customers not only because it could effect their business, but becasue it could effect the lives of children in a positive or negative way.",3,3
3310,"Cooling the @CAPS1: @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 From Book @PERSON1 _________     Censorship in public libraries would be an insult to the institution. A library, a citadel of knowledge, should not be bound by a society as to what knowledge it can convey. One point of a library, the destination of researchers, is to offer information that must be sought: for those who cannot find the information in their homes without fear, for those who cannot ask their questions without retribution, the library stands as a pillar of safety. Books are incapable of judgment.     To censor the books held in a library is to chip away at human progress. A freedom of thought and a freedom of press, present within our nation and increasing in presence around the @CAPS5, precludes the idea of this censorship.     If any book is subject to criticism or opposition, are not all books worthy of the same? To value one opinion or perspective less than another is to debase the entire culture from which libraries have arisen. Libraries are a communal institution, open to all views and writings. The point of bringing books together under one roof is to equate them, and give them all equal standing as literature or scholarly works.     From personal experience, censorship in the library has cost me precious time, and has stolen from me parts of my life. Growing up in a small town, where ideas of gender and sexuality were somewhat firmly set, any search for dissenting opinion was often fruitless. When I visited my school's library, as a child searching for answers about my sexuality, I found little aid. Around the library were a thousand stories of a man and woman falling in love, but never did I find a fairy tale of two princes. It was not until I left the school that I found that such books did exist in my old school library, but kept removed, off the shelves, restricted. More insulting than finding books of @CAPS4 issues completely unrepresented was to find that they were treated so separately.     Here lies the problem. Some people believe that if minority opinions or values are unrepresented, they will disappear. Such is the point of censorship: ignoring an issue or a life-choice to the point of extinction. But books cannot shout their values. They cannot shove information down our throats. Books must be read, we must give our consent to their knowledge. Unlike an advertisement that might accost us unawares, we must pick up a book and open it to receive its guidance.     If my library had done its job and given me the guidance I sought, I would have grown so much more easily. I would have learned not only how to express and accept myself, but I might have grown to more easily accept others as well.     In the past few years, with the effects of @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7 reaching the newest generation, @LOCATION1 has searched for ways to pay homage to the victims of the violence of @CAPS8 and of the @CAPS9. What the country finds, however, is that it cannot effectively memorialize the tragedies. In trying construct a monument, the government and culture find that they have little to build off of. The products of murder and book-burning have resulted in an emptiness, a void. As such, architects have created what @MONTH1 be called 'anti-monuments', commemorating a void to posterity to memorialize what was lost. One of the most powerful, to me at least, appears in the form of a negative bookshelf: a solid wall, with gaping holes in the form of book spines, ranging across the rows. Such is the knowledge lost from book-burning. We cannot even describe what is lost, for the knowledge has vanished. We must ask, what are we missing? What views, what prose, what beauty has been taking from us while we continue living, never having the chance to glimpse it?     This is the effect of library censorship. To remove a book from its natural and rightful place on a shelf is to set its words aflame. Once it is gone, it will be forgotten. To protect our posterity, to enlighten our descendants, we must work to preserve all books, any book that appears offensive, or disgusting, or brave, or new. Let the reader decide its value. Let the person in search of answers pick it up or leave it behind. Give the book a chance for it @MONTH1 have a power that is unrealized. Leave the libraries as they are, as the monuments to the preservation and progression of knowledge and wisdom.",6,6
3138,"In libraries, there should not be censorship on materials considering that it's an individual's decision to read what they prefer. There is no appropriate standard on what makes a book offensive to a group, so it should be undetermined as to what makes a book offensive.      In a public library, many children, who the books are censored for, are with their parents. Parents should make an independent choice on what they can allow their children to read. Letting society ban a book simply for the use of inappropriate materials is ridiculous. If an author spent time creating a story, it should be appreciated, and should not put on a list of no-nos. If a certain person doesn't like a book's reputation, all they have to do is not read it. Even in school systems, librarians are there to guide kids to read good books. If a child wants to read an inappropriate book, the librarian will most likely discourage him or her not to read it.     In my experience, I wanted to read a book that my mother suggested to me, but as I went to the school library it turned out to be a censored book. Some parents believe children should be ignorant about offensive things written in books, but honestly many of the same ideas are exploited to them everyday on television and internet. So trying to shield your child from the bad things @MONTH1 be a great thing, but the efforts are usually failed attempts. It also never occurs to the people censoring the books, that some people can't afford to buy the books they want to read. The libraries, for some, are the main means for getting books.     To conclude there is very little reason to ban a book from the shelves. Many of the books banned have important lessons that can be obtained through reading it. If a person doesn't like a book, the simplest thing to do is not to pick it up.",4,4
4201,"Libraries hold more than just books, magazines, and movies... They hold history. With out any doubt, there is offensive material printed on numerous pages spread through out the thousands of books and magazines a library holds. Some find this terrible, but I on the other hand, completly disagree. Every book has a different story to tell, and everyone comprehends the content differently so I think libraries shouldn't take out offensive material from their shelves.      What's really considered offensive? This question would be very hard to answer because everyone has a different veiw, different opinons, and a different background. Some would say violence, drugs, gangs, and sexual situations are offensive... While others consider religion, beliefs, traditions, and morals offensive. With all the different veiws on what someone finds offensive, a library would have to almost completly clean their shelves just to remove a small porportion of it.      There's many sections in a library, from fiction to children stories. If there is an area for 'children books,' and 'adult books,' @CAPS1 can't there be one for materials some readers would find offensive? Libraries could even mark a book if it held something offensive.This would settle many conflicts! If a reader chooses to read a book that was marked with offensive content, they would have no right to get upset.       Limiting our libraries shelves is unthinkable. If someone got offended by what they read, they could put the book down just as fast as they picked it up. A public library is a public place, where many people go... so if one person gets offended by something they read or saw, doesn't mean the next person will. Bottom line is, no book should be taking away because someone couldn't handle what was being sad.     'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf - that work I abhor - then you have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS2 everyone's veiw on offensive material is different, eliminating it would be hard. One person found this book offensive, so it's gone... The library would be pointless. The shelves would empty, because the loss of many phenomenal books. People do get offended, that's just life... I don't think that they should be able to take a book away from everyone just because of one person's opinon on it",4,4
4734,"Todays world is filled with rasicm and critisim. Anything we do is either right or wrong, no inbetween. Whenever your out to eat, or shopping you can hear offensive comments or images all around you.  The newspaper, news, and internet make events appear worse than what it is, if it refers to certain people they take it offensive.     If you go out looking for a good book to read, or a movie to watch, or music to listen to laying in bed, you pick what interests you. When your looking through the selection you're going to see and reconize titles, or pictures that offend you. I know when I do I pick the object up and look and see what it says on the back.     In someway, someone, is going to find a movie, music, books, or magazine offensive. Say we take everything off the shelves off every store that is offensive in any way to people. What would be on the shelves? Nothing, @CAPS1 have to right to write about anything they want, singers have the right to sing about what they want.     In the @ORGANIZATION1 every single person has the freedom of speech. So libraries can't take something off the shelves just because someone @NUM1 it offensive. That's the point of the different genres of music and reading, so you can read and listen to what you want.     Every @CAPS2 has the choice of what they pick up and listen to or read. If someone finds something offensive, then they shouldn't pick the object up. Then, when that person complains about it, the bottom line is that it's their fault for reading it.     There's going to be offensive things said about race, culture, looks, and weight. That's just apart of life and how people act anymore. There;'s just a point when you have to be the bigger person and ignore it and move on.     So, no I do not believe that offensive books, music, or magazines shoulkd be removed from libraries or stores. We have the choice to pick what we read and listen to.",3,3
3508,"In today's society it is easy to find small things that offend people wether it is politics or religion. The truth is no one is able to keep everyone happy. A major debate of today would be that of the media. Should people have the right to remove books, music, movies, or magazines from our shelves because they are found offensive to one person? The answer is no. Three important reasons support this answer: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and knowing everyone can find something that is offensive.     When @LOCATION1 was finally free from @CAPS1 a main goal was to have our freedom of speech. This was a huge achievement for the @ORGANIZATION1. Allowing people to remove matieral from our shelves would be breaking the one rule we worked so hard to gain. People today rely on being able to speak their minds to be apart of their government.     Another law that @CAPS2's appriecate is, freedom of the press. Being allowed to write how they feel is what @LOCATION1 is practically based on. With out this wouldn't we be back into the old ways that @CAPS3 fought to change? This is a question you must think about when making this important decision.     Finally a huge impact on this decision is knowing that everyone has an opinion on something. It is easy to find someone that is offened by the smallest of things. What happens when someone decideds to find the @CAPS4 offensive to their religion? Do we take it off the shelve and tell the @CAPS5 sorry? If we decided to allow this would there even be books, movies, music, or even magazines for us?      It is easy to assume just to take a book off the shelve because it's offensive to you, but what happens when we allow this to everyone? That is why when coming to a decision on how we should handle this, it is going to take much more thinking than a couple of days. We must remember though the rights we are given as @CAPS3; the freedom of speech and the freedom of the press, and we must always think about how this is going to effect our later generations.",3,4
3896,"What is censorship? Censorship is editing or just plain getting rid of.  Censorship can be a good thing it could also be a bad thing.  Does censorship really help in our society?  Actually think about it, there is still murders, rapes, and whatever else with censory.  How I would argue with this, is by listing my own experiences, observations, and readings.     Firstly, my experiences would have to be about movies and/or television shows.  In some movies you get to choose on what you want to watch. The unrated version or the censored version.  Well, most people want to watch the unrated version, beacuse it's more than likely more funny and shows more.  Other people might choose the censored version, because of the fact that they have children and dont want them watching stuff that would be in the unrated version.  I would perferably pick the unrated version, because i like all the funny parts that wouldn't show in the censored version.  Then there are those television shows that 'bleep' out alot of words, because of course you are not allowed to say them on television.  Parents dont want their six year old going around and saying all of them nasty words.  That's why most of the time you hardly ever see them kind of shows on in the afternoons, they are usually on at @TIME1 or later.     Secondly, my observations about movies and/or television shows.  I cant say that I dont watch shows that have some language in them nor can I say that I dont watch shows that are all bloody and gory.  I do watch them, but i would never watch them around my younger sister!  She is eleven years old, I dont want my littel sister going to school and saying a bad word and have a teacher hear her.  Then she would say well @PERSON1 was the one who watched the movie.  I would also never ever watch a bloody, gory, and really graphic movie in front of her either.  Some movies could do without so much violence, but they have to make money some how. Right?     Last but not least, my readings about, lets say books and/or music lyrics.  So many books have been banned across the @LOCATION1, because people were offended by them or just didnt want that book on the shelves just in case their child reads it.  Some songs cant be played on the radio, because of some of the stories behind the music and/or the words in and through out the song.  That's why the artist of the song has to make two different copies of their song, so they can be played and so they will get popular.  I have read books that do have some words in them, but they are also my grade level and I'm pretty sure most people are more mature than they were.  When I see a word that isn't the nicest word ever, I keep reading and dont let it bother me.  Same with songs, the artist probably has a reason why he/she uses the words they use.     Censorship can be good or bad, it really depends on how you look at things.  Honestly, I have no objections to censorship and other times I do.  My experiences, observations, and/or reading has made me think about how censorship could be bad or good.",4,4
4519,"@CAPS1          @CAPS1 a day where there are no books in the school library. A librarian walks through the now empty corridors, reminising of the days before censoring, before everyone told her of what they found offensive. Everyones ideas are different, but that absolutely does not mean they should have everyone else comply.      Saying such, if someone finds a book offensive, they just should not pick it up. Just don't read it! By pushing to have the book taken out, they would be implying that they know best, and usually, they don't know best. A @CAPS2 could be offended by a fashion magizine in the library @LOCATION1 simply has an advertiziment for a body wash. She @MONTH1 say something like '@CAPS3 child shouldn't see things like this,' then demand it be taken out of the library.      Does that make sense? I didn't think so either. In addition, if one woman was able to take a magazine out of the library, then another man or woman would believe they had the same power. Censoring could become a casual thing, and books could be thrown out daily! Now, that's only on a small scale. @CAPS1 if they actually took this up with higher authorities. That book would be taken away from all schools in the @LOCATION1 brings us to this problem. Should we, as people,as normal citizens, really decide what others are able to read? The answer to that is a definate no.      Let's look on the other end of this now, too. What will happen to the authors who wrote the books that are now banned? As an example, I'll use @PERSON1. What would happen to her if the series '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' were banned from schools? Also, what about the kids that like to read? This is just taking good books away from the students...Because someone didn't believe in magic and threw a fit about it.      That librarian from the beginning is leaving now, theres no more books to check out, bring back, or read anymore. The kids have to go to a public library to get all the books they want to read, and are then still discouraged from reading because the material wasn't proper. This shouldn't happen. Books do not need to be censored, and people who have a problem with a book just shouldn't ruin it for everybody",3,4
3447,"Throughout the world, there are thousands of people with various opinions. If one person thinks an art piece looks unique, another @MONTH1 not see any true beauty. But when people hardly underdstand the concept of other people, they should not be exposed to books or movies that could be defined as offensive. Some people don't know @CAPS2 it is like to be truely offended.       When I was in middle school, I was a shy, fragile, young girl. I had just moved to a new school and was petrified of my new surroundings. For the first couple of weeks, I felt like an outcast; like an outsider looking in. I didn't fit in with anyones' group. Everyone seemed to of already have friends for years and here I was, a new student with no friends to communicate with. I was isolated and was desperately trying to find someone to be my friend. I wondered if something was wrong with me; if I has a bad odor or was dressed in an out of style fashion. I tried buying new clothes and changing my hair color. It seemed as if I wasn't even noticed. Before I new it, school was half way over. I was still a nobody. Then @PERSON1 came along and made me a somebody.     @PERSON1, who had just moved to my school, looked bold and confident. At first, people waved a friendly hello but nothing more. As I sat at my empty lunch table, @PERSON1 approached me and asked to sit down. I couldn't refuse the offer so I nodded a sincere yes. The entire lunch period, we sat talking. We had a lot in common and I was glad to have made a friendship with @PERSON1. Months went by before I realized @PERSON1 and I were great friends. I knew I could trust him with all of my secrets. Even though @PERSON1 and I were close, I felt as though @CAPS3 was always hiding something. Occasionally I would have enough courage to ask if there was anything @CAPS3 needed to tell me, but as the same as every answer before, it was a no.      @PERSON1 and I had always walked to my house after school. But on one afternoon, something felt wrong. The air seemed to lingere for miles. We didn't talk until we got inside my house. Suddenly @PERSON1 spoke and said, '@CAPS1 are people so cruel?' I was shocked by this question for I didn't know how to respond. @PERSON1 sensed that I had no clue @CAPS2 @CAPS3 was talking about so @CAPS3 continued. 'I'm gay.' I was appalled. Not because @CAPS3 was gay, but because @CAPS3 had never told me. I asked, '@CAPS2 happened?' @CAPS3 sat on the couch then and told me about how @CAPS3 was in the library overhearing some of our classmates reading a book about people making fun of gays'. I felt awful for @PERSON1. It wasn't his fault @CAPS3 was gay.     I believe that certain books, movies, or music that are offensive to people should not be aloud on shelves. Some have never been offended. Some, always offend people for many reasons. Everyone has feelings and it hurts when they are offended. We, as a community, should love one another and respect them. Not read or listen to things that can hurt someones' inner feelings",4,3
3469,"Censorship in school libraries is important, but at the same time it is not necessary. I believe that many books in the school library are not apropriate for younger children, but these same books should not be taken out of our libraries becuase I feel like high schoolers are mature enough to be reading this material. The material in this books are no differnt than what goes on in the high school years.      Most of these books give a prospective on real life stories and @MONTH1 be able to help someone cope and realize that they are not alone. At the same time though many of these books do contain curse words, some sexual scenes, partying, drinking, and doing drugs. These books are too old for a elementary school age child and maybe even a middle school age child to be reading. For example the books by @PERSON1, these books are about a girl who becomes addicted to drugs, pregant, in jail, and homeless. I read these books, they are really good books, and they showed me how by just trying one drug, one time, could ruin your whole life. I learned a lot from these books, but I don't think that anyone younger than fourteen should be reading them.       There should be a limit on the censorship. Many things talked about in the books, are the same things talked about in the school hallways, what is the difference? That is why authors write about the things they do, so they can conect with teenagers. Many books are an authors experience, so they are meant for high school age. Many authors will put an age level on their books, like fourteen and older. Librabries should pay attention to these ratings before putting the books in the libraries.      Someone @MONTH1 become offened by what they read in a book, but I don't think that book should be taken off the shelf becuase of one person. If it becomes a bigger issue, than yes it should be taken off, but at the same time, that one book @MONTH1 be someone else's way from escaping the hardships in their life.     Many adults would disagree with my statements becuase they feel like if a teenager is reading about someone drinking, do drugs, or having sex, then they are more likely to do those things. I feel like this is not true becuase the book I am reading now, they are partying and drinking, but I'm not out doing that. What is the differnce between someone reading it in a book and seeing it on television? I see many worse things on the @LOCATION1 than I read in books. Parents should be happy that their teenager is reading and not playing video games or out with friends.     These are just my oppinons, some people @MONTH1 agree with me and others @MONTH1 disagree, but I am going to stick with my oppinons",4,4
3859,"I do not feel these types of things should not be taken off the shelves.What i think is that thing should come with a rateing because  this is a free country and for some one to do something like that it would be takeing away someone's freedom of speach.To many people have faught in the past for just simply freedom of speach.I think that if people rate the  thing's  that come out then they will not go in to the wrong hands. That's like saying they should have taken @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 when it first came out off the market because it has violance in it ,profange language,and guns that company will had lost a lot of money because it is inapprotive for kids.I think that parent's shouldn't go buy a @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old something like that but some parents do .It not the creaters fault of the actions of how people react to what ever is put out there because the buyers have to be more responseable and make sure that what ever it is is supervised and carefully montoired. There's an old saying ' every thing isn't made for every body' .I strongly belive that;That saying is so true .Every body don't like the same thing that some one eles likes but its okay for that person but it's not okay for you because as they say everything isn't for every body and you can't fource nothing on some one.Well every thing isn't approtive  for every one we all have are limites to every thing and if you watch what kids watch and do than things want be so inapprotive for this wold . Certion books young children should not read because they have sex in them and they talk about things that a child should not even be thinking about at that age.When children read books like that they tend to think about sex and how what they read about will feel but children should not be thinking about that type of stuff that why its there parent's responseabitly to montoir what there children read because that there job as parent's to do not the person who wrote the book because they @MONTH1 think there writing to a much older group that can relate to what there talking about but then again there just speacking there mind and infourceing there freedom of speach right one of the rights that we as a people together have been fighting for .I also feel that music help's us to express are selfs so if someone feels that the music is inapprotive for there child then they need to watch what there child is listen to.Music brings out the different moods in every body.All magazines are not for every one because as we all know there are adult magazines the produce certion imagary that children should not see but you can not blame the creater only the buyer is in fault for leaving it in the wrong place after there done with it .There just people trying to make money  off things that they know that people like.",3,2
4403,"What would you do if a woman walked into a library and started throwing a tantraum about how inappropriate a book was, and she wanted it removed from the shelves? Would you just stare and wonder if she was crazy? Would you think that this is a public place, and everyone has their own opinions? I believe that even if someone thinks a material in a library is inappropriate, the material should not be taken off shelves.     Many people actually believe materials in a library are too offensive or inappropriate. Unsurprisingly, libraries can't exactly do much about that except remove them from the shelves if absolutely nessessary. However, when you think about it, if everyone complained about a certain book being offensive, there would eventually be no more books! For example, I would not want my little brother reading @PERSON1 books because some chapters @MONTH1 contain a sex scene. However, my brother will eventually be older, and he'll be able to understand. If I would have gotten rid of that book, I wouldn't be letting other people enjoy it.     If you were to get books removed that were about @CAPS1 because you were @CAPS2, many @CAPS3 wouldn't be happy to say the least. This could be about any subject matter, however. The more books that are removed from the library, the less people will know about the subject. Eventually, as I've said before, there will be no more books left! Everyone has their own opinion of what is appropriate or not, and everyone's views are different.     The solution to this problem is simply to not remove the books. Sure, you might get complaints. But odds are, more people are unoffended rather than offended. Americans do have the right to fight for this, but with the majority being unoffended, it's a tough case to win.     I believe all books would be fine left on shelves. If you take off one book, you might as well take off the rest. Next time you are picking out a book, and you find it offensive, think about how other people might want to read it. They might even need the information for a paper they're writing for a class. You never know who might need the information. Don't be selfish; keep the books on the library shelf.",4,4
3928,"Some books on the shelf at libraries have bad things in it, whether it is what the book is about, the curse words in them, or just not very aproprit for some of the age groups. Should the books at the libraries be censored or should we just leave them for the reader to decide if they want to read it or not?     I dont think any of the books, or magazines should be censered. If some one wants to read a book with curse words in it or anything like that then let them. The parents @MONTH1 not let some kids read them but some parents just dont care. I think if they read them they might say them but they will learn not to say them and that they are not very nice to say.       Should the movies you get at libraries be censered? I dont think they should because the parents arent going to let them get it or watch the movie if they dont think it is something they need to be watching. The kids know what they can and cant watch so if it is something they know they cant watch then they shouldnt get it. The kids might get it but the parents could take it away and tell them they cant watch it.      Should all books.magazines, music, or movies from libraries be censered? No. If it is a library at school everything has to be school approprit. If the book, movie, magazine, or music is not approprit they the school cant lone it out. A public library can but there are mostly adults there. The kids should know what they can and cant watch, read, or listen to, so they should know better than to get something they cant read, watch, listen to, or look at. Some parents @MONTH1 agree to censering them but if you do that you are limiting the books everyone can read. Even the parents or adults wouldnt be able to read them aswell",3,3
4714,"I think that some books in the library some people might take offensive. But some of those books have a meaning behind it.            I think theres one book out there that alot of people love to read, and that is @CAPS1 @CAPS2. The book uses the '@CAPS3' word alot and many people take that offensive, but why? There was a big arguement about alot of book companies changing the word in the book to @CAPS4 @CAPS5.             From my perspective I think it should stay the same. Why change that now? Many english teachers use that book because it talks about a white boy named @CAPS6 saving @PERSON1. Its not being used in a bad why at all just using the terms of how they did back in the olden days. The book is strong and shows readers a strong aspect in life.             Yes you shouldn't go around saying that word, but also not change it now, after its been out for along time to the public. The book would not bring the same meaning as it would if it is  being changed",3,3

If some one don't like this book and this book offended them.They shold don't read this book and read what they like. but son't say should be removed this book. I think evey one like different books.

4619,"Materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive! It's a public library. Not many people would like to find something that seems to hurt or harm them in any way.      Libraries are for people to come in and should be expected to enjoy something, whether it be a book, movie or magazine. When people come in looking for some good information about something, they look forward to finding good tips, and not being let down. Example, with something possibly about someone being racist. That's dissapointment to some. Noone should have to walk in and find something that offenses them. It's not fair.     Now, to parents with children. Would you like for your child going into a library that is allowed to look wherever their little heart desires, and they come upon porn or just anything that would be a bad influence on them? I highly doubt it. Unless, you just don't care about what your kid reads these days, but to the ones who want their child having a good education, well, you understand my statement.     It's just not fair to the ones who go to a library expected to be satisfied, but instead are let down. It does them no good, and it could make your community look bad. Libraries are to help people with information, fun facts, and all around good resources. So, please put the bad books, music, magazines, etc. away!",3,3
4719,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf-- that work I abhor--then you also have exactly yhe same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' states Katherine Paterson. Books and movies all over the world are being censored and removed from libraries, day after day, due to their explicit content. I believe that books, movies, and magazines should not be removed from the shelf, and that they are there for a genuine purpose. Explicit objects should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, children's parents have a right to exclude the material from the child's life, and some material can be useful in life and someone @MONTH1 learn from @CAPS3.      Children everywhere are being influenced by books, magazines, movies, and even songs. Some people argue that these harmful materials are affecting how kids behave and act. I, however, believe that a child should have superb morals and values to know right from wrong. For example, if a child happens to see a pornography magazine lingering on a shelf of their local grocerey store, they should know that no matter how temping @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, that buying that pornography magazine would be wrong. From birth, parents are constantly teaching their children what is right and what is wrong. They attempt to teach their children the basics: that drugs, alcohol, and smoking will corrupt their health. @CAPS3 doesn't matter if a child sees someone doing drugs in a movie or hears a song about a teenager getting drunk. They should not be influenced by this because by using their logic, they should infer that what is being read or listened to isn't always the right thing to do.     Everyday, children's parents have the right to exclude harmful material from a child's life. After all, they are a superior figure in the child's life, and the child will always look up to them to lead the way. At most local theaters now, you have to be seventeen to see a rated '@CAPS1' movie. A lot of theaters allow a child to view a rated '@CAPS1' movie, no matter what age, as long as they have a parent or a gardian present. Movie theaters feel that by having a child's parent there would help immensly because the parent is choosing for their child to watch that particular movie, instead of the child viewing the movie without their permission. If a parent doesn't want their child to view a raunchy movie, they can simple say, 'NO!' @CAPS3's as simple as that. If a parent feels that a movie is decent for a child to watch, then go ahead and let them watch that material. Parental agreement should always be a main factor in determined whether or not a child could view a particular movie or read a certain provacative book.      If all offensive books and movies were removed from the shelf, we would be living in a structured world where no one would learn any more than what they already knew. Life @MONTH1 possibly become rather boring. Although, some people @MONTH1 find books and songs to be offensive, others @MONTH1 contribute from these materials. A child @MONTH1 pick up a book, start reading, and discover some disturbing thoughts that they never would have encountered beyond picking up that book. They would never of learned such things. Reading information like this, creates a move advanced society. Adults and children are becoming smarter each day. Any parent would agree that they would love any opprotunity to arise for their children to become smarter and more wiser than they already were. Songs, movies, books, and magazines could provide that for their child. Reading is an escape from a jungle of wild monkies for some children. They @MONTH1 use a book to get away from the struggles of everyday life and get lost within its lively pages. If more and more books are being censored and thrown out, that equates to less books a child could have an opprotunity to discover. I once read that even @CAPS4 classes all over the world are not allowing their students to read The @CAPS5 of @CAPS6 @CAPS7. The teachers find this book to be too inappropriate for their students. This is unfair for any student, because this novel is inspiring and life changing, so they are definitely missing out. Also, movies and songs are provided for one's pure entertainment, so @CAPS3 shouldn't always matter if its crude. A child or young adult @MONTH1 learn things that they never thought imaginable through provided public materials.     In conclusion, books, magaizines, movies, and music are one's individual way of expressing themself. They should not be censored because a human being should have a judgement of their own, parents have the right to exclude offensive material from a child's life, and material, not matter how crude @CAPS3 @MONTH1 be, can be used as a learning tool. If more and more material is being removed from our local libraries, @CAPS3's almost like authors are being punished for being unique. Our children won't be exposed to as much, therefore, they won't learn and grow from @CAPS3. Do you really want our society to prohibit intelectual thinking just because they think certain material @MONTH1 be offensive? Think about @CAPS3",5,5
3181,"The diversity of the world makes it rather difficult to please every person all of the time. What I find appropreate, another @MONTH1 find obscene and volgur. What I enjoy to read, or listen to, or watch, or any other manner of media consumption I indulge in, @MONTH1 insult or bother someone else; as a matter of fact it probably does. That still does not make it right to remove what I, or others like because it offends another person.     A child walks through a grocery store, doesn't get what they want and proceeds to drop the f-bomb. More than half the time, they heard that language from their parents. If not their parents, then the media right? Maybe so, but that media shouldn't be hidden for the 'just-in-case' a child hears it. If a parent or guardian does not want their child to hear such things, they shouldn't allow them to listen to it. They control what does and does not enter their house.      To remove such things from the library, would be like trying to keep a child from ever seeing a naked body, or hearing a curse word. Every time they bathe they'd need blinders from themselves and they'd never be able to leave their house, because people do not always watch what they say in public.      No, I do not feel like every type of movie, or book, etc., belongs in the library. There is a cut-off as to how inapropreate or volgure something should be and still be allowed in a public library. Novels that are so descriptive that the reader can almost see every aspect of the procreation taking place between the pages, should have its own place, seperate from the public library, right along with the movies that really do show every aspect.     Although I like the thought, to actually remove said books would be unfair. To deny access to those who find those books fine for themselves wouyld be wrong. A wise author, Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' The truth of this statement would not be hard to prove.      A religious family that believes @PERSON2, a book I find to be innocent fantasy, is a book series promoting witchcraft and satanism, so they remove them from the library. I remove the previously stated graphic romance novels. A mother whom wants her child to be sheltered from what she considers the filth of the planet, removes books of drug addicts, and abuse, and books of war because they're full of death. And as this continues, finally, we are left with the empty shelfs of a forgotten building that no longer has a purpose.      The graphic novels I find inapropreate could be placed in an adult section, or higher up than most children can reach. The protective parents can deny their own children the media they deem inappropreate, instead of the world.     Although not everything is appropreate for everyone, it isn't right to censor something from the world. There are ways to cencor things to parts and not others. Nothing should be romoved from the library because of its content. At most it should be placed in a less accessable manner.",4,4
4189,"Offensive metaerial like that should most definately be removed from the shelf. What if a child finds it? They @MONTH1 think its the coolest thing they've every seen. Children shouldnt be able to access this kind of material at all, especially from a place like a library.     Sombody could easily pick it off the shelf not knowing what it is. They @MONTH1 start reading it and not know what they're getting into, but it would be there fault for picking it off the shelves. This kind of material should only be places it is welcome, not in librarys or public places like that. If the material was at a type of book store that was not meant for people under @NUM1 to go to, then yeah it is meant to be on the shelf because children aern't aloud in that building, therefore they cannot see it unless it was brought out of the store to a household or somthing.     Depending on where you go, if that meterial is on the shelf, say at a place that is not so public, and you pick it up and start reading or watching it, you have yourself to blame for not researching the book or case of the material. If people want to get it they can, but it would be at there own risk. There for if the consumer takes it off the shelf, its there risk of being offended. There for they cannot blame the place the material was at.",3,3
4180,"I believe that many books in our local libraries @MONTH1 come off as crude or offensive to many readers, but I also believe it has a lot to do with the maturity level of some people. For instance, if you are an adult you will most likely be looking in the adult section. There @MONTH1 be children who look through that same section, although their parents should be monitoring what they are checking out at their local libraries.              Although maturity has a lot to do with it, some young adult books probably aren't intended for the people reading them. Some young adult books @MONTH1 be venturing too far, and the children who are reading these books probably shouldn't be. I don't think that everyone should have access to check out whatever they want whenever they want. Many parents have different rules for their children then others, and they @MONTH1 not agree with what is displayed among these shelves for their child to checkout. I remember times when I was a little my parents didn't always let me check out what I wanted, because I was too young to be viewing it in the first place          As for adults, they are free to make their own choices on what to checkout. I don't think the adult section at the libraries should be monitored all that much, because as an adult you are free to make your own decisions. You know whats right and whats wrong, and no one person should have to tell you what you should or shouldn't be reading.     The area that I would be most concerned with would be the young adult section. At that point children are at an awkward growing stage were they themselves are still learning whats right and wrong. Some books or movies could effect the young viewers dramatically. Their parents @MONTH1 be letting them watch horrific movies, and it could make them feel as if what they're watching is really okay. I think parents should be very involved in their children's lives, and closely monitor what their children are reading or watching.     I do feel that some books should be monitored, and taken off the shelves if they are found inappropriate for the intended age. Mostly in the children and young adult sections, because they could be taking in information they shouldn't be. I also feel that parents should take a part in their childs life, and set limits to what their child is aloud viewing. Above all, I think that everyone should check out books in their appropriate age section",4,4
4186,"I am writing you today to propose an explanation on my views of censorship in libraries. I recently had visited a library and some of the things I read in my time being there was really overwhelming.I think it should be censored and taking off the shelf. If you are a place of business you should not want things like that on your shelf. You should not want costumers reading it and feeling disgusted. I hope something I write will propose my reasons.              I have plenty of reasons to censor things and have them taking off the shelves that are offensive to me and others who visit the library, but only speaking on my behalf there were certain materials such as books, music, magazines, etc., that was offensive. I believe things in the nature should be handled in great authority. If anything I am trying to help me and my fellow citizens.              Just think if a visitor come in and pick up a magazine and it has insulting visual details of something that the reader can relate to or have experienced, and it is getting talked down about instead of beeing looked at, then they would be very offened. For them to come there it had to be a reson that they came, I know it wasn't so they would feel insulted. It is very inappropiate to have things that are offensive in the library.                It is plenty of different reason people come to libraries. Some come to get away, and to others its a daily routine. Whatever the case maybe they should feel comfortable in the place they are at. Why would you want people in the community or people period to not be comfortable where they are at. Just think if they are uncomfortable, then they are going to tell others and you will loose alot of fellow friends and alot of business. Think strongly on the things you do and the way you approach things to get peoples attention.                          To answer the question @CAPS1, I agree strongly on getting the offensive materials moved from the shelves. I believe in making people happy and one thing that is wrong with society today is too much judging and talking down and talking bad about people. If people would not judge or insult people then the world would be alot safer. It has to start somewhere, every little start causes for a great ending. I think this would be a good start on making the world happier and bringing all of us closer together. I hope something I wrote will help you on your descision",3,2
4722,"In our socioty, a lot of people and places take offense to certain things. In my opinion, librarys and book stores should not remove things from their shelves becuase they could be offensive.     People have the right to pick something up, over look it, and decide wheither it's offensive or not. If a book or movie that someone wrote or directed could get to them bad enough for them to freak out and complain to places that are selling it, then that book or movie probably shouldnt have been made.     I agree, somethings are offensive, but if someone you dont know wrote it or directed it, then dont let it bother you. I believe that music is a way that people express themselves. I honestly don't think that music should be censored when it's sold in any store. If the material is to graphic for children or some people, then don't listen to it. If you need things to be censored because of words or topics just so you can read, listen, or watch them, then maybe you just should do it.",2,2
3804,"In my personal opinion, I do believe that certain materials whether it be in books, music, magazines, or movies be romoved or edited more carefully. Most parents, including mine, expect their kids to behave with manners and not use foul language or make out with their boyfriend or girlfriend in inappropriate times, and yet we promote it and that's unacceptable.      In bookstores or even libraries, they have some books on the shelves that can be considered inappropriate. We encourage and even push kids to read, but we can't even say, pick any book you want. These books @MONTH1 have foul language, gang violence, or even sexual jestures that I wouldn't even consider giving to a niece or a baby cousin.      There are many types of music out in the real world. Everyone has their favorite music and they have their least favorite. In my opinion, you can't make everyone happy so your just going to have to ignore it. There are different cd's, cassate tapes, or even records, that you can buy. Yes, I think what some people put in their music is not appropriate but we can always change the station on the radio. You don't have to purchase that cd, and you can always ride with no music on.      Magazines can get pretty ugly sometimes. Whether it's @PERSON1 on the front page with no hair, or @LOCATION1's next top model. Quite frankly, I don't mind seeing that in magazines but strict parents @MONTH1 not want their kids being exposed to @NUM1 actions. Magazines could talk about anything such as someone on drugs, alcohol, or winning the lottory. You just have to choose what you and your kids look at wisely.      People can get pretty crazy on what they do and how they do it. Whether it be in writing, singing, or pictures, you know there is always someone going to do something inappropriate. This is reality and there is nothing that we can do about it. If you don't want to hear it, don't listen. If you dont want to see it, don't buy it. Its quite simple",4,4
4151,"Do you believe that certain materials, such as books, music,movies,magazines, should be removed from from shelves if they are found offensive. No i dont believe that certain materials should be removed if found offensive. Many kids today are into gang realted activites because they see parents,older siblings, or even friends into so they decide to do the same because they feel its cool.    Teens now days really dont care the movies, or the music. Not all music or movies are offensive. So we cant blame that. We can only blame ourselves for allowing our children to watch @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies listen to uncut music. We choose that life style for our children so we cant really blame the music and the movies. The people who make their uncut music or @CAPS1 @CAPS2 movies dont care who watches it or what affects it would have on children and neither does the parents. They're just trying to make a living like everyone else.      If parents can change they way they raise there children i think the world would be a better place. Just because some say that offensive movies, music or even magazines should be removed doesnt mean its there fault. Its the parents chose to say its okay if they child should listen to or watch offensive music and movies",3,3
4048,"The topic of library censoring has been increasing over the past few years. It has been discussed by many people, but a decision has never been reached. I say that there should be no library censoring. I would not have found my love for reading if libraries were censored like they are.     I think that there should be no censoring of libraries. It would impair our basic rights. Such as our right to freedom of expression. And our right freedom to the press.We would no longer live in a free country but a totalterrian state.     Though if they would put an age restriction on certian things that @MONTH1 please the debators. I think that many would agree to this if it was proposed . Thus, if we did this children would only be able to read or listen to materials apporiate for their age.     Though it is the parents who should censor what the children read and listen to not the libraries. It's the parents who introducee the children to music, magazines, and books. If the parents started to censor these materials early on this debate would not be going on as it is.     The topic of library censoring has been discussed and debated at increasing rates over that past years. Some want to censor our libraries though that is not the best choice. @PERSON1 said 'that if we have the right to censor libraries then thier will be no more books for any of us.",3,3
3544,"There are some movies,books,music,etc that @MONTH1 be found  offensive toward some people.I feel that if you are at the          appropriate age for a type of literature you should be able to observe it.If you read a book and you find it offensive,then      you shouldn't have read the book.Books,music,and movies are made to entertain you,however,if you are not entertained then what you're reading or watching is not for you!  I have had an experience in which I was offended by a movie I watched.It degraded women in which they were beaten and were treated as slaves.I was offended because as I watched the movie,and I realized that these women were someone's daughter and mother.I wouldn't agree with my mother being treated that way,also I wouldn't want any other woman being treated that way either.After I watched the movie,I went and informed my mother on how that movie offended me.I am sure that the authors who write the books intentions aren't to offend the reader,however,there @MONTH1 be a way that they can restate things that they say.I know that people have their own opinion,and that people think differently.If it is obvious that the reader's intentions are to offend the reader then you shouldn't purchase a book like that.If you find a book on the shelf,and you find it offensive,it shouldn't have to be removed from the shelf.Another person @MONTH1 read the book ,and they might like it.Everyone has their own way of thinking,and how they absorb information.It @MONTH1 be offensive to the reader,but someone else @MONTH1 recieve the book and admire it.  In conclusion,I feel that if you are offended by a certain book,type of music,or movie you should learn from the movie,and explain why it offended you.If a parent is offended they shouldn't allow their children to observe it as well.It will have a negative effect on your child.Books,music,movie,etc are made to entertain,not to offend.",4,4
3947,"Know you ask me to write an essay to a newspaper reflecting my views on censorship in libraries.  Well ok then I will you my not like what I have to say but I really dont care @CAPS1 if it was up to your dam goverment to decide what we could say or what we can read or even do. Theyd have us all in our house with our hands tied so we couldent learn more then how to eat, clean, and dress our selfs.      Now the way I see it is that we have every rite to read any book we please when we whant to read it. now if we dont want to read a book then we dont have to read it. but we as a people and they as a goverment do not have the rite to take your books out of the libraries. Now we as a people can press any thing we want @CAPS1 no matter what they as in the goverment thinks it is the people who run the stat not the dam goverment.     My point is, is that the books are there to teach us about our lives, our histoy. Books teach us about what wrong and what is rite. Books are here to give sceary story by a camp fire they are here to give kids a bed time story.  If we take thos books off our shelves you think the kids of your generation are bad just wait @CAPS1 the next one will be worse than this one i promise you that.      Now it is our rite to save our books, @CAPS1 if we do not then us as @CAPS3 will be lost. For without book our passed is lost, our fock tales are forgoten, our kids will not be able to sleep at night without there storys.      Now come guy as a all pull it together. If you see a book on the shevles and you think its offences then by @CAPS4 put the dam thing down and walk away from it dont complane about it. No one told you that you had to read it. So don't ruine it for everyone just @CAPS1 eather you dont belive in @CAPS4 and you think that the bibles not rite then dont touch. its the same way around if you do bleave in @CAPS4 and you think that all book that tell about a witch or vampires or that my even have a hore house in just leave it alone. its just a dam book let us read them. See you guy blame us kids that the vido games roten our minds but realy its the parent that dose @CAPS1 see there is nothing more a teenanger like myself loves to do more than to do something there mom or dad says not. So gut just back off and let us read and play and do what in the hell we want to do.",3,3
3298,"Many people base their actions on their own views. What @MONTH1 appear to be justified in their minds, due to their beliefs, might cause an uproar from others. One instance of this: media censorship. It happens every day, every place. Someone can take it upon them selves to ,in their mind, 'make the piece better for @CAPS8 viewing'. In reality, though, they are really ruining the experience of the media for everyone else and even impeading on the rights granted to us by the constitiution: @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2.                First up, books in the library. Everytime I go to the library and pick up some books, there is always one book with the 'bad parts' marked out. Someone had found these words offensive and decided that no one should have to see or read them. To me, it was irritating. I don't always like those words either, but having them marked out is distracting from the page and , for me, ruins the author's voice and style of writing, hence impairing what I draw from the book. Some marked-out words aren't always offensive to others, either. Simply put, if you find the book offensive, don't read it. Others @MONTH1 enjoy it, whether they share your views or @CAPS7.           People also take the liberty of simply removing whole pieces of media from shelves just because they find it offensive. If everyone removed anything they didn't like, or found offensive, there would be nothing left in the world for anyone to enjoy. We, as @LOCATION1 citizens, have the right to make our own choices, and our choices should @CAPS7 be limited by the views of certain individuals. That means that if I want to read or view something, it should be available to me, so I @MONTH1 learn and expand my views, even if it makes someone else uncomfortable.           With nearly every disputable form of media that comes out, people harangue the producers and say the piece should have never been made. Wrong. Producers and authors can publish whatever they would like. It's called @CAPS1 of the @CAPS2, and it is a right garunteed to us, as @CAPS5 citizens, under the @CAPS6. And learly, if pieces like that are being produced, people read it. Plain and simple. You might @CAPS7, but maybe a neighbor, or even a relative, @MONTH1 @CAPS7 be offended by it and might read it. Supply and demand. If everyone found it offensive, no one would buy or read it, and because of that, it would no longer be produced. You would get your way. But, no. Some people do read it and it is produced. Again, if you don't like it, don't read it.          People should @CAPS7 take it upon themselves to censor what others can and can't do, see, or read. If someone wants to read a story that has 'bad words' in it, so be it. Others should @CAPS7 ruin the experience by marking the words out. @CAPS7 only is it rude and ruining the experience for the reader, but it is also destroying someone else's property. If someone wants to view something that is against a certain religion, so be it. They have the right and no one can take that right away from them. In my opinion, censorship in libraries, whether by government, or other civilians, should @CAPS7 be allowed. We citizens are allowed the right to make our own choices and in @CAPS8 libraries, the @CAPS8 should be allowed to read or watch whatever they want. Choice is one of the prinicples of the constitution, and it should be protected, @CAPS7 limited",4,4
3993,I do not think they should be removed at all. They show a persons opinion on something. We can't just disregard it because we dont like what its saying. Thats like us saying black people aren't allowed here because we don't like how you look. Or just anyone that we dont like how they look.     I think anyone who wants to speak their mind should be able to without having to worry about censorship. I @MONTH1 not agree with all the statements they bring up but they should have a fair chance like anyone else would. You should restrict to age accordingly to content so you don't have little kids reading about stuff they really shouldn't be.     I could get a book removed because it offends me. Well then I could get a franchise closed because it offends me. People are offened by little things and should jut except the fact that other people have different opinions. It's just like judging a person for their race. They have differnt morales and values and you can't just change that in a person.     Like if you don't like this article just don't read it. Don't say other people can't read it because of your views. I don't think there should be censorship.,3,4
4708,"Censorship      @CAPS1 you are trying to find the right book, music, movie, magizine, you @MONTH1 come across some interesting ones. Should libraries ban certain books just because of some contend on one page? The person has that ability to read that book or not.      Banning books has been a huge problem in today's society and needs to be stopped. People should be old enough to choose a book that they enjoy and not have to worry about, does this libary have the book that I want. They should not have to think that way @CAPS1 going to a library. @CAPS1 you think of some of the worst books out there, who would want to read those anyway. Many books that people think are bad just have a terrible word on one page. They do not think that they are banning a perfectly good book for others. @PERSON2's '@CAPS2 @CAPS3' was a big upror wheather or not to put the book on the shelfs. The book intailed the @CAPS4 word, and some people were not pleased in this sequence. The book was very well written and just had a few bad words. Should a few bad words keep a book from being a prize winner. The book was such a great story and should be read by many people and should not be kept in a storage room in boxes.      There are many ways to keep a certain age from gettting a certain book. The library could put those certain books in @CAPS5 own part of the library. Keeping the books in a different part of the library might be a better suited way instead of banning the books altogether. The book still will be censored to be in that section or not, but we still will have those wonderful books that we all love so much. What if there was a great informative book about how to do a certain task and no one knew how to do it. That book contained bad language, should the health and knowledge of the world go down because of some bad material in a book, that could help us in the near future.      Authors have just the same right as we do. They should get a say in wheather @CAPS5 own book is liable to be on the shelfs. The government should not get all the say in this series matter in hand. The community and the author that writes it should get more of the say then anyone else. @CAPS1 an author writes a novel they think of the great content they are putting into this great piece of art not thinking of, is this suitable for children to read. The author just loves to write and should not have to think of all the concerns that they should just not worry about.      There is this book we read this year called '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 Are @CAPS7 @CAPS8'. This book had language that I do not think would be suitable for others in some content that was in the novel. Now do I think the the novel should be banned from a library? No, because it used the words in a very nonviolent way. @CAPS1 reading it I felt that I was not harmed by the content and neither were any of my fellow classmates. @PERSON1 was the author of this book and I thought she did an excellent job of writing this piece of literature. So the next time you think of banning a book think of all the warm hearts you could be crushing",5,4
3415,"No i do not think that books and other materials should be taken off the shelves of a library if someone thinks its offensive. Everyone has a different opinion on what books they like to read.           I think that if you dont like the book and think its offensive that you shouldnt get the book and just leave it there because someone else might like that book and want to read it. Not everyone likes the same books but every book in a library is there for a reason. The library screans all of the books that they get in and wouldnt buy something if no one asked for it or  if it wasnt a good book to have.     I think that everyone has a right to read what they like to read and that no one should have the right to take books off of shelves in a library because what if someone is looking for that book and the library is the only place that has it. Then where would people spend their time reading and enjoing the books that they have an intrest in? If everyone could just pull a book off a shelf when they thought it was offensive there wouldnt be any books left on the shelves and no one would have books to read.  I also think that if you dont like the selection of books on the shelf that you shouldnt be lookin in that section, go to another part of the library and look at the types of books that you like to read. Theres something for everyone in a library.     This is why i think its not a good idea to be able to take books off of shelves, no one would have any books that they like to read if everyone did that when they saw something 'offensive'.",3,3
4504,"Pornography, vulgar language, grotesque scenes and many other things make books and movies inappropriate for some. In a culture like the one we have @DATE1, censorship usually takes the back seat. The media constantly portrays sensual elements and the language is also bad. People have always had a right to view what they want and read what they want due to the freedom that this very country provides. Every person is titled with their own opinion but there should not be censorship in libraries.     There are many things in libraries @DATE1 that portray bad images and contain questionable content. Books and movies have things in them that indeed children shouldn't view, but the library is not able to take them down. People enjoy seeing and hearing these things, that's why @CAPS1 comes out with more rated @CAPS2 movies than all the other ratings combined. They make the most money off of them. In @DATE1's economy, the library needs to keep these things on their shelf so that they can stay in business. If people are offended by it, then stay away from that area and don't pick up the book or movie. If someone were to decide to take down a book or movie that they view as offensive then they are breaking the freedom that this has. Censorship is an opinion based topic that one cannot make on their own.     As one can see, the censorship of books and movies is not entitled to a personal opinion. It is the duty of the library to keep the freedoms of the people and provide them with the entertainment that they want. Books and movies with adult content in them can also provide insight on what a society should not be like. Parents should modify what their children watch, but as an adult they are able to watch or read anything that they want to",3,3
4291,"Censorship, @CAPS1 or @CAPS2?          I can understand why libraries would decide to keep certain books off their shelves. Libraries are a place for learning and work. If you were sitting near someone at a public library who was reading smut you could feel awkward.      Although some people @MONTH1 find certain items unoffensive, other @MONTH1 disagree. Imagine you are a mother with a young child who decided to wonder through the library. Your child finds a magazine. It's '@CAPS3'. Not something that you are going to want to explain to your child. If the library were to have not kept the magazine, it never would have happened. Libraries are a public place that should be taken seriously.    If people really want to find something that is inappropriate they can find it somewhere else. The modern world today makes it easy for people to find just about anything without a large hassle. Therefore it should be fine to keep certain materials out of our libraries.      How can people take libraries seriously if there are dirty books, or books with rude language, and scandalous themes. If you are trying to get work done or learn and there are distracting items on the shelves then it @MONTH1 make things more difficult. Libraries are serious places and should be treated as such.",3,3
3569,"Censorship. Sometimes it's needed, sometimes it's not. Children of today are exposed to many adult things, whether it is watching tv or a movie, or just witnessing things at home. I believe censorship is neccesary for young children, they shouldn't be exposed to bad launguage, or graphic scenes, or something that is strictly for adults. They will experience these things one day, and they need to be mature enough to understand them. Teenagers on the other hand is a whole different story. They want to hear the bad language and see graphic, gory scenes. It's all about action to the boys, drama for the girls, and everyone wants to hear those juicy details. Censorship won't stop them from moving on to the next movie or book on the shelf that has all these things in them. Even though all teens act like it's not important and that their old enough to see all this, somethimes their probably not. If you think that telling your teenage daughter or son that their not allowed to watch a movie or read a book because of something it says, they'll probably just go log onto the internet and see it anyway. Nothing is censored on the internet, so if your all about censorship, don't go onto to the internet.Adults do not need censorship. There adults, they can make their own decisions and they know what they want to watch or read.Removing things from the shelves of libraries is sometimes needed. There should be sections, children, teens, and adults. There are ratings on movies, and books are written for a certain age limit so everything should be placed accordingly. Censorship is needed, but your parents or guardian are the ones who will most likely tell you whether or not your going to be able to read a book or a watch a movie. Some people find things more offensive than others. So censorship is really in the eye of the beholder. Personally I believe in censorship, but to others, its a waste of time. I wouldn't want my child watching a movie where someone gets brudally murdered and where there cussing every other word. Music can come uncensored and censored, it just depends what you want to hear. Censorship is either loved or hated, its all one big opinion.",3,3
4635,"Censorship in libraries is good in some ways.  People who like to read books should have a wide variety of books.      Things that offend people: for instance, a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 or natives and how they were treated so poorly. But almost anything now days offends peoaple and its rediculous. either way there is always going to be something that someone finds offensive.     My expirience with this situation it really didn't bother me. But I was in a library glancing through a book and I read a paragragh and it had the word, 'nigger,' in it and I found it a little offinsive. That word just really isn't nice.      People like different books movies magazines ect., and some of the greatest movies of all time, well im pretty sure some people find them offinsive in some way. What some might find offinsive, others might think different. Like in magazines my aunt finds them offinsive because of the bathing suit modles in it for addvertising a new swim suit. or for addvertising liquir.     All together, just about everything is offinsive to somone out there. If all the things that people found offinsive was to be removed, then there would hardly be any books movies ect., and not only that it would suck all together",3,3
4367,"I don't believe that we should romove any books, music, movies, magazines, etc. from our libraries due to many reasons.  This is the real world and the things you read about or watch in a movie @MONTH1 be something you don't want your kids to read about or even see.  Life is about learnig new things. To learn about these ideas, you usually read about or see them somewhere.  The only way I would ever remove any of these items from a store is if they were going to seriously harm the people or have a negative effect on them.      If I were to walk into a public library and I saw a book about a girl cutting herself or someone killing another person, I would be the type of person to turn away from it; even thought it is what many kids are reading about today.  Of coarse, every library has books that cover all kinds of topics.  If you were a parent that was worried about your child reading about these kinds of things, well welcome to life.  Most books have a true story behind them and I believe that everyone needs to learn about this kind of stuff sometime in their life.  Most of what we learn today comes from the books we read.     Also, everyone today listens to music.  We find music as a way to relax and have a good time wheather your riding in a car or at a party.  Many of the songs today contain foul language and have sexual meanings, but that doesn't mean that you have to listen to them.  Many older people don't want to listen to these kinds of songs but it is what many kids are listening to today.  What many people don't see though, is that these songs have true meaning behind them and it is really a way of life.     Finally, I believe that magazines, movies, and any other types of media, shouldn't be removed from libraries.  Many people turn to magazines as a way to relax and read about the latest fashions or their favorite athlete.  We watch movie to also relax and have a good laugh every once in a while.  No one should remove these sources of entertainment from our people even if some @MONTH1 think they are inappropriate.       I strongly believe that romoving any books, magazines, movies, music, or any other typed of media would have a negative effect on alot of people.  You would be removing sources of entertainment and ways of learning from people.  How would you feel if you went to your local library one day and most, if not all, materials had been removed?  What would you do if you didn't have any of these materials available to you anymore",4,4
4666,"When you walk into your local library there are thousands of books, magazines, movies, etc. You have different types and styles of books. There are fiction and nonfiction, comedy, horror, children books, and many more. Also what you might not know is some libraries have books that are either sexual, violent, disruptive, and aren't appropriate for young children. They could also have movies and magazines like that and that is not a good influence.     When a young child walks into a library, they would expect to find a book with color, action, pictures, etc. But while they're browsing around they could run into a certain book thats not meant for them and they could end up becoming influenced. A book that is inappropriate for a child could possibly affect a childs life because they could go out into reality and try to immitate a book they have read and it could end up being the wrong decision.     Inappropriate movie and magazines, such as pornagraphic magazines or pictures, rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 movies, shouldn't be allowed in a library. Items like that should be sold in a separate store. Items like these are meant for adults only. We should try to inspire our young children to do whats right and not try to convince them to do anything in a negative way. If you are going to have any of these items kept in your home, then keep them in a place where children can not find them.     The generation that we live in now, most young people only focus on gang violonce, sex, rap music, and drugs and you can find all of this material in movies, books, and songs. If we keep all of these negative minded items out of public places such as libraries and even homes, then there could possibly be some change. Most rap songs you hear these days are either talking about violence, sex, or drugs. Most music should have a positive message to it.      I feel if I see a book, movie, magazine, etc., sitting on a shelf where a young person can see it, I feel I should have the right to remove it because society is not like what it use to be and if we make a change like this, then I feel a few things can change. Eventhough I'm still young I feel my teenage generation should stop all the violence and stop becoming influenced by everything they see or hear, and if we focus on the more important things in life, then this world can be a whole different place.",3,3
4642,"Dear Newspaper,     I would like to start off by sayin that books, music, movies, magazines, etc. are great for kids in libraries. It's great that kids have a place to go in there free time when they have nothing else to do or need a place to read. But some things are not suitable for young kids and young adults.      In high school just walking down the hall you will find out more things than you would probably like to know. Many of them @MONTH1 not be appropriate but whenever you walk into the library its almost as if they are promoting drugs, alcohol, and sex.      Books about drugs are okay to a certain extent, like if they are medicinal drugs. But whenever they are talking about how drugs take the pain away and make everything better, thats when its taken to far. Our kids and future kids do not need to be learning about these sort of things.     Alcohol is the same way. You see alcohol everywhere and kids are doing it at a young age because movies, music, books, etc. are promoting it basically. Our kids do not need to be learning about these sorts of things. We need them to learn about the dangers of alcohol, not how to get drunk and what you do when your drunk.     Advertsements are the worst things that kids could be seeing especially when they are on billbords, fronts of magazines, etc. Kids do not need to be learning these things at such a young age. Kids should be persuaded to play outside and be in sports and have fun with the family or ride there bike.     I feel that these things should be taken out of libraries if they are offensive to some people. Because maybe its for the best that these things are taken off shelves beacuse maybe our kids will be healthier and live longer without being influenced or under pressure about doing drugs and alcohol, etc.                                             Sincerely,                                                           @PERSON1",3,3
3850,"There is alot of different thing that can offensive to all sorts of  people . so if we started taking thing off tv or out of book ,and magazines we would be always takeing stuff out. if it to graphic for kids put it in the adults area. would censorship be the awnser to take out  stuff no. we need to be more aware of where ur children are an there would be less probblem.     If we made the change the age limited on movie we might be even better off . If parent were to watch the movie then the parent would be able to tell them what ok an what not. we need to put more true history stuff in them an make them where you want to watch them we could be teaching kids more stuff so they know.the music should be censorship some what like with rap. there is alot of rap music that should be cleaned up so little kid dont hear it.      There might even be a better way to controll this stuff so little kids cant get a hold of it. We can have teacher help tell the kids an let them no that it not right for them to watch that. we also need to look at some of the new cartoons that are on tv. There are some that need to be clean up. There are also lot of different in what people want. Then there some that dont care about it to. Maybe someday we will figure it out and be able to do it",3,3
3134,"Some people might think that it is a good idea to censor things on library. People might think that some of the material might be offensive of bad for the youth of the people who go to libraries.People might think it @MONTH1 be better to take the bad and offensive item off the shelf. I have a different opion on the subject. I don't think anything should be censored in the library no matter if it deal with book, movies, music, magazines, ect.,     The real question is why should this material be censored removed. The answer to that question is that it should not be sensored  removed. The library is somewhere you can go to get information on just about anything you want. If these items are censored or taken off the shelfs the resources would be limited and or no help to the people searching for the information. Another big problem with censoring or removint these materials is people might be missing out on alot of knowleged that they have never herd of that might be bad or offensive. Such as slavery, the @CAPS1 taking over the @CAPS2, and a lot of our world history. I feel strongly about people knowing about the worlds past.     Now what happens if the items are removed from the shelfs of libraries. what are you going to do with the thousands of books that you can no longer read because it is offensive. We just can't get rid of them just like that. A lot of the offensive stuff is true or based on a true story such as @ORGANIZATION1 park getting arrested because she refused to give up a seat to a white person. so removing these books would be pointless because where ever you put them people will just go there to get the material they want to know about.      The most important thing about this is who want these books censored or gone and why they want to remove them. Okay some book are bad and offensive but you have to look at it this way. People have there own choice on what they want to read , watch,or listen to. So just because some people dont like the material in a library doesn't mean everyone else doesn't like it. It the peoples choice not a opion on what a couple people say.     So at the end i think that books and other items in a library sould not be censored or taken off the shelfs. I believe that people have the right to read, listen, or watch what ever they want. I see it as people opions fighting opions on removing the books. Also if people don't like the book at the library then no one told them thay have to go meaning their opion really doesn't matter",4,4
4090,"I believe that if there are books, music, movies, or magazines that offends you. People shouldn't be able to disarm that material off of the shelf. If it's there children they're worried about just teach them from staying away from adult section. Also, some people don't like foul language but thats there opinion. Than we wouldn't have any material left in the library if everyone had the rights to disarm offensive material. 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any us' (Paterson).     If it's your children your worried about seeing censorship in libraries but, you don't mind it just have them stay in the kids section reading books. You could just go a day where you want to go by yourself so you don't have to worry about your kids spotting any censorship. Before checking the material out skim through it make sure there is nothing offensive for your child.      Many people don't like foul language but, that's there opinion. It doesn't bother me because it gives the book a little taste and it's more interesting. Helps you understand what the reader is feeling upon someone or thing. Sometimes it helps show what mood the reader has in the story.     Finally, if everyone had the right to disarm all the offensive materials, we wouldn't have anything left. This could effect peoples education and reading skills. Some of that material is peoples hobbies they wouldn't be able to do what they like anymore.     'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off of the shelf '(Paterson). It's an easy fix just teach your children from right and wrong. Would you rather have your children have a good education or not know how to read? Many people dislike foul language but it could make the book better. I don't know what I would do if there was no more books. Well these are examples of why people shouldn't have the rights to disarm material off of the shelf if it offends them. What would you do if you had something you loved taken away from you?",3,4
3423,"'Should libraries censor reading material's to students at school.'That is a yes an no quistion because reading is good for people of all age's its just is the topic suitable for certain age group. Yes, I do think they should censor reading material, But to an exstent they need to have books for kids at certain age groups. like have sections for young kids then teens and then adults. if the child wants t read more graphic material then they must have pramission from their parent. the reason i say that is there are things that get published by authord that are ment to be read by certain people.",2,2
3227,"Censorship in libraries in my view isn't a good idea. Library now days have alot of offensive language in there books so if someone were to take all of the book like that out of the library then library wouldn't even have that many books in it. Music is the same way all music now days might have some offensve words in them thats just something people now days have to get over.          I think library censorship is not a good idea. Some parent might not like the idea of there librarys haveing offensive language in the books, music, movies, and magazines. If the parent don't want there children to not read those book then they need to chose there childrens book, but I think takeing all the offensive book of the shelves isn't very smart. Some people enjoy reading and listening to that kind of music.           Some of the best books, and music now days have bad stuff in then like drugs, language, sex, gangs and much more but sometimes books like that can teach you a lesson on how to avoid that going down the road. So if you take those books off the shelves and werent able to listen to that music maybe your child could do some of those things. They really wouldnt know the side effects and bad thing that could come out of those things. Some of the top music and books have offensive materials in then and why would you not let your kid read them because of a couple choice word in them.I know some of this material could be bad for people but sometimes it can teach you a huge lesson in your life.     If there are book you dont want youself to read then don't read them. I think it would be unfair to take everthing that have some bad language or maybe some racism away from us just because you don't think its good for your child to read. Its not fair to people who @MONTH1 enjoy those books to not have the luxary to read those book anymore cause a few parent got mad about a book. Some of the old books have alot of racism in them, and you actually @MONTH1 read some of them in a school for a class. Those book @MONTH1 also have bad language in them to. Take thing those books away from us @MONTH1 take away are education, and we won't be able to learn from those books like we should.          So i think that censorshipn in library is just a horrible idea. It can take away from lesson we could learn and are education that we need to be successful in life",3,4
3344,"Offensive media is everywhere. From books to music lyrics, our culture embraces us with it. Children that see inappropriate media can pick up bad behavior. This can then lead to a child having a hard time associating with his peers. Adults are also affected by inappropriate media if they see their favorite celebrity or  any other role model use inappropriate behavior. This could make an adult emotionally unhealthy and they @MONTH1 become violent or depressed. Finally, our world could be better if offensive media were abolished altogether. People's lives could be enriched with good, clean entertainment instead of being corrupted with inappropriate media. One can clearly see that offensive media must be pulled from our country's libraries immediatley.     Inappropriate media is surrounding us daily, including children. What children see they imitate, even in the first couple years of their lives. So if they hear a swear word on t.v or see someone doing drugs, they @MONTH1 imitate it. Clearly this is inappropriate behavior for a child. If the child is exposed to inappropriate media, for a long period of time, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to use it in everyday life. Their social skills and mind is being corrupted because of offensive media. Libraries should pull inappropriate media off of their shelves because it can corrupt a child's mind.      Another reason why  libraries should pull off offensive media is because adults can pick up different offensive habits as well. Just as children can pick up the offensive habit of swearing , so can adults if they are exposed to it for a long period of time. Besides swearing, adults can also think that killing someone is ok because they saw it in a movie. They could then pick up a violent weapon and try to kill someone if they are angry. This is not a healthy way to express your feelings towards someone if they are making you angry. Our country's libraries should pull off inappropriate media from their shelves because it can turn adults into being emotionally unhealthy.      Finally , inappropriate media should be pulled off library shelves because our world could be a better place without it. Media is one of the root causes of why people act the way they do. If they see their favorite celebrity getting arrested for a @CAPS1  in a magazine, they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to drink and drive. Another example is if people read about someone doing drugs in a book, they @MONTH1 want to try and experiment with drugs  themselves. This can lead to people doing crazy things that can be harmful to other lives around them.      Offensive media is almost anywhere. When children see inappropriate media , they @MONTH1 think that it is ok to imitate it. Adults, when exposed to enough offensive media, can pick up nasty habits like swearing, killing or doing drugs which , inturn , can lead to to being emotionally unhealthy. With out inappropriate media on our library shelves, our world would be a better place. We would have less conflict, less deaths ,and better lives that are enriched, not corrupted , with quality media. Millions of lives could be made better if libraries pulled off inappropriate media from their shelves",3,3
3905,"Do I belive that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should be remove from the shelves if they are found offensive @CAPS1 choice is no. I have several reasons for that one is that this is a free country and a person has the right to speak on how they feel or whats on there mind. And that should be aceptable any where cause every on has their on opinion about what they like or read. And if you feel that it offen you maybe you shouldn't be reading it or watching it or what ever the case @MONTH1 be. You can find something else to read that you'll enjoy or your friends and family @MONTH1 like,                    @CAPS1 second reason is that you can learn from stuff that @MONTH1 offen you and any kind of way. Such as this magazine I read about black males sagging there pants many white people that seen there pants below there waist had something negative to say about the young men. They only jugde a book by its cover because they didn't know nothing about the person, that they was talking about and one of the black males was a honor student in high school that was going to attend a white college. And when many whites started to find out they begin to question the young man about how he dress and why. He told them this is a free country I can do what ever I like and whites liked that he spoke up for his self.                               So with @CAPS1 reason being said I find it not right to remove certain materials,such as books, music, magazines, etc, should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. So I hope you enjoyed reading @CAPS1 essay. If you have any arguments or questions you can surely contact me",3,3
4664,"I think that if a book can be published then it should be able to be in a library. If a book is published then it means it's open to the public so I don't see why it can't be in the libraries. If a book has to be removed from a library then why did they buy it?      I really don't see the need to take a book off the shelf in a library. If someone dosen't like it then they don't have to get it. I beleive that only the owner of the library should be the only one to take a book off a shelf because it is their own store, but why would they waste the money in buying the book.     The public shouldn't be able to remove books from libraries because not everyone likes the same kind of books. Everyone has different views also. If anyone could remove  books from libraries then there wouldnt be any books in the library.     A book is a book. Not a criminal so why remove books from libraries? If a book can be published then it can be put in libraries. There is no reason for a book to be taken off the shelf because its been published so it's already open to the public.",3,3
3899,"Walking in to the library and looking for a good book or magazine to read, you run into some of those disgusting books that are offensive to some people. Some people think they should be removed from the shelves, and I am one of them. Are you?     There are some books, magazines, movies, and ect., that we all run into that have very bad language, racism, bad religious talking, and even some about sex. Nobody needs to be reading those kind of books, it is bad for our minds and is very offensive to some people. A lot of people do not like to hear curse words or see them. Seeing those words in a book will make that person think wrong things about the library and put the wrong words in their head. Then there are those books about racism and that is the worst topic to most people. If someone came across that in a book, it would hurt their feelings and they would not want to finish that book. Their are others that are very religious and if they come across something that is wrong about their religion the will be very offended.      There are a few ways that the library could handle the books that offend people. The librarian could think about putting a warning sign up and seperating those books, magazines, and etc., into their own section for people that do get offended by those things know where they are and know not to look there. Or inside the front cover the librarian could put a warning note on there to show the person that there are some things in there that @MONTH1 offend someone. It would be very helpful to so many people!      In every library you won't see that all the books are perfectly good. We all know that there are going to be some bad things in books, but there are some books that are way too inapropriate and those books can be removed. There are just way too many people that get offended while reading the books they want to read. Let's put a stop to it.     In conclusion, many of the libraries around are going to have the kind of books that offend some people. There can be a stop to that by removing them from the shelves or at least warning others about the things in the books, magazines, and all the other entertainment people like these days. It would be amazing to know that all the people that love to read will not be offended by what they are reading!",4,4
3703,"I do not think that libraries or any one should have censorship to books, movies, music, magazines ect. People who put there time to writing all of there thought and ideas in that should not be just thrown off the shelf. People who wrote that stuff have freedom of seach and the wright to write that stuff or say that stuff.      Yes I have read books that I have found offensive or that I don't like, but I dont think they should not be in libraries. They are there because some other people @MONTH1 like that kind of stuff no reason why we should exclude what they like to read out of the libraries that everyone shares and goes to. There would be nothing left in libraries because almost everything out there someone could find offensive.     For example people such as @ORGANIZATION1. People say his lyrics and music say alot of bad stuff but most of his music is about him and his life. He has the freedom of speach to wright and publish that for the world to see and hear. His music is just i @CAPS1 of his life. In history @CAPS2 because he killed people. Should take him off the shelf because jews @MONTH1 think it was offensive, yeah it might be but it lets people know about our history and what has happened. If we keep that cencored who know history my repeat its self. which is a saying I have heard many of times.          So censorship or not I just think they had the freedom of speach to write that stuff down and be put in a library for people to see learn, edgucate, and entertain themselves by. Doesn't mean if it offeneds you that its offensive to other people",3,4
4452,"Should books,music,magazines, etc., be removed form shelves that are found offensive? Everyone has their own oppion on that question. In my years of reading I have read a few books that were questionable. I wouldn't say someone else couldn't relate to it.      Personaly i don't think anything should be removed from the shelves. While growning up our parents try to keep us from things, at that point in life don't need to see. I can agree with age limit but you can't hide everything. Isn't it best to let the children know whats out there before you just letting them go to find out on there own?     You would probably get multiple answers to that question. My personal views @MONTH1 be different from the person sitting bestide me, but I think you should be able to have the right to read, see, and litsen to what you want. The world is not a safe place, its scary and mean to the people. When I raise my children, when they're younger there will be certin things that they wont know and wont see. But thats just part of raising your kids, when they get older and start asking quesions i'm going to answer with the truth.     Is keeping these things from our children lying to them? I would have to say yes to that question. By taking these things away from the youth we are telling them that its not out there, that the world is perfect and there is no wrong. Some people would actually say that, but I have to say to them that they haven't lived. Still to this day there is segregation to all people not just against races but in our own race itself.     To conclude my oppion I would have to say that we should be free to read and see what we want. We shouldn't, not let anyone see it and them and then let them out in the world, and have a complete culture shock. Teach your children whats out there, let them know the truth about the world. Should certain materials be removed from shelves? No, @CAPS1 is to judge what we see and hear?",3,4
3175,"Libraries contain many different selections of books, music, and magazines. However, are all of these materials appropriate for all @CAPS1 visitors? In this essay I will explain to you why I think offensive, distracting and inappropraite material should be removed off of the shelves, and put into their own section of public @CAPS2.     If a small child were to walk into a public @CAPS1 and pick up a book about abortions, they would not know what the book is talking about, because most small children cannot read. What if a fifth grader was to pick that same book up? They would be able to read  the whole thing with no problems. However, should a fifth grader be allowed to pick up a book about abortions at such a young age? I dont think so, fifth graders should be reading age appropriate books. This is just one reason why I think offensive, distracting and inappropriate material should be moved to its own section of the @CAPS1.     When I think of a @CAPS1 I think of a quiet place that I can go to and read, or study. Although, some Libraries allow their visitors to listen to music. Rather it be on a computer, on a ipod, or even on a cell phone, there should be a sound limit right? Most people would think that Libraries set sound limits, and they probably do, but people do not follow directions and they are not attentive to what other people are doing. It is @CAPS6 distracting to go into a @CAPS1, to study, and the person next to you has their ipod blasted to a heavy metal rock song. Once again, this is another reason I think offensive, distracting, and inappropriate material should be moved to its own area of the @CAPS1.     I also think that a @CAPS1 is a community place, that you can go to and be safe, and your parents would not have to go with you because they think that it is safe and appropriate too. Most Libraries have magazines, because its for your entertainment, and they want to keep you happy so you will keep coming back. Well not all magazines are rated @CAPS10, some have @CAPS6 inappropriate material in them. A child should be looking at magazines that are appropriate for children, a teenager should be looking at magazines that are for teenagers, and an adult should be looking at magazines for adults. However the adult magazines should not be showing people with barely any clothes on, or any sexual scenes, and neither should teenage magazines. With innapropriate magazines, I do not think they should have their own section of the @CAPS1, I think they should be removed all together. They have pictures in them and anyone can look at a picture.     I really hope you can understand my point of view. It is nothing against public Libraries, it is just the material inside of them. If I owned a public @CAPS1, I would have rooms devoted to books that are for different age groups. For example, I would have a room for @NUM1+, and a room for @NUM2+. Those rooms would be for the books that are easily questionable for younger children. I would also have my own room devoted for music only. That way anyone could go in the room and listen to whatever kind of music they want, no questions asked. The rest of the @CAPS1 would be for people to study, and read. I think every @CAPS1 should be like this, it would help make the world a better place",4,4
3799,I believe that books should not be taken off the shelves of libraries because without books we would not know anything about life to survive. The books and media help the human race sympathize with eachother and know about things that already happend so that we don't repeat history and do it all over again. Some books are made up for entertainment and others are for education and help children learn about what happend in the past.Taking books off the shelfs of schools and libraries would be uncalled for because you are taking away from children who have nothing else to turn to besides school and knowing what the teachers are talking about in the classrooms. Books that are offensive should be taken off the shelves but not the books that make sense to people and help you suceed in life.         some schools don't have books to read because they are in a poor country and don't have much to do besides go to school and learn. books are important in so many ways that it would be a lot of drama if they took books off of shelves because people all around the world need to know about everything that has been done and the people who done it. some books don't make sense but that doesent matter if it does or don't.,3,3
3481,"Many books in libraries have profanity, it just depends on how you read and anazlyze the profanity. To some people the strong words help the reader get the point across their head. To others the words are just offensive. I disagree that most books are offensive to readers I believe that they just help the writers get their points across.      Many children come across books with offensive language, but if they only read books that are within their age level then they shouldn't have these problems. In adult books there is more offensive language, but to adults eyes and ears its a different story because they hear, and possibly say a lot of the words that they are seeing in these books anyhow.     I believe that any offensive reading material should be found and then sent to a certain area of the library where if you are an adult then you can check these books out. This is a way to keep the children away from these books, words, and to keep them 'innocent' still. Children don't need to be reading books with offensive language anyhow, but of course this is up to their guardian.     It's not necassarily a bad thing to have strong language in books, as long as the reader that has the book is taking it in the way the writer is intending, which is most likely to help the theme. Children should be kept away from these books but they should not be completely removed from the shelves. They should just be put in their own area for adults to read only",4,4
4029,"Do you think that books, movies, music, etc., should be moved if they are found offensive? I can't choose @CAPS3 they are both understandable. Therefore, I well dicuss how i feel about it in this essay and what I have experience on this topic.     Well lets get started! I could go both ways with this. But first I well just discuss the way I disagree with removing offensive things. Material that is instersting to many people mght not be instersting to me. I mean everyone should be able to listen and read things that the loved and enjoy. And I could really careless what other people loved to read and listen to. Someday, we all might come to enjoy things that we wouldn't every think we would. It's just that simply. I mean I love romance and scary books, and someone else might dislike them both. Noone can tell anyone what they should like or dislike.          I agree in away too! When people make a big deal out of somethings it kind of gets on your nerves, like when your mom is telling you make sure room is clean all the time! I agree with this @CAPS3 something maybe to offensive to someone and doesn't want their children. One time I was in a library looking at this book that really seemed good to read. But then some lady told me that I shouldn't read it @CAPS3 it to much for me. But it was just right for me. @CAPS2 went up to the main desk and started complaining. I was like, 'Are you serious?' I didn't want to be rude so I told her calmly, '@CAPS1 are you so worried about what I am reading?' @CAPS2 replied, ' @CAPS3, the book is to reviling.' I showed her what the book was called, '@CAPS4 @CAPS5 @CAPS6'. We ended the agruement. I still checked out the book, @CAPS3 I knew I would love it, and I do! They should just put things aside, that they think well be offensive and let people ask for the things. So people won't make a big deal out of it. Just keep the peace and give everyone what they want.          Well I'm done now. Hope you understand both sides of the agruement. Just remember that if you agree or disagree.Or you like me, who can't choice or understands both sides. It's your decision and noone can make you change what you love and enjoy to read or listen to. But I can't pick aside @CAPS3 either way their both a understandable.",3,3
3222,"Do I think materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removed from the book shelve if they found offensive? Yes I do beause why keep it on ther if it's offensive to young kids and other people.     If it dosen't have nothing do with learning then it shouldn't be on ther. Its sertin things kids should read so if they want to put materials that are made for adults then they should put it in a sepreat section from the kids section.     They shouldn't have any music or movies that have some type of violents in it because the kids now days have to much violents as it is.The only way they should put music or movies on there is if they have learning materials in it.     So I think you should put books, music, movies, and magazines on the shelve only if they contain learning maertails and things that would persuad them to do some in they life.",3,3
3493,"I think books that have nudity, curse words, or gang related violence should be put in either a adult shelf or taken off for good. They show kids stuff they shouldnt see or do when they get older. They just arent appropriate. No childeren should know about drugs, sex, or epspecially gang violence. Its stuff they should never even find out about. So i think we should take them books off the shelf, if people want to read them they can go buy themselves a copy.",2,2
3124,"Have you ever been offended by a movie, book, song, or magazine? Did you have a choice on whether or not you watched and/or read the item? The question that seems to be of intrest to people is should these items that are offensive be taken off the shelves. I don't think they should.     I am sure that you could ask anyone if they have ever been offended by a movie, book, or magazine and all of them could give an example. I doubt they ever watched the movie again and if they did it obviously wasn't that bad. If something offends you, don't read or watch it. If you don't want your kids watching something, don't let them. You can make that desicion. No one is making you watch or read any of that.     I know I have watched a movie or two that I probably shouldn't have. I've even read some books that are not the best, but I choose to read them. No one forced the act on me.     Some of you @MONTH1 ask, '@CAPS1 about at school?' If a teacher assigns a book to read and your child does not feel comfortable with it, then take it up with the teacher. They will be more than understanding and possibly give your child a different book. They might even explain why he or she is having the class read the book and why the children need to be exposed to this type of literature.     There are always going to be offensive books and movies out there. If you take out all the books in a library that has offended someone at one point in time, you probably wouldn't have much of a library left. The shelves would be bare.     You have a choice to read or watch something. If it is offensive don't watch it. Everyone has different views on that book or movie. It @MONTH1 be offensive to you, but to the next person it might be a really good show. I don't think offensive books, magazines, music, or movies should be taken off the shelves.",4,4
4402,"Yes there are many things today that have censorship,but should keep them out of our libraries.I think not.They should not be taken items out of the libraries do to censorships.Maybe if they are such a big concern they could do something else with them besides taking them out.     I don't believe that they shouldn't take out censorship items out of the libraries just becase some people have a problem with it.Becase now a days you can go out in public and hear the same stuff they put in those censored movies,games,@CAPS1's,etc.I think that if they are even thinking about taking cencored product out of the library it should be up to the library and not the goverment.     If censorship is such a big problem with people they dont have to check it out or look at it. So maybe if they are having problem's with parents becase there kids are checking he censored items out they should have a band.Like if you want to out a item with a censorship you either have to be @NUM1 or have a parent or guardin with you.But if it is still have a problem with it make it like tabacco products were you have to be @NUM1.     Then if the libraries don't want to do that they could make a whole room just for censored items.They sould also put the room in a corner or in a less populated area of the library.There should also have to have a sign saying there are sencorhip items in that room and, maybe a sign saying @NUM1 and older.     So there are many other was to dealing with censored items.Sence there are so many was to deal with them why take them out.We should not have to take censorship item out just becase some people do not like it.why punish every one becase of a few people",3,3
3845,"I think that if it is a problem for others and not all why can't we just seperate the things in sections. That way there would be no problems.    I mean, why change something if only a few people doesn't like something? Thats only goning to lead to a big conflict. Think about if we were to tr and give everyone what they want, @CAPS1 would that work out not good at all. So you should just limiy thing dow and put them in setions.",2,2
4365,"Katherine stated that if everyone had the right to take a book off the shelf then there wouldn't be any books left. I think what she is saying is that many people think of a book that is innappropriate, but in another persons eye the book could also be appropriate. Censorship is a big deal no-a-days. Nobody wants there young children to read about drugs and/or violence. I have many opinions upon this issue.     First I will state why I think the books, or movies, or whatever should be taken off the shelf. The books, movies, magazines, ect. should be taken off the shelf for being to innappropriate. The books and movies are innappropriate by having drugs, sex, violence, and many other things in them that young children shouldn't be subject to watching or reading. I know if I was a parent I would not want my young child reading of a violent murder, or gangs.      The other thing about censorship that it is the peoples choice to read an innappropriate book, or watch an innappropriate movie. As a kid myself that is growing up, I didn't really care for reading anyways, but the books that were the best sometimes were the ones with violence in them. Also even thought the book @MONTH1 be innappropriate, the child still should have a say in what they are reading. This is where my next thought comes in. You have to think about the kids that are mature too. The kids that are mature, and it is just a hobby to read, @MONTH1 not have any books of their style left to read if they were all 'taken of the shelf'. This goes for parents too. If they have a book at their house, the child could easily pick it up and read it there.     What the book stores, libraries, and movie stores should do, is put an age limit on the books and movies. I know that for @CAPS1 rated movies there is an age limit, but for explicit books i do not think there is an age limit. They could also maybe even get a letter or a note with parent concent on it, so the children could get the book or magazine. Maybe the parent should even just come in and get the book or movie for the child. The libraries, or book stores, or movie stores could also easily put a warning on the side of the cover to show that the book @MONTH1 be innappropriate to some. What the children read is only up to two people: the child and the parent. If the parent doesn't care that the child is reading or watching an innappropriate movie then it should be no problem.     Therefore, I think in order to withhold the buying and selling of books, there has to be the option to obtain the innappropriate ones. I feel that even though the material @MONTH1 be explicit, the kids, with their parent's concent, should have the option to check out or buy mostly anything. Afterall, the book @MONTH1 be about violence, drugs, or sex, but the children are still reading which is always good",4,4
3851,"A lot of people believe that books are useless and should not even be on a shelf. Well I believe that no book is useless nor should it be removed from shelves from any library. All books are worth something toward anything like careers, and being able to learn new things.          Magazines @MONTH1 not be any help towards alot of things like books are, but they are something to entertain you. Music is not just something you listen to, but its something to help keep you nice and relaxed while you are reading a book. Movies can have a certain impact on someone; alot of people think movies are just entertainment for them to watch, but it could have some encouragement, or it can really show how a person acts if you really pay attention and look into what the movie is saying.      No book, magazine, music, or movies should be taken off shelves because they are not there for you to read or listen to or watch, but those things are all there to tell people something about things people do not even know. People should take a second look at how all of these things can really affect a persons life. More books, magazines, music, and movies should be put in the libraries of school, or even the public libraries.The more people read, watch, or listen to these things the better they @MONTH1  understand life. I have noticed from experience that people just go to the library and read a book just to relax, but yet at the same time those people really do not understand what they are reading. Its really a shame that people do not look into what they are reading, thats why it would be important for more books to be put on the shelves. Just like Katherine Paterson said: 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf , the work I abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If people really understood what that quote really means then they would have a better understanding of what books actually mean in life. We should be thankful to have authors like Katherine Paterson in our life because these authors are there to help us understand the meaning of these amazing books in this world.",3,3
3412,"Offensive @CAPS1 @CAPS2     @CAPS3 entering a @CAPS1 you know your are going to find something interesting to read,listen to, or even watch. Most people use librarys to find information on a certain topic, some of these topics are not always appropiate for certain age groups. I do believe that materials on any subject should reflect how people see the world now. Most kids go to the @CAPS1 and look to find books that interest them, sometimes they cross book about stuff they should'nt know about yet. Libraries should be allowed to have anything on there shelf that they please but allow it to certain age groups.     @CAPS3 you were a little kid and you wanted to look up information on racing, you might have passes by many books about racism. As a little kid you might not know what that is but all you have to do is pick up and read. That kid just went from reading abot nascar to reading about racism and different races. I believe that book should be kept in order of age. @CAPS3 a teenager goes into the @CAPS1 to look up a book, they should be able to go to a section for teens and get a book on there topic. In most libraires there are topics such as sex, killing , and viloent matters. Kids should not be allowed to view that detail until they are ready for it.     If I am at the @CAPS1 I will always look for a book interest me. My skills on choosing books for myself has changed since i was @NUM1 or @NUM2. Now that older and like to read, I read more books about action and mystery. I was at the our hometown @CAPS1 and saw a @NUM3 year old kid looking at books about pregnancy and was shocked to see what he was reading after he put the book down. That same day I came across a younger kid approaching his father with a book about sex and one about killing. @CAPS3 I saw this I was suprised to see what was happening. I do believe that libraries should be able to showcase what they have but in certain age sections..     Kids visit the @CAPS1 all the time and looking for books to strike interest and will always find something different that they should not be exposed too. Libraires would have trouble containg what kids read, so they should exposed all the differnt topics. @CAPS3 your little and your reading about these topics, you will then be more informed @CAPS3 your just little older.     Next time @CAPS3 you visit the @CAPS1 check and see what kids in your local towe are talking and reading about. You will be suprised @CAPS3 a child apporachs his parents with a book about sex. I think that all libraies should exposed what they want @CAPS3 they want to ensure knowledge to everyone.",4,4
3031,"Every library has tons of information on just about everything.  There are tons of books, music, movies, magazines and more that contain this information.  There is even some information that some people might take offence to.  On the other hand, somebody else could be perfectly fine with it.  I think that all libraries should keep all their books on the shelfs, no matter what kind of content they contain, because not everybody takes offence to some contents in books, and it is the same way vice versa.     The subject race might come into play in some books in libraries.  Books have information about people doing things to other people just because of their race.  Some people want books took out of their libraries because of the content that they contain, but really it could be a n important part of history that people need to be educated about.  Some books have words that are very offencive to people because of their skin color, relgion, or ethnic race.  This information that people need to know because thats how people were treated back then and some stuff like that still occurs today.     Libraries have all kinds of information.  I think that all the books at libraries should stay there no matter what they contain.  Even if some content is offensive some people it could still be a important part of history that people need to know",3,2
4699,"Have it ever occured to you that some of the things we read about and take home from libraries are not for young children?   Certain materials that are found in libraries are sometimes not age appropriate or even offensive to other people. Not all books, music, movies, and magazines offend people or condone in things but they also give children the right to learn about things or know things that are to rated and shouldnt be learned at a library. Most music in todays society is not appropiate because of the content that is used such as sex,drugs, and violence. last fall when I visited my shools library I came across a movie that I thought was not school appropiate and should'nt be seen without a parents verification. Anything about sex and drugs give young teens and children the right away to do it even if they read it, heard it, or saw it in school.  when im walking through the town and I see teens doing things that should'nt be done the first thing the first thing he/or she says is 'I heard it on a movie'. Most public lbraries have movies, book, music, and etc on shelves that aren't appropiate but it should'nt be welcomed to young children. most librians are busy and cant watch the entire library, but can make sure it is secured and put away from juveniles.   Most of the time a child will read what looks interesting and fun. Todays books that condone violence have guns drugs and sexual content on the front cover making it hard for a child not to want to read it. In a school library @PERCENT1 of the time all books are age appropiate, but in a public library it's not because the public library is not just for children but for adults too. some books shouldnt be of shelves but the rated things should be.  In conclusion libraries need to watch what's being checked out no matter who its from and I.d should be asked for.",3,3
4327,"I think that @CAPS4 is fine if you take them out. Your should be @NUM1 or older to take them out of the libraries or stores if they are really that bad. If they are that bad they should have something on them like movies that are rated @CAPS1.     I have read some books that are really good,but kids shouldn't read them. I read this book @CAPS3 'A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @CAPS4' and @CAPS4 is really sad.@CAPS4's about this @CAPS2 and he tells us what his mom makes him do when he was little. I liked the book but @CAPS4 was sad,but I read @CAPS4 because people were talking about @CAPS4.     Some parents won't let their children watch certain things on the t.v. because they think that they are bad. I was watching this t.v. show at my grandma's house and she said that I shouldn't watch @CAPS4 but I do. I'm @NUM1 years old so I think I should be able to pick what I watch. I don't think she likes @CAPS4 because they yell a lot on the show and she says that is why I yell.     Some movies are better if they have bad things in them, @CAPS4 makes them funny sometimes and that is what everyone likes. I would rather watch a funny movie then a kid movie. I watched them before though",2,2
4252,"Hiding @CAPS1?                                                  By: @PERSON1 to the harsh world we all live in, I do not believe it is morally correct for a program, of any kind, to hide the hard reality of our world from any person.      @CAPS1 will be @CAPS1 and one shouldn't ever hide what is true from the eyes of another person's mind. If one person makes the choice to close his eyes and go into a fantasy world then that is one person's right as a human being. However, one man has no right- whats so ever- to close the eyes of another person for them.     Personally, I myself am not afraid to look into the history of man's choices and take upon myself the burden of the harsh knowledge that I have inherited. I look at the human race of this planet to be whole and to be one with another. This planet doesn't belong to one race, nation or culture of people; it belongs to every single person equally. I made the decision to take on the resonsibility to know the past and use it's lessons to better the future. This world belongs to me as equally as it belongs to you; so my decisions will affect you as much as they affect me. That being stated, every person's decisions impact everyone, not just one's self.     People think that we should hide things that are 'offensive' to other people. Racism, world political issues, casualties of war and personal ethics- are some of these 'offensive' things. However, offensive or not, these subjects are very real and very much alive in our world; So why should anyone have the right to try to make these subjects dissappear for another person?      In @LOCATION1, everyone has the right to freedom of speech and expression, but how can these freedoms be carried through if people remove these expressed ideas and beliefs from the shelves of the readers? We all have a right to make the decisions that affect our world and if this world is equally owned by everyone, then everyone's decisions are equally burdened by everyone. That being said, we all have the right to know the decisions, actions, and the concequencies of these decisions and actions that our people all create every single day.     In conclusion, I believe that our world is harsh and also beautiful. Being that of which it is, I believe it is every man's right to live and decide the way he wants to. No man should ever make another person's decisions for them. Everyone is resonsible for their own life and how their life affects other people. However, no one has responsibility to hide or change the world around us from any person, for it is the knowledge of the people that make the world what it is and it is the knowledge of the world that influences a person's decisions",4,5
4232,"When you go into a library have you ever seen the many subjects people write about? Some from their own experience and some made up. I personally disagree that offensive books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed. The authors or producer of these sort of entertainment were made to be read, hear or watched by people that are interested in them! Also if the libraries are having diffculties with the complainments towards the offensive materials they should just make a separate section.     To begin with, why are books, music, movies, and magazines produced for? Easy one! To entertain us; to expand our knowledge on things; to let us have intrest. If none of these things were invented, life would be boring, now i'm not saying we need these offensive materials, i'm saying it's there so we can think bigger about topics instead of them same-o-same-o. Producer produced 'offensive' material to catch attention and to be read, not so they can sit on the far back of library where nobody goes just because it has some things others @MONTH1 not like. If you don't like those type of things, stay away from them, don't bother reading or listening to them! Why should libraries stop the people that made those things from making money? Does that seem right to you? It's bad enough they're sencond guessing if they're good enough to be shelve worthy. There's many books out there that are horible and a waste of time reading it, so should they be removed to? Think about that one.     Secondly, I disagree with the removal of these type of materials because libraries could always make a separate section. It @MONTH1 cost money, but what's more better loosing tons of costermers or finding extra room? Libraries are very big already and i'm sure they could find a little bit more room, they separate everything into genres already.     Although I see where others come from about removing these kinds of  materials from shelves. There @MONTH1 be some cautious parents that don't want their children exposed to that sort of stuff. Teenagers especially, they @MONTH1 get ideas of the language and scenes from these sort of stuff. I once read a story about a man that read a book one of his old pals from college wrote about killing women and teering there inside out, this man got a idea to do it to his mother. He beat his mom and cut her body open, leaving the insides on the outside lawn. The man is in jail now and the book was removed from shelves. Still I don't think it should have been removed because an imature, ignorate person thought it would be cool to do it. The book was made up and the guy was most likely dellusional and sick in the head to do it. And because of his actions and author has to suffer from money lost and big waste of his time and effort he put into it.     In conclusion no type of material should be removed because it has been found offensive. Some people just have ignorance to not understand the books, music or movies was made for entertainment for those who like that kind of stuff exposed. Like i've said recently it was made to be either read; heard; or watched. A separate section would be a great idea.",4,4
3950,"Do I believe that certain materials , such as books, music, movies,magazines, and so on should be removed? Yes I think that they should all be removed, becuase it could hurt people's feelings, and could make them do plenty of things. Such as suicide, drama, and so on having any of these things at a library could hurt someone's feelings. I really dont think that I would like having racial comments about me in a book so why would anyone else? I think that by removing all these things could make some peoples lifes better.     From exsperince in the library last week, I seen this girl that ran to her mom crying becuase she was african american, and the book said something about thier race. And she was all worried that what happend back in the day with all the slavery would happen again. I would be so terified reading about people that would make fun of my life, call me names, and beat me, that kind of thing would just ruien my day. Now I think that library's would learn to take this certain stuff out of stock.     Now that I have gave you convincing arguments about my choice from my own experience. I think that they should take my advice, and realize that having that kind of stuff is not good for kids,teenagers, or even adults that they should not be reading that stuff. All it does is bring some people down, make them cry, and also so stupid stuff. Now by making the choice to remove all this stuff would be smart, and make things better for everyone",3,2
3364,"Censorship is important. Especially pertaining to what books, magazines, movies, and music almost all people are reading, watching, and listening to. Some of the media such as books and magazines and such in libraries everywhere can be highly offensive to certain people or can send off the wrong message to children and teens. So, should we take them off the shelves?     I personally think no, most media aspects that are on the shelves in libraries can be very offensive to people, but alot of it has to do with people's opinions. The readers are the ones that are claiming that the books and other media aspects in libraries are offensive. The authors and directors and singers just do what they do, and the judgement and opinions all come from the people, fans, and critics. We shouldn't be taking it all off library shelves just because it is offensive to some people.     This leads back to the quote from Katherine Paterson when she states: 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' We can't take everything off the shelves because everyone's opinions are different so if we censor everything, there won't be anything left. Right now, they are doing a good job with censoring everything such as putting a rating on video games, and movies. Rated @CAPS1 movies are known to be for adult watchers and same goes for video games. Music they play on the radio is censored of all the foul language, so they make an effort. That leaves people the choice to watch, listen, or read the things they want, and they have to know beforehand that it might offend them. Although sometimes people think censoring those media aspects is not enough censorship, that's about all that can be done to not offend others. By taking everything off the shelves because of people's opinions, it could potentially make someone else angry or them being lacked of the things they want to read or watch. Censorship can be wholesome without removing all media off the shelves and in the world",4,4
3097,"I @CAPS1 would like @CAPS4 if nothing was censored, but I don't matter, right? I am the kid that has no choice in the matter. @CAPS3 should I not care about what I am forced not to see? I am sure there are alot of parents that dont follow the censorship rules. Like buying a rated '@CAPS2' movie, or game for their kid that is @NUM1, and not @NUM2 years old, but @CAPS4 does matter that the parents are following the law. I say shrew the law, because when @CAPS4 comes down to @CAPS4, its the parents right to tell/show there kid about things, not the goverment.      I Think that @CAPS5 have never really had a choice in matters that affects them directly, and I think we should. @CAPS5 have to follow what ever rules untill there @NUM2 years of age: @CAPS3? I wish I knew @CAPS3, but I dont. Because there is no logical reason for @CAPS5 not to have a vote on what affects them.           For all I know there could be a law out right now that is going to make my generation less powerfull then the last generation. I am not saying that this is true, I am only saying that its possible for some thing like this to happen.     Video games, They are my weakness I admit, but I don't see a reason for games to be censored. When people say things like '@CAPS5 who play video games with violence will make them murders.' @CAPS4 makes me frustrated. There is not one single thing that proves that.      I have known @CAPS5 who have been censored all there life, and when they learn about @CAPS4 all they cant even handle @CAPS4. Its sad really to not beable to watch the news and learn what is going on in the world. Just because they have been kept away from all that all there life.     I don't know how or where they get this censorship idea from in the first place. Did their parents tell them @CAPS4 was bad, and never watch/read @CAPS4? Where did they hear @CAPS4 from? I beleive @CAPS4 came from the media @CAPS4 self. I can see the headlines now, '@CAPS5 watching @CAPS6 movie cause them to be murders.' Then they would have some made up percentage on how manny @CAPS5 turn in to a murder that watch @CAPS6 movie compare to @CAPS5 that don't.

If an adult does not like a kid book because its giving the kid the wrong idea then do not get the book for the kid.

3136,"Have you ever watched or seen a book or even a movie that you do not think kids should be reading or watching? I have, heard of many books. There are even music out there that only adults should be listening too. There are some parents that are strick on what their kids watch, hear, read or sing. I know for a fact that my parents would not want me to be letting my childern read, watch or hear that kind of stuff.      When you think of the music, books, or movies that need to be out of childern reach what should they be? I think the movies, books and even music that have bad language, violence, and bullying need to be hidden from childern. Bad language is not apporaite from kids to be hearing when they are under the age of ten or even older. When you hear a bad song coming on when you have little kids near you, you should turn the station to a differnet station. If little kids hear this kind of language they well be saying it when the are young.     Another book, song or music that should be taken off the shelf should be ones that have violence. If kids watch, hear or read about violence, they are most likely to start being violent when they start hearing or reading about it. When you are walking around you, you should not be scared to walk by yourself with out getting attacked. If you see someone reading or watcing something that you do not think is right for them you should tell them not to be reading or watching that. Violence is bad for little kids to be doing when they are young.     Books, movies or music about bullying should be taken out of. Bullying is not the answer to everything, even though many think it is it is not. If you think it is good for little kids to be learning about bullying you are wrong! It is a bad thing for little kids. Bullying also gets you in trouble when you are caught doing the bullying.      Have you ever thought of a book that should be taken off the shelf? The books that I think that should be taken off the shelf would be the ones that have bad language, violence, and bullying. Childern should not be hearing or reading about bad language. They also should not be watcing anything about violence. Lastly they should not be reading anything about bullying",4,4
3013,"A book represents a person's beliefs and feelngs about a topic. Therefore censoring books is wrong because it goes against freedom of speech. I do not believe books, or other media should be removed because while it @MONTH1 be offensive, if it is the truth about something then we need to read about it to prevent tragedies from happening again. A person who finds a topic offensive isn't forced to read about it. If we do not accept other people beliefs, we are just as prejudice as the books we are trying to censor.      Many books that are threatened by censorship are books about historical facts, such as the holocaust. I think we have the right to know about important events. For one reason, if we forget about such things, than they are more likely to be repeated. Do we really want the murder of millions of people to be repeated? Just becaused we are ashamed of something dosen't mean we should sweep it under the carpet where it can lay hidden waiting to stike again like a hungry alligator. Instead books about prejudice events should be kept out to show an example of how we shouldn't act.     While some books are censored because of shame, some are censored because a certain group of people @MONTH1 find it offensive. There is a much easier solution that censoring those books. The offended groups should just ignore the book. If it is offensive in the first place then no one should be forced to read it. The book shouldn't be forced in any other way like posters, and television broadcast. It should be kept in a certain section of a library so parties wishing to avoid it can.     The main reason for a book to be censored in the first place is because someone finds in offensive. However, isn't keeping someone from saying something just as offensive? To @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 is a big target for censorship, but it is about treating everyone fairly. If that book like that was censored, it would be like saying some people are better than others. Another big target for censorship in some countries is the @CAPS3. Censoring that book would basically tell the @CAPS4 population that they are wrong.     Censoring something is wrong. Not only could it cause sad events to repeat themselves, offended parties can just simply avoid the book. While some books offend people, censoring a book can be just as offensive to other parties. The simplest thing to do is to leave it up to the reader to decid if they should read it, or not.",4,4
3382,"There are people in the world who might be offended by various types of literature, movies, music, or etcetera. I understand this, but I don't think they should be banned just because someone else doesn't agree with it. Other people might like it or they might like it themselves if they give a chance.     Before you go saying that you don't like something maybe you should give a chance. Maybe try looking at a a few pages of a book you once heard about. Watch at least one or two episodes of television show. Before you make an ultimate decision about something, give it a chance first.     Some people don't some media because it goes against their beliefs. If this is the case then just ignore it. If you don't like certain type of music don't listen to it. Maybe it is a movie your not particularly fond of then don't watch it.      In conclusion, people should learn to give some things a chance. They should also shouldn't get rid of something just because they themselves aren't fond of it or find it offensive. That said, I don't believe that certain media should be banned.",4,3
4147,"Should certaine materials on shelves that are offensive be removed from shelves? I believe that certaine materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that are offensive to people should not be removed from shelves. These materials are taken in perspective by all different kinds of people.     Offensive materials should not be taken off of shelves because something that is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be offensive to another person. People take things differently than other people might. For example, a lady might find a book to be disturbimg or offensive, while the man next to her can find that same book interesting and useful to him. Not one person is the same so not everybody will take offense to the same thing.     I also believe that if someone does not like the object that they are offended by then they do not have to look, purchase, or give attention to that object that is there on the shelve. He or she is not forced to buy, read, or watch what is offending them. The material that is offending that person is not purposley put there to offend them, it is there for people who are interested in it so that they can enjoy theresleves in whatever it is that they might be doing.     Therefore I do not think that materials that are offensive should be taken off of shelves. People have the right to things that they enjoy. A material should not be taken off of a shelve just because one person is offended by it. Different people have their own perspective of things and opinion of how things.",4,4
3935,"Leave @CAPS1 on the Shelves                                             In every library it is intitle to have all types of books, movies, and magazines.Even if they are good or bad. Not everyone in this world is going to have the same likings.If there are people that are offened of what types of sources they find in the library I don't think it should be taken off of the shelves. Everyone in able to agree or disagree in what types of things they like.      If the library didn't how would people learn about things today that are going on in this world, because not everything that is said on television is true. Every library in the world should not take certian books, movies, and magazines down just so kids or anyone else can't read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1 because there might be other people who would like to read @CAPS1 or watch @CAPS1. If the libraries took down certain books, movies, and magazines then it shouldn't even be called a library because it is suppose to have all types of sources.     Not everyone is going to have the same opinion on whether or not certain books,movies, or magazines should be in the library, but all types of these sources should stay in the library beacuse if they are offensive to some people there aren't going to be like that for everyone so that wouldnt't be fair for the other people who enjoy reading, looking at magazines to see whats new ,or watching all different types of moive, and listening to music.     I think that the librarians should not take anything down in their libraries because they know what they are doing when they put those sources on the shelves and also they should stay on the shelves because if they didn't want people to feel offended then they wouldn't have made books, moive, or magazine that would offend people today.     Libraries don't leave the sources on the shelves on perpose for people to feel offended, they leave @CAPS1 for other people to read.With this being said all types or books, magazines, or movies should be left on the shelves to help other people learn what they want to learn about",3,3
4431,Everyone has books that they do not like or do not approve of.  What if one of your children came home from a library with one of those books?          My view on censorship in a library is that if you don't like it then don't read it.  I think they should have a childrens section and an adult section in the library so you won't have to worry about the problem.  If a child wants a book from the adult section then he or she would need to have a parent with them.  That way the kid wouldn't bring home any books that there parent wouldn't approve of or allow them read.     If you are an adult and you don't like a book then simply just don't read it.  Maybe other readers like the book and don't want it taken off of the shelf.  They wouldn't be able to say that the reason they want it off of the shelf is because they don't want there children to see it because there children would need there permission to check out the book anyways.     I think this way would be much easier for all readers to enjoy the library and they would not have to worry about picking out a book they don't like or there parents would not approve of,3,3
4213,"Culture and history are two very important aspects of the world. Liraries are placs that house these very things for the enjoyment of all who visit them. This is why i believe libraries should not censor any of their materials. Learning has always been and will be a key aspect of living and libraies offer this to people freely! How can one take that freedom away from another?    Not all things in the world and history are perfect and have occured in the ideal way. However, subjects such as slavery, the @CAPS1, and other controversial topics must be known about. These horrible happenings @MONTH1 offend some but they cannot be erased from the past. Learning is natural to humans yet we always try to fight it. It is not right to hide the truth.    Some people are easily offended and some are not. But the true question is,'who is to say what is offensive?'. There are people who believe that discussing @CAPS2 in the christian religion is offnsive and others who believe any type of homosexuality is also. Yet there are still others whose believes directly contradict these. Libraries must maintain all types of material becuase their purpose is to hold knowledge and not just what people want to know.    How can we make better decisions in the future if we do not recognize what has occured in the past? Removing information from the library because it is offensive is essentially depriving people solutions to problems. All aspects of culture and history should be preserved so that we can know where we came from, the mistakes we made, and how we plan to fix our new ones! History has never been in the control of man.    In conclusion, libraries should not censor any of their materials. What has happened in the past cannot be changed or altered to fit our ideal visions. And by doing this we deprive future generations of information that could potentially be useful. We must never forget who we are as a people, and where we came from. Our knowledge and ability to learn is our greatest asset and must be treasured.",4,4
4404,"Tuff @CAPS1 for a little @CAPS2      Censorship is a problem we are faced with today. I believe there are certain instances where censorship is necessary, but I also feel it must be kept in check. Thats why i have a great deal of reespect for organizations and industries that try and stop or put of censorship media untill your more mature and responsible enough to handle it.         The most common categories where censorship is not all right in my world are, books and music. A lot of book are very well writen and fabulous to read, but in history or racial, and more cultural books they use words/terms that are offensive to me and a lot of other people to.      Also, the main cause in thius is music. In today's society, nearly every person has an ipod and downloaded onto that ipod is music. Im not saying all music is terribly bad, but in most cases i hear about every word in the book and race topics. Rappers are setting bad examples for young adolecents like myself, who pose with guns and have marijuna and crack. Why do they do this? Just to mkae themselves more popular. That is hurting our education and making us think we shyould be criminals.      I in my opinion enjoy magazines and tru informative facts from professional reporters. Tghe reporters are on the citizens side and trying to get the true facts out there for us the people. Maqgazines also, tell about annual celbrations and good things happening in the world. Whyere you can find out the scores of sports game and what the weather is going to be like.      Last year, i remeber reading 'To @CAPS3 a @CAPS4'. It was so contraversial and talked about blackl slaves and whites treatinbg them like dirt. Also, about black never win a trial and there treated unfairly. I felt embaressed and i was the only african american in the class. It was akward. I felt like if we had a discussion people would talk badly about iot then remember i was in the room then theyd stop.     What is the world going to do? Censorship covers an entire multi media spectrum of what is bad and good censorship. It is up to the right people to stand up for what is right and wrong for your children and young adolecents in the world. To help fight this cause! Bring down all that is bad! We can do it, we will fight! Like @PERSON1 says, 'dont hope for a better change or wish for a new world.' If you want change you need to make it happen and stand up for whats right and make a differnce in the world",4,4
3452,"Do you think that certain books should not be shared with certain poeple? In all honesty yes, let them read and listen to whatever they think is interesting. No matter what the content that the book or @CAPS1 contains it's their choice, there is a power called freedom in this world. One might think that if you are able to read and comprehend the words that are wrote in that book or sang in a song, then yes read and listen to anything you want.     If a young person such as a kindergartener picks up a book about sex you know there is no way that child will be able to comprehend it. So yes any books should be left on the shelf at libraries, open to anyone and everyone who are willing to read them. Its not that you have to be mature enough to read a book its that you have to understand it and are able to read to get what the book is trying to say. Yes some things parents don't want their children to know, but this world is filled with awful things and they are bound to figure some of those horrible things out sooner or later. Reading and music lets you learn and experience different situations that you might have never been in before. Both books and songs are a way to express yourself and everyone should express theirself in some way.     When it comes to movies that's a different story. Those movies are rated for a reason. On a rated @CAPS2 film i could see @NUM1 year olds on up watching it, because by then those kids have been in high school and everything sexual and perverted have been put into their little heads. Also most have been in sex education class. Blood and all things cruel have been talked about and heard about too. So yes let @NUM1 year olds on up watch rated @CAPS2 films. The one thing that isn't suggested is taking a little kid to see a film that isn't rated for them. Say a parent took a @NUM3 year old to see a scarry movie, more than likely that child is going to be scared and scarred from see blood, stabbing, and sexual content.    Movies should be left rated for whom they should be rated for. When it comes to music and books, they are wonderful learning tools also good for expression of ones self. So learn, experience, and express. No matter what your interested in freedom was gave to you so use it",3,4
3485,"I do not believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from shelves. Wherever you go in the world, whether you like it or not, your going to come in contact with things you don't find appropriate or you think are offensive. @TIME1 world is far from perfect. One reason i don't belive they should be removed is because it would be unconstitutional. The freedon of speech and the press was not ment to be tampered with. If a specific library thinks their articles are innapropriate, an easy solution would be to put these articles in a certain section of the library and warn people what they are.     The main reason I don't believe books, music, and magazines should be removed from the shelves is becuase the world is a nasty place and books are the least of your concerns. Kids can't be sheltered their whole lifes, they need to face reality and books are a good source of that. Kids these days are resiliant and can handle 'innapropriate' content. Parents need to face the fact that their kids are going to be exposed to offensive things in @TIME1 imperfect world of ours. It's just a natural part of growing up.     Another contributing factor is that it would be unconstitutional to remove books and other articles from the shelves of @LOCATION1's libraries. When the amendments freedom of speech and press were written down they were intended to stay there. They are not guidlines that can be looked over, they are rules set in stone for @TIME1 great country. People to @TIME1 for freedom over much bigger issues than books. Who are we to tell people what they can and can't write down. People's natural opinions can't and shouldn't be governed. I think it would be a crime against @LOCATION1 to censor things in libraries.     My final reason for not censoring libraries is that it all boils down to the people running the library. If they think some of their articles are profound and innapropriate, meerly isolate them to a certain section of the library and put a warning for people to see. If people don't want to be offended they simply have to just stay away from these sections. Take responsibilty for what is in these libraries that is apparently so offending and put them in their own area and stay away from them, do not take them out completely, because who knows someone @MONTH1 want that offending book.     These are all supporting opinions why I personally do not belive libraries should be censored. @TIME1 world is far from perfect and it's not going to become perfect by censoring libraries. Plus @TIME1 act would be completely unconstitutional. Finally all the libraries have to do is exile these articles to certain areas of the libraries and slap a warning on them. If libraries were censored there would be a lot of missing information in @TIME1 world because there are many things in @TIME1 world that are 'offensive' to atleast someone",4,4
3029,wow thats racist. as i said when i saw the movi white men cant jump. yes that movie could have afended me a lot but it didnt personaly i thought it was funny i enjoyed it cuase its true statistics say black people can jump higher then white people. its all on how you look at it you have to have a sense of humor when it comes to stuff like that.      everyone remembers sometime when someone said something offensive to them. but its your choice to take that to heart or just laugh about it. life is so much easyer when u dont cry over every little thing that someone said to you. see now i have a since of humor. when i was in that movie i was laughing so hard i almost peed myself. i didnt care that it singled out white people so what its funny.     to kill a mochinburd was also a book that a lot of people called offensive and i can see why. it had the @CAPS1 word in there a lot. but back then it was a different time the people in the book werent saying it to you so why would you be offended by it. he wasnt offending you.      if you take little things like that to your heart then you will have a tough time going through life. somethings you just have to let go and roll off your body.     in conclusion yes we have had a lot of offending stuff said to us but you cant let it get you down so much you have to move on. and if you move on you will be a better person in the long run.,3,3
4463,"Censorship is just another way to take knowledge from another person or a society. Wanting to take and hide even the smallest of discreet history, politic corruption, and inappropriate sights to a generation can turn them all ignorant and unaware of their past, present, and possibly future.                 Censorship is extremely dangerous to a soceity because it leaves them vulnerable to the future. For example, if people tried to censor @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and many other environmentalist around the globe of the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 possibility, then the world would not be able to have the chance to stop or at least slow the upcoming disaster by going green. Instead, we would most likely die a few hundred years before that deadline. Also, maybe if more people knew about @PERSON2's censorship of his oil distribution among the @LOCATION2 (during his presidency) people might have at least discussed of impeachment.                                                                            Try to think how the future would have been if racism, terrorism, wars, or even an event like the holocaust were censored. That could be taken as brainwashing! Even though that @MONTH1 cause peace and happiness around the world, we still would know nothing of our history leaving us historically, unintellilectual. Then think of all the sudden problem it would cause if that information was suddenly found. In the book series of 'The @CAPS5' by @PERSON1, a city has been isolated from their past, who they call 'the @CAPS6', and they are basically brainwashed to think that they almost destroyed the world by war and destruction by the new government and their new technology.     Luckily, in our own era I do not believe we are censored from most things except of course politics going on between other countries. For example, the @LOCATION1 bin @CAPS7 killing was nothing of anyones awareness except the @CAPS8 of @ORGANIZATION1, military, and @CAPS9. That was a thoughtful choice from @CAPS10 as well instead of announcing it on @NUM1 news. I'd rather of coursebe notified about my history, because it's interesting and it shows why things are now. Books like 'To @CAPS11 a @CAPS12' or '@PERSON3' should never be taken off shelves for young pupils or old matures. Although it would seem a bit more offensive to hearing a historical racist cocasian singing about negroes than a racist book, I would always be interested in hearing about it.     Censorship should definitely be illegal itself in libraries, @CAPS13 stores, and any other selling stores of books, music, movies, and/or magazines. Although, I have not heard of any recent censorships, but then again should I not be able to? It is censorship..",4,4
3038,"Books that are offensive should not be taken off the shelf all together, but should be put in a section made for adult readers only.  This way no children would see the book anyway.       If an offensive book is in a school or any other place that the readers are children for the majority than it should be ok to take that book off of the shelf.     All together it should be ok to remove an offensive book from a shelf but only if the book is offencive to the wrong audience.",2,2
3979,"Kids today have a whole lot of options of books they can or cannot read in the schools library. The things they cannot read are censored. School systems have good reasons why they censor some book, and I agree with the cooperation. The facts on why books are censored in a school campus is to much racil slurs, profanity, and unaproperit situations.     How many schools have books that have racism in it. Racism happens in books all the time. In fact one out of fifty books contain racism. The big book is '@PERSON1' fin by @PERSON2. It recently got banned from schools all over the @LOCATION1.     People all around the world are trying to teach their kids what to say and what not to say. Kids pick up some bad language from the books they read. Even though some of these books still lay on the shelves of the schools. It is up to the kids not to read them.     Uniproperit situations is why schools only order some sports illustrated magazines. The school librarians don't want the kids looking at any nudity or violent scences in the books. Do you say to blame them?     I believe that the schools and parents are doing the right things. It is up to the kids to make the decision to listen or not listen to their parents. I believe censorship is a great thing for @CAPS1 youth.",3,3
3675,"Your watching a movie on tv that you and your friend have seen in theatres. You both love the movie and just as it gets close to the best part, the tv skips over that part because people think that that sceen is inapropiate. Censorship is good, but sometimes it is too strick when it comes to movies, music, and books.     Some of the movies that are popular will end up on tv for the viewers entertainment, @CAPS1 some movies have sceens that are a little inapropriate, and even though it's not that offensive, the tv compaies will cut that sceen out of it. Also, if there is bad language in the movie, they will take that word out and replace it with another word that makes no sense with what the movie is trying to say. Censorship tends to ruin the movies that most people love. The tv companies even censor historical movies. If its a historical movie, it shouldn't be censored because it takes away from the true story.     Music is another item that tends to get censored quite often. With music, if there is a bad word, the word is just skipped over or bleeped out which makes the song sound strange. Most songs are censored because parents don't want their children to listen to it. I don't think music should be censored just for little kids. If the parents don't want their children to hear those words, they shouldn't let their children listen to that kind of music.     Book tend to be censored and even banned at schools. Not too many childrens read books anymore so if they do decide to read a book, we should let them read what they want besause reading helps the mind. Some schools banned books becuse of inapropiate language. That is unfair because some books are beautifully written, but children can't read them because of language. Also, some books are censored because they are too detailed when it comes to certain scenes dealing with sex and crime. Some books are just too good to be banned.     A lot of theings seem to be censored in this world. We should have censorship, but it shouldn't be so stricked when it comes to movies, music, and books.",3,3
3727,"Do I believe that ceertain materials, such as books, music, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive? NO, the reason I say that is because if it was offensive to me,they might not be offensive to other people. Im not saying things like that are offensive to me because there not. I personaly love reading books like comic books with super heros in them. That excites me.     Back to the point if people thinks a book is offensive to them then they don'@CAPS1 need to pick it up! If I knew a book would be offensive to me I would never pick it up. I know what your going to say 'but what if they didn'@CAPS1 know it was going to be offensive to them'. Well thats a gud question. Just put it up and dont complain because the writer didn'@CAPS1 know you were gonig to take it offensive or the wrong way. They were just writing a book.           It's not the writers fault. He or she was just probable writing a book that they though was a good book. When it got published and you read it and you took it offensive. DON'@CAPS1 because they exspecing there self's. So dont take no book's off the shelf's in the libraries because stupid people wont to get mad  beacause they took it offensive. Your going to ruin it for the other people that though the book was either a good book or an azsome book.     So now that we got that out of the way lets move on and get on with our life's.

4224,"People go to the library to find certain types of material. Some people get offended by some of the material and feel that it should be removed. Certain materials should not be removed if found offensive to others because it might not be offensive to someone else that might enjoy it. The offensive material can be history that the world need to know, such as racism. If they did not know the importance of slavery they wouldn't know of the past life and why we are treated the way we are being treated. History is a big part of life that everyone one should know. That's why we have history class to let us know of the history that we've been through.     All material don't have to be history that is offensive. Some material have sex and violence that is offensive. The libraries should have labels on every section to let people know what type of material it is. If people know what type of material it is and still choose to view it then they get what they ask for. It shouldn't be removed because they didn't like it. I learned in history class about wars that had violence in them that some of my classmates didn't like but that's what happened and we needed to know.     Materials are made for a reason. They should not be removed if found offensive to someone but not offensive to another. I read books in school with all kinds of violence and other things people @MONTH1 not like but it's history. History makes a difference in our lives and it's what we need. You can not removed that. If you find it offensive just don't view that material again.",3,3
3324,"Libraries should have censorship because young kids could come and open and look at it. I think we should have it because it would make sure the kids wont look at them. There are three reasons why they should have censorship. First they can teach kids bad things, second bad influence, and third they just dont need to be there.     First was they can teach kids bad thing. That is because they would start looking at it more. Then they would get in trouble. There is really no reason for them to looking at it at all.     Second, its a bad influence. They go and tell and show there friends and make them start doing stuff that isn't right. Makeing then do stuff and then have a bad future.     Third there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it. Like unless it fell from a book case and was laying on the floor. But there really isn't no reason they should be looking at it.     I think we should have it so it cant hurt and kids so everyone would be right in life",3,3
3254,"Censorship, or the removing of material deemed inappropriate or offensive, has been used as a means of controlling people's thoughts and feelings for many centuries. The @CAPS1 used it in the @CAPS2 colonies during the @CAPS2 @CAPS4 to keep the colonists loyal to the crown. The @CAPS5 used censorship not just during the @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @CAPS8 as a brand of propaganda, but also during @CAPS7 @CAPS8 @CAPS11 under @CAPS12 guidance. Censorship is still in use in the @LOCATION1 today, as a way to 'protect the children'. The @ORGANIZATION1 tells the @CAPS2 public what we can and cannot watch on television and what we can and cannot listen to on the radio. Other organizations tell us what books we can and cannot read, what video games we can and cannot play, and what items we can and cannot buy. Such organizations, I believe, are pushing the @LOCATION1 @LOCATION1 and other freedom-loving nations to the edge of totalitarianism.     As Katherine Paterson stated, 'If I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else.' If one person has the right to control what we buy, what we listen to, and what we see, then how come we don't have that right to control the same things for them? Where do we draw the line? Eventually, all books, movies, magazines, music, and video games would be deemed offensive and inappropriate. Culture would slowly wither and die, and our lives would become drab and essentially useless, for lack of a better term.     I recently read a book titled '@CAPS14', by @PERSON2, about two periods in a boy's life: his childhood with his family in tribal @LOCATION2, and the life he had after his mother's death in the @CAPS15 capital of @LOCATION3. @PERSON2's work includes some passages that are less than angelic, and, had strict censorship been in place, these passages would have caused the book to go unpublished. @PERSON2's work gave not only myself but a multitude of others insight into the life that @CAPS16 face in the changing landscape of their @CAPS7, and it certainly made me realize once again that I have a life rich in family, friends, and comfort.     All in all, censorship is a horrid disease that slowly infects and consumes every part of our lives. If you get to censor something you find offensive, then why don't I do the same thing? Some censorship is good, and a fact of life. But we have to ask ourselves, where do we draw the line? Where's the boundary between safety and and outright police state? Censorship is just a fancy term for blatant disregard of the @CAPS17, as freedom of speech is guaranteed for all @CAPS2 citizens. As a famous colonial revolutionary once said, '@CAPS19 me liberty, or @CAPS19 me death!' If censorship continues to grow and our libraries grow emptier and emptier, then I shall take death over liberty, for liberty with censorship is no liberty at all.",5,5
3781,"Removing literature from a shelf should not be permitted just because you think something about it. Everyone has different ideas and opinions about what is appropriate and what is not appropriate. If you don't like a certain book or you do not want your children reading that book then don't take them to the library in the first place.     In a public library you have to be old enough to buy a library card to check out a book, so if you are old enough to have a library card then obviously you arent going to find a book that is innapropriate for your own age. You @MONTH1 find a book that is immature to you, but you do not have to read it. Men and women go to public libraries to learn. If you want to learn about something that is offensive, then you won't beable to if one person comes along and doesn't approve of the book. Is that fair? You tell me.     In a school library yes there should be a limit to what children can and cannot read. In a junior high school the standards should be different compared to an elementary or a senior high school. In an elementary children are required to read as part of their academics, but they are not old enough to want to learn about something offensive, therefore they will not need those types of books in their library. In a junior high school there should be a limit on the offensiveness but the students still have a right to know what is going on arond them. In a senior high school students should have a right to read whatever type of book they please.     Magazines are a different subject. Alot of times in magazines there are advertisements for smoking products or alchoholic beverages. Those types of magazines should not beable to be read in a school library. In a public library a person should have the right to read whatever he or she pleases.      In the end im saying adults and teens have a right to learn about whatever they like, but children should be young and innocent while they can. You cannot keep them shielded from commercials and people advertising these things themselves, but what you can prevent you should. Nobody wants their children growing up too fast, but do not limit their growth.",4,4
3393,"Should certain materials be removed from your public library? Not everyone has the same views as eachother. What might be offenses to you, @MONTH1 be enjoyable to someone else.      I personally don't believe that anything should be removed from a library, just because something you might not like someone could really enjoy. If you don't want to learn about something you shouldn't take that away from others who do.      I think that if they do start removing things from library shelves they should still be allowed to be viewed to those who want to. Even if you just put them away would be better than taking them out of the library completely.      More and more books are banned everyday, and I personally don't think that's fair to the growing generation who don't get to enjoy the things the old generation have.      So I believe that no books should be removed from library's. If you don't believe or enjoy something doesn't mean someone else wont",3,3
4114,"Everyone in the world has different opinions. Some people care about things that other people don't care about at all. One topic that seems to get everyone going is censorship. Everyone has an opinion on it; and not everyone agrees with eachother.     All libraries have different sections based upon age. There are childrens sections, teens sections, and adult sections. I think censorship has a lot to do with maturity levels. Things in books and movies that aren't appropriate for children, shouldn't be put in the children section. I understand parents' don't want their children reading or watching abscene material; but as kids are growing up, they're going to learn about the innapropriate things sooner or later in school.      I don't think anything should be taken off of a shelf just because a handful of parents find the material offensive. I don't take censorship very seriously. Some parents want their children reading books with innapropriate material so they can learn about what goes on in the world and what life is like. Most children and some teens don't know what the world is like because they don't get out much. They don't learn things that they should know already. Reading is a way of learning. When someone wants to know more information about any place or anything, they go to the library and check out a book. For a school project or just for fun.      Most parents agree that nothing innappropriate should be in a childrens' section at a library. Just because they're young and parents don't want their kids going around at the age of @NUM1 cussing like a sailor. But I think that teens are mature enough to read or watch innappropriate material like a book with cussing or a movie with kissing scenes. Parents shouldn't have a say on what goes on or off the shelves in a library. They should just mind their own business. If their kid picks out a book that they think is too offensive for them to read, then they can just simply tell them that they cannot get the book. It's as simple as that. Parents who ask for books to get taken off the shelf are just asking for too much.      Censorship in libraries is not a big deal to me. I think kids should be able to read a book that they want to read. At least they're wanting to read. Let them read for @PERSON1's sake. But like I said, everyone has their own opinions.",4,4
3146,Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion no I don't think that any books should be banned from a public libaray.     The authors of books have freedom of speech so yeah some books @MONTH1 offend people but if it offends them they should try stay away from that books or magazines. I think that if certain books get banned from the libaray then you won't be able to buy them in stores anymore because the stores will banned them as well.     In my personal opinion no I don't think that any book should be banned from the public library. The reason being is because you can't judge a book by it's cover. You don't know if the book is goin to offend you until you read it. After you read it or you'r in the middle of reading it and it offends you you should take it back to the library and get a new one.     Should certain books be banned or shouldn't certain books be banned? In my own personal opinion no I don't think that books should be banned from the public library. Because alot of books that do offend people are the one's that teach us about history.,3,3
4743,"Everyone has a preference in works of literature, such as books, magazines, movies or music. Different types of these works of literature are significant to each person. If everyone had the right to completely remove one piece of work that displeases them, then no works would remain. Therefore, I believe no materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should be removed from public libraries or other public places. Everyone has unique ideas, necesities and preferences.     A few years ago, I had a classmate who had different ideas from a myriad of people on religious persecution. He hated the idea of mixing people of different religions into one place. He wrote a paper containing all of his ideas on how the world should function in terms of religion. He tried to publish it, but did not succeed because his work was considered offensive. Even though I disagree with his ideas, I do not think his work should have been rejected. There could have been people in the world who did agree with his thoughts and would have been interested to read them. There could even have been ideas in his paper that could've helped countries solve various problems. I believe it is unfair that his paper was rejected.     People have different necesities based on what they have to accomplish. For example, I was reading a book last @DATE1 about a girl who was doing a project on racism. She went to the library to search for a book about apartheid in @LOCATION1 but couldn't find anything. She asked a librarian if there were any, but the librarian told her that books such as those were considered offensive in that local library and she would have to search elsewhere. I believe that it is unjust because the girl @MONTH1 not have had anywhere else to go to get the information about her project. She should've had the right to access the information that she needed for the project to prevent her from failing.     Another reason that no books should be removed is simply because everyone has unique preferences. In the world, there are books that certain people would enjoy more than others. Literature should be abled to be used for the purpose of entertainment and convenience. If I were to go to a library now, I would find many selections that correspond to my ideal novel or magazine. Every person should have that right. If people start removing materials that are offensive to them, then nothing on the shelves would remain and not one person would have the right to have access to the materials they desire.     In this world, diversity exists everywhere. People have and always will want, need and desire different things. Works of literature are just one of them. If people begin to eliminate offensive materials based on everyone's frustration or displeasures, then no books will remain on the public shelves. Therefore, materials such as books, music, movies and magazines should never be removed from public places. These things are necessities to the world.",4,4
4164,I go to the libbrary every @DATE1 of every week. Although I don't really read that much. I usualy get movies or music. If I do get a book to read its usualy a magazine or something for school.     I don't think that books should be removed. If you don't read them it doesent mean that other people don't. If you don't like the book just ignore it and go on its simple as that. For instens if I found a book about @CAPS1 or about the @CAPS2 fathe I would not read it for my self but I would not take it down off of the shelf. Other people might want to read it. It's there choice to read it not mine.     It's like the radio know. The radio plays songs and cuts out the curis words. I don't think that they should do that because it messies up the songs lyrics and it is going aginst the artists words. The artist sings the song but people chang his or her words. To me I don't think thats right. It's also like telivtion now. You see the movie in theaters or on @CAPS3 and they have bad language or bad seens in them. When you watch that same movie on telivtion they take out about @NUM1 minuts of the movie because of th bad seen or they cut out the languge.     To me I think every thing should stay. I think if you don't want your kids to see it just block it but don't cut out parts from the movie it's not fair to the other people. If people don't like some music then just swich the radio station to another area on the radio. Theres no need to take the words out. Kids are going to pick the words up in school or off the streets any way. I also think seence we are having to pay so much taxes I think we should get the privilage to come home and watch movies on telivtion and relax,3,3
4748,"No, materials should not be removed from the libraries.First most of books,movies and,music are the best way to support difffernt things.They all have there type of way of convinicing you.There are many different ways to understand but those are certainly the best ways.                          Like a movie some people like to see things to understand them.Because it take times for some people to see instead of reading or listening.It take people to just seat and watch is a great way.Some people that look at a movie an a wrong way get the wrong type of thought about something which make it offensive to them.                                                                    Like music is a great way to understand what someone is trying to say or get across.You have to take time out to really listen and here what they are taking about.If you here a song once and then you just take it a wrong way u never let your mind here what they said.Some people let one word or two make u think differnt about the song.So before u judge listen to the whole song.     A book one of the worlds best way to understand were someone is comeing from.A book is like a short life.If judge a book bye its first couple paragraphs you would never get a meaning out of it.With a book you have to give it a chance to seek in your mind so that you do get an understanding.A book can tell u alot of things.So some people take it offensive.     These types of materials should never be removed from labraries.This things are great ways to understand things.So if you take one thing offensive try another way maybe its a better way for people to understand it.Without this materials we would never understond,discovery anythong in are worl",2,3
3717,"Should books, music, etc; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well people have the right to look at what they want, to hear what they want. Some think its not right to have offensive things out in the open on the shelves.Some people think its alright. I gusse it all just depends on that person and thier feelings.      Lets say i was in the library and i did see  something offensive. well the world does not stop and say ''hey look at that @ORGANIZATION1 finds that offensive so lets take that off the shelves just to please her''.  Am sorry but thats not how life works. If you dont like looking at it then turn the  other way. If it were me i would be worried about more important things such as war or things going  on in my life other then something offensive on the book shelves.     Its a big world out there and it is not getting any smaller and it is not going anywhere anytime soon. There are going to be things in life we the people dont like to look at, to maybe hear thats offensive. Heres what i say to it, get over it .          The other  day i was at the bait shop and i heared a word that  i dare not to even  say and i hate hearing that word. What was i going to do tell a grown man to not say that?...... I just  rolled my eyes and went on about my  buisness.          Should books, music, ect; be removed from shelves if they are found offensive? well like ive  been saying this whole time, in live there are going to be certain things that are offensive to you. You have to get over it . Sometimes geting over offensive things that you see are not easy but hey lifes not  easy",3,3
3173,"Bad @CAPS1 in @DATE1's @CAPS2      Libraries are a great place to learn about many thing, from earths history to where will we be in the future. I think somethings should not be on the shelves of a library because some books can be found very offensive to some people. Even movies and music can be offensive to some people. I think the music of @DATE1 is a big problem because the lyrics can be very offensive. Movies are not a huge issue but they can be at times.      There are many reasons movies can be offensive. If they are offensive why put them in the libraries? Well the libraries just want to make money so they do not care about offensive products. For example a @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movie that is inaccurrate and poorly made might be offensive to real life @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 veterans. The veterans then might want the movie taken of the shelves. I have seen some great @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 movies but I have also see some bad ones too. My grandpa was a veteran and he saw a bad @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5 and got so upset he cursed at the @CAPS15 and almost threw the remote at it.      Then ther is the problem with the music of @DATE1. I do not think stores including libraries should sell albums of @DATE1's rap artists because all the talk about is drugs, sex, and girls. If you ask me its stupid. But when you start selling them in a library there is something wrong with that librariy. Some country singers can be like that to because all the sing about is getting drunk then having sex. I just think the most of the music of @DATE1 is really pointless and a waste of time because when I listen to it I think this is stupid and makes no sinces.     Books can be offensive sometimes it just depends on the writer. Books with a lot of cursing can be offensive to religions groups who are forbidden to curse or read curse words. Why put it on the shelves of libraries then? Well it all lead back to money. If people buy the books that mean the libraries get money and the more books people buy the richer the libraries becomes. I read a book that was about some one killing cats and I found that offensive because I love cats I would never hurt them. I got really mad when I read it so I threw it down the took it to the library and complained to them.     So over all the libraries should be more carefull on what they put on the shelves for people to buy. If the libraries but the wrong things on the shelves they might end up in a law suit. But if they do not put offensive things on the shelves they will not end up being in a law suit",3,3
3627,"I belive that the view on censorship in libraries are fine as they are for many reasons. The main reasons that i belive censorship in libraries are fine are that almost everything in the library are for people to learn about weather they read it or watch a movie about it. Another reason is that if they took everything that was offecsive or unliked then there would be a lot less information for people to learn about in libraries.     I agree with Katherine Paterson in her quote because it means that if we took away every book that someone found offensive then there would be no books left. Every person has different things that offend them and it would not be possible to remove everything from the library that offended someone. For example, if someone wanted to learn about a historic war from the past, but if someone was offended by the war because they lost a family member or friend to it, should the piece of writing be taken away? Libraries are a place that someone can go to, to learn about something. They hold a lot of information about many different subjects that people go to learn about even if it @MONTH1 be offensive to some people. If someone doesn't like something or finds it offensive then they should just leave it on the shelf and move on because someone else might learn something important from it. There are things in life that people need to be opened to or informed about even though they @MONTH1 not always be plesent. Libraries are the place that people get introduced to these things and if these things are removed then where will people go to be informed about this information.     To sum it all up, yes there are things in libraries that some people @MONTH1 find offensive but other people @MONTH1 learn from it and it would be unfair to take this information away from everyone else. A library is a place to go to learn about different things and should alway have information on different subjects and topics. Many people have learned things from a library that have affected their lives and will keep learning more things as long as they are still opened to a wide source of information.",4,4
3264,"I believe that everyone has the right to choose what book should be banned form their children,but not from the public. Everyonehas their owen belief in what he or she reads or rights even watches so the library is perfect the way it is . We can not through out books we find offensive because of our beliefs because somebody else might want to come along and read about a certain relgion or a certain topic. If we through out all the books and made a library with  only the books we wanted we'd be in a lot of debt because then we'd have to build libraries for everyone instead of one that allows us all to enjoy our favorite books all at the same place. So if we have a problem with a book or movie form the library weshould just keep our children awayfrom that item and inform them on why they should not be subjected to that item",2,3
4570,"Taking books off the shelves will not change anything children are just goin to @CAPS1 to a different place to find the book, @CAPS1 to a book store or Other librabies if they like it. If I seen a book and I knew I wasnt suppose to read but then I knew it was  good music, book, or magazie. I would get it cause thats what children do explore. books are here to read and to look at i feel if you know im not suppose to read it make me show prof of age or not give it to me.          Really dont understand why sum books be in stores and people dont want u reading them. Sum children dont read at all and to see them to pick up a book, @CAPS2 down to read should be good eoungh. But there is always a age group thats not suppose to read some books. But at the smae time you cant keep the child away from the world, and what it brings you. The book are put there for a reason and not just to be walked past.          I feel like the reason why children listen to music is that some time the track relate to them in a way that a other person would not understand. So they feel the song other thren what another person would hear just the @CAPS3, @CAPS4, @CAPS5, and @CAPS6. Thats not what sum parents want you to hear.     Magazines tells alot of things and show to much for the younger minds. Im a father my self and would want my son at the age of @NUM1 looking at any naked girl or adds about pron in @ORGANIZATION1 books or any of that kind. parents can sometimes be over hard on a child and not let them do a lot of things. But they feel that they knows whats best for u. What ever  they tell you is not wrong cause the @MONTH1 have been through it already. That would only lead to them doing things behide there backs. But if they want learn the easy way its aways the hard way.",2,2
3438,"The books in the libraries that I have read so far dont seem like they would be offensive to anyone and I havn't really listen to the music in the libraries or watch the movies and the magazines seem fine to.  That doesnt mean that there isn't any of those that can be offensive to other people but if there is then I think that they should take them out of the libraries but I think if someone found something like that they would probably just put it back and not go there again.     If they took out every book, music, movies, and magazines that people thought were offensive then I bet alot of them would be out and that wouldnt be fair to other people because maybe they want or listen or read or watch them and they would be really mad if they found out they was taken out because other peoplr thought they were offensive.  Some people would probably understand that some of those could hurt someones feelings or be offensive to other people but then theres other ones that dont care.     I think that some of them should be taken out if they are really bad and I wouldn't want other little kids reading them and gettin their feelings hurt or anything but if there not that bad then I don't they should be gone and I don't think people would really care if those stayed in them.  If thiers ones that are really bad and if they stayed in the libraries then probably no one would want to come back to the libraries and sooner or later less and less people would stop going.      So the best thing to probably do is just take them out and keep the people that keep going in the libraries because alot of people enjoy reading and thats what they do for fun and they would be really upset if they couldnt go no more over something that stupid",3,4
3761,"History is bond to repeat itself right? Well, we must make sure that this is a great opportunity to ensure our future @LOCATION2. By censuring items on certain shelves is like when your mother makes you leave the kitchen so you don't get burned. This is just a way to protect the minds of young ones, which are like little sponges soaking everything they see or hear up.      The effects of what @MONTH1 come are far worst than making it so an adult must reach a little high for the book they want to read. Making it so only certain material is available to young children and teenagers is a way to prevent the same racism, poverty, assinations, and religions protests of the past. The @ORGANIZATION1 prides itself on that children are the future, well, why not put in the effort to prevent the from seeing what the see or read?      I wish that when I was younger many people were trying to stop causes of such things as teen pregancy, drugs, alcohol, and abuse. But, there wasn't, there was a thirteen year old girl in my class who got pregant. She thought it was cool, because she read it in a book. This book she read wasn't hers it was her mothers and she left it on the table to take back to the library. Her mother forgot and @PERSON2 read that book. She told a bunch of friends and me about it. @PERSON2 said the book explained what guys wanted. She did that because of a made up story her mother checked out at a library.     This story makes me think about why they should put books on a different shelf or higher up. I have two younger sisters who already have to worry about being picked on; because of their clothes, their religion, the fact that they only listen to certain music. They should be able to go to school, and not worry about the book that they @MONTH1 grab at the library. My sisters are the inspiration for me to make the world in which we live a better place,well, my brother is too. But, my point is they should have to live up to the expectations of others, or the what's cool.      By censuring what children are reading or listening to is a way to make them be children. When they look at magazines or listen to music, they make discissions that could effect the rest of their lives. Just like how @ORGANIZATION2 has a new song out. The lyrics are inapporiate of many young children, but you can look it up on youtube. The lyrics of many songs or singles that have just been released are astounding. These songs show us why children are having children, or doing drugs. It is all caused by what they see or hear around them.      Our country has hit an economical low, and this is caused by the youth not taking life seriously. I think that if we could focus on the factors in hand, such as censuring we @MONTH1 accomplish something no one else has. To show the world @LOCATION2's youth is the future, and it is looking pretty bright. We each should take proud it making the children learn better, act better, and above all make their dreams come true.      If we have more students reading stuff such as, ' @LOCATION1, or To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2,' and enjoy them it would show that their dreams can come true fiction or non-fiction. It doesn't aways matter as long as your reading something that isn't stopping your mind to grow and develop fully.      Many of the young women in my sophmore class have read, ' the @CAPS3 series,' and they loved it which made them read other vamiper books. It shows we can read stuff that is stimulating and not just to make us act like celebrates who party all the time or go to jail. By looking at those magazines or reading books about those people teenagers think that everyone is doing it. To tell you the truth more people aren't doing it and have found other ways to stay occupied. We have say in whether or not the future is good or bad why not make the choice easier by elimating the ones we would choose for ourselves at the age of children picking up the books or reading the magazines; about @PERSON1 who just drove around with her baby on her lap. What choice are you choosing for you life?     In my personal oppion I believe children and adults should have separate televisions shows, magazines, and books. We want children to mature without the lies that everyone lives this way. These are the reasons as well as more to why censuring in libraries would help the impact of lies to children lessen. To add one final thing, would you tell everything you know to a five year old if you knew they would retain every word? I don't think I would want them to mature that fast, otherwise what is the point of life, or school. To go and learn what you already know",4,4
4223,"Books, magazines, movies, music, etc, are all good to read, watch or listen to.      When I listen to music or watch movies or even read books sometimes. I wonder how do people come up with these ideas.The real reason is why people listen to music, read books watch movies are so offensive. In todays world you got music with all this negative stuff about people, talkin about people, with the curse words its not a good look for the people who make the music or the people who listen to the music. I feel that that stuff not be allowed in the shelves and it should be removed. Parents dont want there little children hearing that negative music. When they grow up they are going to be like them because everybody sings there songs and everything else.     I feel movies should not be removed from the shelves. The reason i say is because movies are funny, scary, sad etc.Sometimes u need the offensive in a movie, with out that it would not be good most of the time. One of my favorite is @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and it was about character from the past @CAPS1 and @CAPS4 get back together and do one more mission. That movie was offensive but u still have a good time watchin it because its has the nice cars and good character. Movies should never get removed from the shelves cause out offensive of movies it would not be fun.People can not go to the movies with there friends and have a good time.If u are taking little kids out make sure u pick the right movies for them.To conclude argument Music is not bad thing to listen cause u have good music to but all im saying is make sure to watch what u listen to and get in trouble trying to do what they say in there music.To the movies keep comming out with good movies and keep making the movies good",3,2
4205,"Do you like what I like? Maybe and maybe not. What is or not offensive to you compared to other varies on both ends. Why? Everyone has their point of view. You @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not agree and we have others who do not care. There are many which includes: religious beliefs, having independence, and experimenting.     Religious beliefs are important would you not agree? Certain material in this world maybe offensive to their own kind. Such as gay rights. This @MONTH1 apply to everyone else that they are not accepting it. For the ones who do accept it, you can tell they are open minded. Unlike the rebels going against it that is their own state of mind. I believe it is important you go along with your religious beliefs.     Independence is what we are or what we assume to have or already have. Whether the music, movies, magazines, etc are offensive to others this has no effects to you. Why? It is because you know what is right and wrong. So what if all the non sense things @MONTH1 have caught your attention. Should you take control and get rid of it? No. It does not bother you. You take it as it is, being independent.     Experimenting is self contained. As simple as it is you do it or do not. It is more than likey that people are/were under the influence. I, myself, have been in that siutation before. I'm known to be the crazy child in the family. My dad would always lecture me about being careful with who I hang with when I'm out. As a teenager I let those words pass by me. I was always the youngest out of the people I hung out with. Was I ever under the influence? Yes. Did I ever get hurt? No. I can and will say I experimented with life.     Does it hurt to observe or experiment with the bad? It usually varies. Religious beliefs, it @MONTH1 or @MONTH1 not be disrespectful. To have independence, you are the one in control. Experimenting, that is a choice on your own. What is offensive to me @MONTH1 not be to you. I have my own state of mind and so do you.",3,3
4334,"Do I think that books, movies, music or magazines should be removed from the library? No I don't I think that should be removed only because if you remove them your probably going to lose more costumer's.     I'm going to be honest here, most people like to read. I know I sometimes read to study and if they got rid of the books that I read to study. How would I study? Even teachers go to the library to study or to even get books, or maybe get books for there grand kids or there kids. Parents do the samething.      People don't understand that music helps everybody some point in time. I know people who listen to music to help them consentriate on different things like homework, regular work, or even being stressed out. There are alot of different ways that music helps alot of people. If people decided to feel offensive over stuff like that then something is wrong with them because after all these years there have been no complaints.     Honestly i have never got movies or magazine's from the lilbrary before. People do it for there kids or grand kids, I don't really see the big deal. Its not like they are watching anything bad. They mostly have kid movies not bad ones.     Why would people want to take little thing like that from little kids? In a way that makes me mad because I like little kids they don't hurt anybody.",3,3
3708,"Everyone likes to watch movies, jam to some music, and get lost in an interesting book. Therefore everyone should be able to read, watch, or listen to what they want and the same things as other people are reading, listening to, and watching. Some things are needed to look up or look at if one is doing a project. Other people just @MONTH1 be entertained by certain peices of liturature, or music. In that case, why censor certain things that people are interested in, or even things to research, in libraries?     Many people enjoy violent writing or gorey movies. Reading these things also amusses them. So why take away what they like? If a library takes certain books off of their shelves, then they could be taking away a type of literature that people are interested in. If one removes a book that twenty people take pleasure in reading, then thats twenty people that are not going to want to read anything else. People are different in many ways. That includes the variety of things humans are interested in. For example, things they are interested to read. Humans having a major differences in characteristics, meaning they don't enjoy all the same things. The articles, magazines, or movies @MONTH1 be not suited for schools or libraries, but if it's a topic people like, or if it's someone needs for a project, then there is no reason to get rid of it.     Some books offten offend certain groups or races of people, but the book gets it uniqueness from what it says. Some books are writen in times of racisim. This shuold'nt make a book worth critisizing because that was the way things were said in that time. It allows the book to give off a feeling of living in the time is based in. On the other hand, some magazines are writen about horrible events and wars, but people find entertainment in reading about these events going on in the world. They want to know what is really happening across seas or even around home. Someone isn't able to know what's happening is no one lets him or her read the magazine.     Authors and writers write these things for the entertainment of people who want to read them. Due to the wide veriety of interest people have, there are many different types of writings. People should'nt have their favorite book taken off shelves just to see that the guy right next to him found the book he loves. That just would'nt be fare. Libraries should put on the shelf what people write, so that others @MONTH1 enjoy them.",4,4

A library should have the right to put whatever materials it would like on to their shelves.      There will always be offensive songs, books, movies, and magazines.

'But if they have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work i abhor- then they also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And we have no books on the shelf for any of us' (Paterson). Paterson is simply explaining that if somone finds somthing offensive and wants it removed from a shelf then soon all books will be removed, and there will be nothing left at all on the shelves.      A library is a place for everyone to come and find what they are looking for without any disterbances. A person probably isnt looking for somthing offensive. Therefore coming accross somthing that is offensive @MONTH1 be disterbing; however they should be able to try to ignore it. It is that persons choice to choose that library to attend to. So they will choose to maybe find offensive materials. If somone does not wish to come across offensive material they should choose not to go to the library.     Americans have the right to be free, so does a library. If a person comes across a offinsive piece of material it should be ignored. A library can not please everyone by taking out all of it merchandice that @MONTH1 be considerd offensive. There simply would be nothin left. People should be aware that they @MONTH1 come across some offensive materials when going in to a library, so it will allways be the peoples choice of attending that library",3,4
4741,"I belive that offensive books should be taken off the shelf. Some books are offensive and some are inaproprate. The libarian could get rid of the books, so the little kids can'@CAPS2 get the inaproprate book. Movies that are rate '@CAPS1' and above should be removed. Anything that has an 'A' rating should be removed, the libaries are a public place to rent and return, buy or sell, or to trade movies, books, and etc. Keeping the books that are safe for kids is important for their mental health.     Anything inaproprate could be censored by a black marker. The old libuary I used to go to, had all the slang, cus-words, and etc, all marked out with a black sharpie. Some of the movies were thrown out of the rating '@CAPS2' to all the above, the magazines, had marks on the pages also, censored the slag in the magazine. The music at the libuary was blocked, some music was not blocked, and the rest were the censored part of the songs. The librares should do the same like the old one did.",3,2

What do you think; I think so ? for centuries people have been writing,making video,and, all types of music. Some consider it a freedom of speech. Others might think of it as being rebellious or conspiracy.     I believe @CAPS1 are exceptional writers and promising producers  and artists. But not all medias are good. Over a vast amount of time young children have been influenced by medias such as:books,movies,music,etc...Its perfectly normal for many adults who have children to discriminate against certain media .But thats not all @CAPS1 are more cases than just children that are suffering theres also religon, race, gender, sexuality, and social groups.          @CAPS1 should be a certain rules and certains laws that are against such wrong doings.But everyone is entiltled to @CAPS1 opinion.Hundreds of people are discreminated because of what they here and see in the medias.A life changing expierience for me was the movie The @CAPS2 @CAPS3. This could be considered offensive to lots of peolpe such as those of the african american decent or any other race that has suffered similar abuse.          This is just a few issues with freedom of speech ,but @CAPS1 will always be disagreements and differennt views of oppinion.But I for one believe that theres just certain stuff that shoukdnt be allowed to be put out in to public media",3,3
3726,"Censorship helps prevent people from viewing, listening, or read disturbing images or ideas for certain age groups. But in the case of libraries, all the books would have to be taken off the shelves. And if all the books are taken off the shelves, then all the books in stores would have to be thrown out as well.     Books are essential part of life. They have great ideas and thoughts expressed through these amazing pieces of word art. People who think that the books in libraries should be censored, are fools. These people want to keep their children and themselves safe, and that is understandable, but at the same time they are hurting people with the decision they have decided to put forth. Authors are hurt because it is their work that is being censored. People who enjoy reading the books, that are wanted censored, would no longer be able to read those books.     It is mainly the choice of the person to avoid these books if they truely find it offensive to themselves. They should not go all out of their way and try to censor them, because they would eventually might cause everyone or some people to think that they could find a book that should be censored. And if that happens, then there would be no more books on the shelves. The government will take notice and ban these books or worse remove all books forever just like what happened in @CAPS1 @NUM1.     Over all, books are a good thing. They gives us inspiration, and help us pull through life with the thoughts expressed in them. It is your choice to avoid the books that upset you, not what other people think about them.",4,4
4490,"Censorship can be considered as a major problem.  I believe it is our right to read and publish what we want. It should not be another person's opinion effecting what we can and cannot read, listen to, or even watch.  Lastly, censorship is a popular communist trend.  Therefore, I believe censorship is wrong.     First of all, we have a right to say, read, write, and watch what we want, as long as it is not slandering someone.  I don't believe that issue of slander is what is causing the censorship of many books today.  So, in any other case censorship would be wrong and immoral.     Second, it shouldn't be someone elses opinion that effects whether anything is censored.  My opinion @MONTH1 differ from another person's and their opinion @MONTH1 be way different from someone elses.  If they think it should be censored, they shouldn't read it themselves.  Others @MONTH1 find the book, movie, or magazine to be great and very informative or interesting.     Lastly, censorship is a communist trend.  Last I checked, the @LOCATION1 is a democracy.  So, it would be going back on our fundamentals of government to censor anything that isn't detrimental or slander to a person or race.     So, censorship shouldn't be allowed anywhere.  It is a very communist thing to do.  It infringes our rights.  Lastly, opinions are varied among people what should and should not be censored making it impossible to know what really should and shouldn't be censored",3,3
3354,"I dont believe that it should matter what books are in a library. If you think a book would be offensive to you, dont read it. If you were to read a book with opinions about a cirtian race or religion, just keep your opinion to yourself. Most people make a big deal about cirtian things to get attention.      If a library was split up into sections about topics and such, it would help a lot, and it would be a quicker way to get your books and get out to make room for others. I honestly have not seen a @CAPS1 in a school library, but its probly because I did not spend much time lookin for it. And if there isnt one, its probly because someone complained about it.     If you are religious, you should have the right to be able to read what you want. Theres all kinds of weird books in the library, and a lot of people just look at them for the fun of it. I dont know why some people have so many problems with certian things. Like I said before, if you dont like it, dont read it",3,3
3015,"Should certain materials be removed from the shelves of the library that are found offensive? @PERSON1 states that we will have no books left of the shelf to read if everyone removes a book they do not approve of. What some people think is the most innocent book, could offend another individual. Different people find different topics offensive. No two people think the same.     Though certain books or magazines @MONTH1 have offensive subjects or materials in them, if they were to be removed, how would we learn? For example, say there was a historical fiction book about racism. The book might show different perspectives of how people lived when racism flourished. Readers could learn from the books how racism affects people, and why it is wrong. Learning about dislikes can make someone more knowledgable on why some people think the way they do. The readers can learn from mistakes made in the past. Books or movies depict how life was years or even centuries ago; morals were different a while ago from what they are now.     If many people were to agree that a certain material is very offensive or not appropriate for adolescents or young children, one option that could be available is only allowing adults to check it out. The library could also put a warning on it if they think the content of the material is too harsh. Another idea could be setting up reviews on a website with a list of each book in the library. Consumers can read the review first and then decide whether to check it out or not.     People have their own opinions and views on materials. A person should learn to be tolerant of materials; others might truely enjoy it. This article might be offensive to those who read it, because they might think things should be more sensored rather than tolerated.  If someone does not like the material, they are not forced to check it out of the library so why cause a fuss over it? One person might find a topic very offensive while that same topic sparks interest in another individual. Each person has different morals so who is to say what should and should not be in a library?",3,4
4378,"Whever you go these days you see viloence in evry store around the world. Children growing up in the world is our future and they see that negative output. Alot of the kids and young adults thrive off of the offensive materials the world puts out there.               I think that the offensive thing's should be taken off the shelves. And sold in stores for adults that are twenty one and older. If people sell offensive things in stores were it allows young teenagers to buy those products , then we are just puting ourselfs at harm. I was just in a book store the other day and i seen magazines that were not apporiate. I thought to myself how could they sell these types of magazines. Music , movies, and magazines shouldn't even be sold in a book store , that's why its called a book store.                It's not called a movie, music , or magazine store they call it a book store for a reason. If students read books or listen to music that is offensive they are going to grow up thinking it's ok. Too be that way or treat somebody different because of who they are or what they represent. I'm not saying take all the books out of the store just take the offensive one's and have a twenty one or older sign. So the kids dont end up getting a hold of the book and learning something they shouldn't.               When i was young i went to the book store all the time with my mom. I would just pick up any book there was and start trying to read. Alot of the time my mom would take the book from me. Because it was offensive, i didn't know that at the time i was just a little kid. In today's society kids are growing up quicker than they really have to and thats not a good thing. Kids should be able to be kids and read kid's books.               I guess it does'nt really matter for middle school and high school kids. Because those kids really dont like to read at all. The kids that we have to look out for is the one's in elementary. Because those kid's actually want to learn how to read. And if we put a book about drugs on the shelve those kids will read it. And those kids will learn about it and be curious to what that drug has a effect on you.               In the end it does'nt really matter what i say because people are going to keep making books. Anytime type of book it is all based on how much money they can make. It does'nt matter if it is negative or a possitive book. the company wants to make money and so does the author.",3,3
4639,"What is censorship? Many would say it's a book without cuss words or it's a movie without racism. For me, I think censorship is covering up the truth. I don't think movies or books should be taken off the self because some people find it offensive. When a book uses a cuss word to show anger or simply use the word, I think that it's okay because isn't that what we hear in the world already? Now I know some people @MONTH1 not have grown up hearing foul words but many of us have.      With movies I think that if people have a problem with their children watching something bad or offensive then they shouldn't let their kid watch it. Thats whats wrong with people now a days, they don't want to take blame for things that go wrong in their lives. People use censorship as a way to make themselves feel like their a good parent or that the world owes them something.      When it comes to someone thinking that a movie or book has gone to far with their race then censorship gets thrown around. Many people have issues with their race or nationality being messed with. Though it's funny to see that race use those foul words among themselves but when it's in a book it's racism. Or when a certain race is being made fun of or shown in a movie in a way that that race doesn't feel comfortable with, that movie is called racist.      I feel that if people have an issue with something they don't agree with, then they should take it out of their own lives. Too many people try to control something, like cencorship. For years now people have wanted books that are read in school to be censored for bad language. Why put all that time toward the book being censored and not the school. I know kids in school use foul language all the time. Even worse then the books we read. If adults would realize it's their kids they need to censore and not the books then censorship wouldn't have become such a huge issue. People need to just realize that by cencoring the books or movies doesn't make the offencive words or bad images go away, it just covers them up",4,4
3516,"Books are gateways to other worlds.  Today there are books on almost any topic anybody could dream of.  People use books to forget their troubles and take a trip to somewhere outside of themselves.  Now the content of some books are not always appropriate.  Schools try to provide books that appeal to all audiences, but that ability is being impaired by books being banned from shelves.  Students then can't read a book simply because someone else didn't appprove of the content.  That is unfair and should be stopped.  Students should have the right to make choose what they want to read, yet some people want to take that right away from students.  Students, are also able to make choices on what's appropriate for them to read.  If lawmakers give in to the complaints of a few people it could hinder a students rights and make students believe that they are not trusted.     The content of what goes into a book is up to the author.  The books someone decides to read is up to that particular reader.  Sometimes authors go into extensive detail to get their point across or have a book with very mature content in them.  Now some people think that because a book is inappropriate in their views then it shouldn't be avalivable to read at all.  This is unfair not only to any potiental reader of that book, but also the author who worked hard to write that book.  Students are smarter than many people give them credit for.  They know what they should and shouldn't be reading, but if the choice of what they read is left up to other people they feel betrayed and untrusted.      Students have as many rights as people who don't go to school.  If books are being taken of shelves based on a few people opinions then their rights are being infringed upon by the people who deemed it inappropriate.  Now the students freedom to choose what they want to read is gone, and all that remains is books choosen worthy by other people.  Rights are something guarenteed to students as the enter school, buty now rights are slowly being taken away from students.  The right to choose what book they read is one that should not be taken.  As author Katherine Paterson said, 'If I have the right to remove a book from the shelf, that work that i abhor, then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.'  If one person says they think a book should be taken away, then another person wants another book taken away, until the point where no books are left then how will students ever get to read?     Books are essential to a students growth into adulthood.  If people gain the right to take books off shelves then music, movies, magazines will all get taken off shelves too.  Books are for any reader that decides they want to go to that world.  Students have the right to choose what books they read, as well as the ability to know what they should read.  Books should remain where they belong, in schools on the shelves.",4,4
4651,"I believe that certain materials should not be removed if they are found innapropriate. There are several things that explain why I think this.     For one thing, some libraries don't have certain genres of books. For example, say one library @MONTH1 have action but not thriller while another library has thriller but not action. If some materials were removed from public libraries due to censorship, people would only be able to find it online or in certain stores. Second reason being that kids would not get into these kind of books if it was innapropriate, unless they're given approval by parents. If these materials were to still be on shelves, you should at least be a certain age to read it, unless the parents make it to where their kids don't have to get approval from them first. Sure it would make the library more kid-friendly, but a book shouldn't be kept away from a kid only because of a few bad words. Lastly, some adults would be upset of the removal of some books. Some books that are intended would be better off staying in the library. If they were to remove these books, adults would then have to find a book online.     So censorship, to me, is not going to make any difference. If this continues, it @MONTH1 lead so far, that the libraries would have to be closed. Take my word for it. In conclusion, don't let censorship take over our libraries.",3,3
3474,"Can books, music, movies, and other materials be perfect for everyone? Everyone has their own oppinion and beliefs on what materials are good, and what are not acceptable for the human minds. All over the world young kids, young adults, and adults are reading books, magazines, listening to music, and watching movies. Those are all hobbies most people enjoy doing. Everyone reads different kind of books, whether its mystery, romance, or bible based books, people read. Removing books, magazines, and other materials off the shelves in a library leads to an unsuccessful empty library.      When people come and search for a book to read, they search for what they think they will enjoy. If they enjoy one thing, another person might not. They might find a book offensive, but does that mean everyone else is offensive by the book as well? Taking that book out leaves the person who would enjoy that book stuck searching for another book. Everyone is different, everyone has their own story, just like these books do.     Magazines are like books, they are meant to be enjoyed. I believe some magazines might not be appropriate for some people, But that doesn't mean they should take it off the shelf. It means that person should simply not read it. Magazines are made for all people to enjoy, that's why there are so many different kinds. They want to fit each magazine personally to each individual.     Music is the number one entertainment people enjoy. There is a reason why there is so many different genres. The music industry try their best to sort the music to your taste. Just because one song has stuff in it you don't like doesn't mean you can delete that song from everyone. Music is used for many different ways. It relaxes you, pumps you up, it is used for parties, events, and so many other things. All songs are different so you can use them however you want. To band music because someone doesn't like it, changes music forever. There would be no music to listen to.     People should be able to watch what movies they want. That's why there are ratings on movies. What is acceptable for teenagers, but not be acceptful for young kids. That's why they should not watch it. If people banned all the movies they thought were inapropriate. There would be no rented movie stores, theaters, or success in the movie production industry. Everyone should know what kind of movies they like, and they should just watch what they like, and leave the other movies for the people who enjoy it.     No, books, magazines, movies, and music can not be perfect for everyone. Materials bring all different kind of subjects, and stories for everyone. Each materials brings enjoyment to different people. To band all the materials you believe is inappropriate will leave the shelves empty. What kind of library is that",4,4

Just because it offends them other people @MONTH1 find it interesting. If peolpe just started taking books off the shelf because they were offended by them, who knows how many books we would have left. people can  be offended in the most easiest ways. We could have no books on the shelf because almost every book out there can offend someone in a way.The same thing with moives, moives can offende people justr the same as books. I think moives would offend more than a book would.     In conclusion, Books, movies or anything of that matter should not be took off the shelf because it offended someone.

Everybody has their likes and dislikes with music, books, movies, magazines, etc. If the reader does not like the book, then the reader will not continue reading the book. If the listener does not enjoy rap music, then they will stop listening and try to find a different kind of music. This topic is about personal opinion and choice. If it was me, then I would say yes to allowing censored materials. I like getting the full effect out of things. I wanna hear the rawness of a song or the anger of a character in a book. I don't want to read and see a bunch of little stars on a censored word. I want to see that word and feel its full effect.          I am actually reading the very controversial book '@CAPS1 of @ORGANIZATION1'. As you @MONTH1 know the author of this book is named @PERSON1. Another thing you @MONTH1 know is the use of the '@CAPS2-word'. This is a very controversial book because he doesn't call colored people black or colored, he calls them the '@CAPS2-word' throughout most of the book. Most people now think this is very racist. But back in @LOCATION1's time it was very commonly said and used in his society. It wasn't racist back in that time, I mean it still was but it wasn't as controversial as it is today. Now critics and some readers don't agree with this term and think the book should not be held in libraries or read at all for that fact. I have to disagree though. I understand why he used the word, it was a common word in his time. If you take that word away from the book, you lose some history of the old south.     People have the freedom of speech to say whatever they want to say, whether that be in written form or verbally said. I honestly say some of these censored words. Most of the time these words are said when I am angry at myself or another person. People can't control what we say, so why should they be able to control what we write or sing? Just a thought. Saying that, on the other hand I can see why people don't want these censored words. Maybe they just don't want their little kid to say a censored word in class to the teacher or to another classmate. That's understandable, but you can't protect your kids from censored words. They are everywhere. From video games, to movies, and even most books now. You cannot control what other people do or say. It is their freedom to do whatever they want.",3,3

Books, music, and other entertaining things are here as an @ORGANIZATION1 so if you dont like it then you don't have to deal with it.     I feel that it is @ORGANIZATION1 neccessary that books should be removed from the shelves  just because someone has gotten offended @ORGANIZATION1 it. You were @ORGANIZATION1 told that it is a must to read that book and it wasn't the company nor the author's fault that you rented the book and you felt insulted. Most likely there were @ORGANIZATION1 directing the story towards you so why get all worked up over something that has happen to you and take it out on the media?  You chose it @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1 @ORGANIZATION1. Why make the company lose investment over something that could be easily taken care of @ORGANIZATION1 simply taking it back where you got it from?      I have read @CAPS1 books, listened to @CAPS1 songs, and seen lots of movies that weren't in my best interest but I didn't make them stop saling them because i'm pretty sure someone out there likes it. Why stop someone elses enjoyment because of my uninterest? It's really @ORGANIZATION1 that neccesary. And that's the problem in the world today, people take little situations into a big catastraphy for no reason. If you don't like it then don't get it.

Taking them off the shelves would be more than unnessecary just because some person doesn't like it. People have different opinions about life and that's what makes every indiviual different from one another. So why ruin other people's fun just to get what you want?     As I stated before for it is @ORGANIZATION1 neccessary to remove an item from the shelves because someone has taken offense to something.

People @MONTH1 not want there kids to look at certain things but, they need to keep them were there kids cant find them. Kids in the world hear bad language, see fighting, and even see people get shot. There is a lot more bad things in life than a movies, books, and music that childreen listen to, watch, or read.     I think that the world is more harmfull sometime than anything. Adults @MONTH1 want kids to grow up differently than others so they need to tell them not to be listening and watching the bad things on tv. But, if there kids wanna learn about things that happen thats not the greatest, then people should let them.     It wouldn't be right if people or movies or things had to change just because other people dont like it. Why should other people have to change just for the ones who dont like it. There are some materials that are bad but can be only purchesed at the age of eight-teen. Thats why people should be ok with things that dont envolve minors. Having things censored ruins a lot of things, the fact that its was made that way it should be kept that way.     I'm sure many people @MONTH1 not agree with my report but, it's something to look and think about. People wouldn't make the things they do if it was supposed to be censored. That takes the whole meaning out of a lot of things. So my answer is NO about taking things away that are not censored. Keep them so people can understand life the easy way and the hard way.     Sincerely,      @PERSON1",3,3
3137,"Some books in libraries offend others. So should they be removed? That is the point im going to get across today. Keeping people under self-control is top priorities for the public. So why do they keep releasing and publishing books if it offends certain groups?     Graphic and gorey books are books usually that disgust people but should all contain a warning symbol on it for people with weak stomachs and those who just can't handle it. So by that means, I'm fine with it. People need to accept that the world is not all sunshine and rainbows and that gruesome stuff is out there. This is my take on the whole situation. So people, if you can't take the heat, stay out of the kitchen.     However offense material to races, religions, and other personal aquisitions, is something of different concerns. This can certainly inflame groups, and even start protest or boycotting it. Authors in some cases need to review their materialand make sure it won't cause any disruption. Inflaming the public is not what you want young authors. This can not only make the public upset, but can possibly lead to the author getting fired.      False statement or inaccurate statements in books can lead to public curiosity and even conspiracy. Not only will it cause a stir up in the press, but just like the race/religion thing, it can cause the author to be fired.  This is not what the author wants. So making sure the work is true and not hipotheticle is a good step. These are great steps to achieving a positive step to public influence.     So inconclusion, authors have lots on their hands. All the way from race issues, religion, fale statements, and so on. These are some of the things authors want to avoid. Making the public recommend the book, and it having positive outcome on the press is the best an author can ask for",3,3
4374,At jefferson'vill high school we do't have the right to remove a book form the shelf if there a book that not for you do not get it like a bad movie . It like get a bad lunch your not go to get it so why get a bad book or a movi,1,1
3232,"Do you believe that certain materials,such as books, music, movies, magazines, ect., offensive? Support your position with convincing arguments from your own experince, observations, and/or reading.           I do believe that if it's a book you not suppose to get, if it's not for age group, don't get it. Some libraries contains books that's highly not appropriate for children, they have sections for adults and children to check out books. Some libraries need book monitors to guide and put up certain types of books.The library is  a plcae with all types of books, so you should go to your own section and check out your type of book.           When I first went to the library for the time I didn't know what book to check out, so the librarian should me my section by showing me my age group. By then I was checking out books that was appropriate for my age, magazines I didn't care to much about, I just wanted to read a whloe book.              In conclusion, when ever you nedd a book good or check out your section, make the book is appropriate for you and feed you mind with knowledge.",3,3
4737,"I think that everyone has the right to hate or abhor cetian works but only the author of the work has the right to take it off of the shelf. The reason that just anyone can not take a work off the shelf is if the one person hates the work but everyone else likes it then imanenge how the people who like the work must feel when they hear it was distroyed.     Can you think of how the author of any work would feel if thousands of their works were being distroyed without any thought to others? I can and I feel horible just thinking about it so I belive that is the reason that only the creator of anything should make the disicion if their work should be saved or distroyed.     With these reasons that I have shaired with you please consider how everyone feels before you destroy anything if it is a book, movie, song, or even a childs dreams think about how thet would feel if anything of theirs was distroyed.",3,3
4550,"Alot of things can be found offensive now days, but that does not mean you take it away from others who enjoy it. Everyone has their own view, and opinon on things. For the things people find offensive I believe they should just simply stay away from it.     No, I do not believe certain materials should be removed from the library shelves. Somethings people @MONTH1 find offensive others might enjoy. Its simple, if it comes to the point were people are causing problems then maybe that will be up to the people that work in the libraries. Yes, there @MONTH1 be alot of things that people take offensive, but that dose not mean take away the things others @MONTH1 enjoy. I have been to many libraries in my life. I have not really seen anything offensive, but I have seen some books and movies for adults only. Honestly in my eyes its simple, if there is something you find offensive just stay away from it, because others @MONTH1 enjoy it.     Its not up to me weather the materials should be removed from the library shelves. Although I do believe that people who find things offensive should just stay away from it. You have to take things into consideration before jumping straight into conclusions.",3,3
3929,"What do you think about Books? Do you think it matters how appropriate they are? Well im going to tell you my oppinion on the books that should and shouldn't be in libraries.      I think that there are many different few from many different people on books. Someone just cant say that they think a book shouldn't be in a library period. I think that if maybe it is a inappropriate book from someone in grade school to read then it should be in the high school or a public library. I can see that some parents @MONTH1 not want to have their kid reading it but i think that they are going to hear a lot worse and see worse than a book is going to have.      I can also see where parents are coming from when they say that they dont want there child reading that kind of book. I belive that if a kid wants to read it than they are going to read it, parents shouldn't be so up tight on what there kids read. I know that they want to protect their kid from seeing that stuff but its going to happen one day so they might as well get used to it. Also a grade school shouldn't even have a book that would be considered inappropriate to a student in there library, or should have a parent sign somethign saying that they are ok with it.     So inconclusion thats what I say if parents have a problem with it than they should discuss it with the school. They should just go in and talk to the librarian and tell them that they dont want their child to check out such books. All a parent would have to do is go in to the school or where ever their child is getting the book and tell them that and it would solve all problems",3,3
3195,"Library Censorship     Everyone has their favorite book. But if it offended someone, should he be allowed to remove it? Offensive materials should not be removed from shelves. If we removed books that offended even one person, then no books would remain.     As americans, we have the right to freedom of speech. Authors use their freedom in their writing, just like musicians use their freedom to make music. But if we denied them their right to put out their creations, we would be denying them their basic rights as an american citizen.      Personally, I hate rap. I don't even consider it to be music, due to the fact that no one actually sings. But I do understand that a large percent of our population does enjoy listening to it. Should I be allowed to remove it from shelves, leaving teenagers without their music, denying artists' freedom of speech, and ultimately, leaving them unemployed?     One of my favorite series is the @PERSON2 series, by @PERSON1. It is about a young teenager who learns to deal with all the struggles of growning up by depending on @CAPS1, and it helped me do the same. But because it is a @CAPS2 series, should it be removed from shelves? Should other young girls be denied the chance to read this life-changing series, simply because someone might find it offensive?     Although some wish they could elimate certain materials that they find offensive, it isn't fair to the authors, musicians, or fans of those pieces of work. However, those who find it offensive should be allowed to avoid it. Libraries need to make sure they separate each topic distinctly, so people can easily tell where they should or shouldn't avoid. Libraries are suppost to be a resource for everyone, which means they need to have materials for everyone, even though they might seem offensive.",4,4
4723,"When it comes to my idea of having censorship in the libraries around the world I believe that there are cases when there are books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that should not be on the shelves. Not only are there things in the books, etc. that children might not understand and take the wrong way, but there are also things that adults of any age might take offensivley as well.     In my years of being in school I have encountered many books, music, movies, magazines, etc., that I have thought should never even end up on the shelves of libraries. For one example, I was looking through the library one day for a book that I would be able to do my book report on, and just from reading the back of the book I learned that this book involved drugs, sex, and many other things that I thought would be inappropriate for someone even my age to read. For the librarians and other school workers involved in the buying of books, I am sure that they never even think twice about a book being offered to young children and teenagers that it would be inapropriate or offensive, but in almost all cases every single book has something that would prove them wrong.     Also I have encountered offensive behavior while reading a book that was said to be a wonderful book even for someone under the age of twelve. In my own experience from reading the book I would have to say that these people are crazy and should reevaluate the the specific age they market to. Not only are there books that I have found in the library to be inappropriate and offensive but also many magazines, movies, and music. There is usually not alot of music that would involve offensive behavior in libraries but in some cases there are. For example, I new someone that was doing a report on pop culture and while researching the music and listening to the music that the library provided, they found it to be very offensive and inappropriate for himself to hear. Other than that I have found that movies and magazines are just as bad as books when it comes to being offensive.     I myself would think that teenagers above the age of @NUM1 would understand the meaning of being mature. I have observed that most teenagers and even children that read offensive books end up having a behavior that most parents and teachers do not approve of. When it comes time for my children to reach this age I would hope that they would never act like some of the kids I have seen or spoken with.     After understanding how much inappropriate/offensive behavior there is in books, music, movies, magazines, etc., I not only recommend that they evaluate the type of books, and other resources that are offered in libraries, but also I have realized that I sure hope they get this matter taken care of right away. I not only feel that parents around the world would feel the same as I do, but I know for a fact that I would never want my children to read books that I have read or been offered through my high school library. This is a very serious matter that all teachers and parents should realize when they recommend books to children and even teenagers. The world is becomming more and more violent every single day, and it is up to the future children to solve this problem. In a sitaution like this, we do not want the minds of the youth to be infested with offensive and inappropriate behavior. Let this be a step in the right direction",4,4
3248,"No, I don't think books are offensive in librarys. Movies are a different kind of story if you child is under the age of eighteen they should not be renting a rated @CAPS1 movie, unless their parent approves of it.      This is one reason why our public library should not have rated @CAPS1 movies. While i was in our public library one afternoon I was looking at the movie selection, i was tring to decide which movie to chose. There was a little boy, at the age of nine or ten it looked liked to me, but he had two movies in his hand. They looked really good it was an action type movie, so i asked the boy if i could see the movie really fast. He asid yes, so i grabbed it from him and looked at the rating because from the title picture it looked gory. I noticed it was a rated @CAPS1 movie, and i told the boy did u know this is a rated @CAPS1 movie and he said yes, I was surprised his parents would let him watch movies like that, if i was his age i would never been able to.      My second reason why our public library should get rid of any kind of swimsuit magazines like @CAPS5 and/or @CAPS6 magazines. I was looking at the magazine rack one day and noticed magazines like @CAPS5,swimsuit magazines and many more. Do you think your children should not have seen any kind of magazines like that in our libray for the public to see. If a little girl went to the magazine rack and saw that magazine, she would either want to look at it or act like she not even noticed it. At her age she wants someone to look up to and if she sees a model on or in the magazine she would want to possibly look like her, so this is how eatting disorders start. This is the  reason why library's should get rid of any kind of magazines under that catagory.     These are the reason why I think our local library should get rid of rated @CAPS1 movies and/or Magazines like @CAPS5 and @CAPS6. If you agree with me contact your libray and tell them what i have told you today. @MONTH1 we put a stop to censorship in our librarys.",4,3
4018,"Conflicting works of art such as books, music, and movies, have always been seen in libraries. Whether it's @CAPS1 or @CAPS2 @CAPS3 @NUM1, someone is going to be offended. But whether or not these offending works should be banned is a common topic among authors, musicians, and movie-goers alike. I personally believe that all of these works have a right to be seen, heard, or read, because the creator has put much effort into stating their opinion and have a right to freedom of the press.         You could take any famous work and someone could be offended @CAPS5 it because it displays something contrary to their beliefs. But this does not mean that that work should be banned! Banning a book would mean total rejection to the author's thoughts and opinions, and everyone has a right to those. The censorship of any work is unconstitutional because as citizens of the @LOCATION1 we have total freedom of the press. You simply can't apply censorship because whether you keep it on the shelves or not, people are going to be offended. Also, as shown in @PERSON1's @CAPS4 @NUM2, the censorship of books could lead to a society unable to have a real knowledge of the past and the feelings and thoughts of the people of that age.      To me, 'offensive' books, movies, and music are not bad, they are merely a stimulant for debate. They can allow you, rather than just the author, to express your feelings on what was presented in the works. But to completely remove the cometition of the debate would be sabotage. @PERSON2 @LOCATION1 that 'if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf...then you also have exactly the same right and so does everybody else.' @CAPS5 saying this she is expressing that if we all could go into a library and remove the books, magazines, movies, or music that we do not like, then there would be absolutely nothing left. Every work would be remove because at least one person is offended @CAPS5 every work of the sort. Therefore, to allow books to be read, music listened to, and movies watched is to allow everyone the freedom of writing down their thoughts or stances.      The censorship of any work, anywhere, is allowing for the 'shutting up' of ideas. These ideas are the ones that keep society going @CAPS5 making us think and helping to formulate our opinions. @CAPS5 allowing this we are creating future generations of great thinkers. In this case, @CAPS5 keeping books, magazines, and music on the shelves, we can continue to 'learn from the past' and utilize the information and ideas that have been used throughout history",4,4
3629,"People from all over the world have many different opinions. If someone doesnt like something they do have the choice of not looking at it. Therefore, I believe that when you find something in a library that comes offencive to you you should not be able to remove it.     One main reason why I feel that the offensive things shouldent be taken out of the libraries is because, not everyone @MONTH1 feel the book, movie, magizine, or music is offencive. People have their own opinions on everything, and if someone takes out a book or any thing in the library because they feel its bad, the other person is going to miss out on something they like to read.     Another reason I feel the bad things shouldent be taken out of the library is because, some people could get mad at another person for taking all the offencive things out of the library. Many people like the offencive things in books, movies and soforth. I think from my own prospective that I like having a little bad in my life and if reading a book, watching a movie, listening to music, or even reading a magizine is what it takes I want to be able to go to a library and pick out something good with out haveing to worry if its there or not.     In my own opinion, I believe that with out offencive remarks or words there wouldnt be any humor in books and stuff today. Just because the offencive things seem rude and unapproite doesn't mean that they are. It's just something said to make a book or anything interesting and funny.     Although some offincive things in libraries can seem too unapproiate, I believe that if they're there then obviously there not too bad, and they shouldnt be taken out because one person feels that its not something that belongs in a library. Everyone has there own opinions in life and sometimes keeping them to yourself is the best thing to do.",4,4
4451,"In my opinion, books that @MONTH1 seem offensive to someone should be kept on the shelf. Meaning that people should be allowed to check them out in the library and read them even if some people think those books in particular are offensive, or @MONTH1 come off as offensive.      A person should be able to read an article without feeling like somone wrote that book, article, or magazine to be offensive. Yes, but at the same time it is up to you, the reader, to pick a book that does and will not make you feel uncomfortable. Do not pick a book to read that discriminates against football players if you are a football player, because most likely it is going to upset you, or make you uncomfortable. Well say you want to read a book that discriminates against football players, and it does make you feel uncomfortable, do not take the book, and go complain to someone about how the book, or article makes you feel if you picked it out to begin with. If it makes you uncomfortable, put the book, or article down. No one is forcing you to read it or look at it.      People should be allowed to read whatever type of books they would like, and about anything that interests them. Just because an article, or book is offensive to you, does not mean it is offensive to other people. If we were to take all the books, articles, magazines off the shelfs of library's there would not be any books left for us to read because every book written offends at least one person.      Movies are a whole other issue in itself. There are many types of movies, and within those types of movies are types of things people do in the movies to make it funny, scary, shocking, stupid, etc. If you do not cuss and say you go watch '@CAPS1 @CAPS2' you are going to find it offensive because every other word they say is a cuss word. If you do not like @CAPS4 people jump out of strange places and scare the crap out of you, then you are not going to watch '@CAPS3.' @CAPS4 people find movies offensive or not to their liking the usually go and try to make a big deal out of it, and sue the people who made the movie. You doing that is causing more trouble than it is actually worth. The same thing with movies as books, if we were to take all the movies out of movie stores, and just stores in general that were offensive to at least one person in any way, we would not have any movies left to watch because at the end of the day; there are tons of movies that would offend some people, and make them uncomfortable.      In conclusion, if you find a movie, song, book, article, or magazine that is offensive to you, get over it. Keep that book or whatever it is out of your reach and in other peoples, because at the end of the day no one is going to help you sue an author, producer, or music production company because something they wrote, directed, or sung offends you. In my opinion you should just read what interests you, watch what you like, and listen to the songs you usually listen to",4,4
4172,"The idea of censoring books and music in our libraries has long been debated. Libraries are places that people can go to stray away from the norm and get lost in the works of other authors and musicians. I believe that reading and the ability to express oneself through the powers of music is a very essential part of our lives. Censoring these would only shelter our lives and keep younger generations from discovering the effect that words have on our emotions and actions from day to day.      Books are one of the oldest forms of information we've had throughout the years. I think that if someone were to remove a piece of information that they found offensive it would only open the door to other people to find excuses to keep the hard work of authors behind closed doors.     Personally i enjoy reading. I think that with every book i read it opens the door to other beliefs and culturs that i would otherwise never learn about. Children need to be able to explore the world, to get to know how other civilizations grow and function as to how we in the @LOCATION1 function in our own little world that is getting more and more judgemental every day. The only way to do this is to pick up a book from someone who has been lucky enough to experience it themselves.     I have always had a deep passion for music. When i want to relax music helps me to center myself and open my mind. In my opinion, censoring music shouldn't be something that people even consider. Removing music from libraries is difficult for me to even begin to try and accept.      Freedom of speech was once a huge part of our country. Now it seems as if everything we've been taught of our great @LOCATION2 has been nothing more than just a false cover to let the government control how we live, act, and now how we choose to express ourselves. Music is a freeing way to express oneself in a not so violent way. During the sixties and seventies, music was the way alot of people protested things like war and racism without being violent. Times have changed though and the people in charge of our country no longer see it as an 'appropriate' option.      I belive that just because one society believes something to be inappropriate, doesn't mean that it actually is that way. We worry enough already about what other people think, why try to judge others' work if we can't accept the fact that we are all different. If we all accepted the differences in our world's cultures, there wouldn't have to be a debate on whether or not to censor an expressive and emotional piece of art that deserves to be shown in our libraries",4,4
3418,"Dear @CAPS1 @CAPS2,     I strongly agree that certain materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. There are young chirlderen that will pick up a book, movie and/or @CAPS3 case, or even a magazine and read off whatever the front says. We @CAPS5't need younger childeren reading off whatever they know what to say. @CAPS7's already bad enough that they hear @CAPS7 from family members or @CAPS2 near them. The seller could also make an edited verison of the book, movie, @CAPS3, or magazine.      The sayings,'You @CAPS5't like @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't look.','@CAPS5't got anything nice to say, than @CAPS5't say anything at all.',and 'If you wouldn't want to hear @CAPS7, than @CAPS5't say @CAPS7.',strongly apply to this. The way this world is coming to, @CAPS7 seems like they @CAPS5't really mind who sees their product, as long as @CAPS2 are buying their product.     Now a days, @CAPS7 seems like the younger the child is, the smarter @CAPS7'll be. If a four-year-old picked up a @PERSON1 @CAPS3 case, saw a pretty much naked grown adult on the case doesn't put a good thought in their head. That child's gonna grow thinking, '@CAPS7's okay to be naked. @PERSON1 did @CAPS7. Why can't I?'. Childeren learn more things from family and freiends, before they start learning the truth in school.        @CAPS7's just like you wouldn't want to take your child to the @CAPS8 @CAPS9, half naked to naked woman just walking around freely. Not something a little five-year-old needs to see. Just like a little five-year-old doesn't need to hear cussing or using the @CAPS10 name in vien.     Having young childeren see, hear, say, think, or read things like that puts thoughts in their heads, making them think @CAPS7's okay to say whatever you want or to dress however they want, while they think @CAPS7's perfectly natural. Although, this @MONTH1 seem like a huge wake up call to some parents, but @CAPS7's not normal. @CAPS7's not more normal than telling your kids that they were a mistake. Things like that shouldn't be said to/ near childeren.      Every parent wants the best for their child, they @CAPS5't want their childeren growing up in world that is full of bad nor do they want their childeren doing wrong. By letting companies sell their prodcut with half naked @CAPS2 on the front cover of a magazine or @CAPS3 case, or by selling books that talk about murding someone, hiding the body, and prays to @CAPS12 that they @CAPS5't get caught, or by playing music that is offensive in stores with younger kids, let's them think that they can sell whatever they want, promote their music where ever they want, makes the companies win.      I'm not a mother, nor am I soon-to-be-a-mother, but I find @CAPS7 highly offensive that companies and stores would do that. i wouldn't want my child looking at a magazine than asking me questions about the @CAPS2 nearly naked, or have them ask me what a word means when @CAPS7's a cuss word. I certainly wouldn't buy a book that just looks strange or offensive to my child.      As well, I strongly do believe in '@CAPS13 of @CAPS14', so the companies, in a way, do have a right to sell their product how @CAPS7 is. Just, if they really wanted to selll their product that much, that bad, than they should sell @CAPS7 online. @CAPS7 @MONTH1 cost more, but at least everyone would know that their childeren wouldn't see @CAPS7. Although, once you owned @CAPS7, than @CAPS7's the buyers fault if their child saw @CAPS7. That would be on the parents plate to deal with.      Another thing with childeren, is that their brain is still developmenting at that young age, their imagintion is beyond fairy tale world, @CAPS7's kinda like their second home, only @CAPS7's inside their brain. Their brain is still developmenting and learning new things each and everyday. Once they go to the store with their parent (s), they're already jumping up and down off the walls for a new toy or a new pair of shoses, or just because they wanna run up and down the alies, @CAPS7's bad enough having them see something inopporty.      I know I wouldn't let my childeren see things like those and I'm about @PERCENT1 certain you wouldn't want your childeren seeing those things. So, for the childeren's sake, think of them, their minds, and their developmenting brains and their off the wall imagaintion. Treat the childeren how you were treated growing up.                                   Thank You,                                   @PERSON2",5,5
4242,"We as @CAPS1 have the right to say what we want, and do as long as it is within the laws. If they take away some books because they are racey or because some people find them wrong, then they are saying we shouldn't learn the history of our civilization. A great man once said '@CAPS2 who do not learn from the past are condemed to repeat it.' @CAPS3 is saying that if we take away the books that are even obscured we are taking that history away from our children and they will do the same mistakes that we have done in our lifes.     Taking away the content that is obsene will make our children unknowledgable to the fact that it happened or how the past really was. '@CAPS4 @CAPS5's @CAPS6' is under critism because it uses the '@CAPS7-word' alot in the text. There is no reason to change the book because that is how the people talked, back in the day, and how things were done. If they change the book they change history and they take away knowledge from the children of tomorrow that slavery was a harsh, harsh thing.     When I think of censorship in the library, I think of how the @ORGANIZATION1 is trying to change the past and how it is trying to nurf the childrens history of what really happened. Censorshiop should be on tv, movies, and music so the little kids dont see the wrong things to earl, but when it comes to lititure in the library they shouldn't do it at all because only the liturate people will know what it means and what the text is actually saying. There should not be a censhorship in the lititure of the past, the present, and the future.",3,4
4119,"I feel that books, music, movies, and magazines should not be removed from shelves. Just because some one @MONTH1 finds them offensive. They only become offensive when people think they are.     I feel this way because no one is forcing any ony to watch or read any thing they dont want to. No one is telling sudents what they can and can't watch or read. Every one has the choice. To choose what they want to read or watch.      what one person @MONTH1 find offensive and wrang. Another person. @MONTH1 find interesting and exiting. I have felt the same way before, but that still gives me no resone to take it off the shelf. The next person after me. Has as much the same right as I did. The person has the right to watch or read what I have. To like or hate what ever is on the shelves.     There are lots of things in a @CAPS5. Other than things that people @MONTH1 find offensive. There are scary books like '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON2. There are mistury books like 'The @ORGANIZATION1.' @CAPS3 another @ORGANIZATION2 best selling auther, @PERSON1.     So to some up my esay. Nothing sould be taken off @CAPS5 shelves.

4607,"Do yo think censorship is a good thing? Do you think libraries should take more responsability on what they offer to people? Many people think they should. But I disagree, if they dont want to learn about that topic than don't read the book.          Public libraries are a great help for the community. They are reallly helpful for children who dont have certain materials at home. Libraries do think about what information children view. That is why there are restricted areas for children of certain age. Also its not always about what the library displays, but also about the parents who let their kids read things they are not supposed to read. If to some people some information is offensive, to others it might not. People will always have different points of view.           This materials cannot be removed, they might be important in some  points of our lifes. All information is helpful in some way. The inmense ammount of knowledge our libraries have should not be taken away just because someone want to",3,3
4206,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,      I believe that the country should take off all the books, movies, magazines, and music that has any kind of offensive cover, or any offensive mind grabbing, sexal contact in any of the  story, music, etc. Children don't need to be seeing that stuff just sitten around, the radio for example, the music that they put on like rap, hip-hop with all the cusin and singing about mony, cars, girls, and sex. Kids don't need to be hearing that stuff on the radio, and adalt books that are sitten around in @ORGANIZATION1 ready to be read by adalts, not children.The children need to know about all the sexual conflict some day just not when there @NUM1 or @NUM2 years old looking at pornograghic magazines, and movies. So I hope you keep this in mind get that stuff off the streets and not into childrens hands.",3,2
3795,"In the quote that @PERSON1 wrote she talks about how books can be taken down from a shelf if it is too provokative.  This is a very interesting quote.  She talks about how things should be taken of the shelf to prevent the children from seeing it.  In everyday life there are things that are said in movies, music, and magazines that kids should never watch, hear or read.      Some movies can be way too provokative.  Directors try and cover them up, but we know what they are trying to get across.  Some scenes can get out of control and there is no stopping it.  People wish they could close their eyes and it would all be over.  When parents get movies they try and keep those scenes hidden from their children.  The parents do not want to get their child having bad ideas of what the movies are saying.  To many children take the movies to the extreme and try and act like the actors or actresses, and the children end up getting hurt from these actions.     Music is especially one to do this.  There are not a lot of  songs in the world that do not involve language, drugs, or sexual content in it.  Many parents do not want them to be exeposed to that way to soon.  If people listen to this they might want to try it and end up going down a wrong path from these words that are said.  Mothers do not want to go get their child out of jail from doing something that was just like the song they like to listen to.  That is not a mothers dream to go and do that.     There are too many magazines that try and expose women.  They use this to try and see more magazines.  This is wrong to do.  A little while back a magazine took pictures of a girl and tried to expose her, this is just wrong.  Parents do not want their children to look at this and get the wrong idea.  When girls look at a model in a magazine they try and be just like the model.  They girls end up being underweight, sick, and maybe do drugs.  Parents if they see this should take the magazine away from them if it is not what they approve.          Some parents let their kids get away with too much.  They should censor what their children do.  Some kids will try and get around them so there is not helping them.  Everyones point of view is different.  People @MONTH1 think that this scene is to provocative and another person @MONTH1 look at that and say there is nothing wrong.  It just depends on how society feels about the whole situation.  If we were to take a movie or music down because of what they say then there would be no contents on the shelf",4,4
4503,"Should libraries be more careful about what they put out in their place of establishment? Of course they should. Libraries have all kinds of people walking in and out everyday. Certain rated material should be put in certain spots for certain people. The library should be more strict on the material that the people in the library look at on a day to day basis. Libraries need to become a little more organized.     Libraries have people that come in and out of the library everyday. People of all different ages and anyone is welcome to come in the library. With that being said, children of all ages come into the library all the time and pick all kinds of material. Children of course can't read everything in the library. They have to stay within their appropriate rated material selection. So if the library is more censored and strict about the material children can't get their hands on the material that they shouldn't be seeing at that time in their lives. You would want your seven year old child seeing inappropriate or offensive material, right.      Libraries should put the material that for adults eyes only in one completely different section of the library than what they would want the children that come to the library to see. With doing that it decreases the chances of the children getting a hold of material that they should see. Also, some books that the library think that some children should be able to see just might be offinsive to another set of people and wouldn't want their children to see. So books @MONTH1 show racism, or maybe another kind of discrimination and it @MONTH1 not be the goal of the book to make that suggestion but it still is in the book and in the wrong hands it can be a very bad thing especially in some childrens minds.      The libraries really need to just stop and think for a second is this book really appropriate for this age group or even for this establishment. Libraries have become where children are just checking out books by themselves and to me thats a problem. I think that children need a parents concent to check out a book from a library but do the libraries care, no. Library @MONTH1 check their inventory and notice a book @MONTH1 be missing but guess what, by that time its already to late. Children are able to just walk right out with books these days and know one will even think that they just took a book without checking it out. When children find a piece of material in a library and they know they aren't suppose to have it and they know they cant get out of the library with it they might decide to just take the book. The sercurity wont think twice to check the child and what is the result the childs mind is corrupted. Guess what you can blame it on the though the library. Isen't that something the child got the material from your friendly neighborhood library.     Oranization is the key. Libraries need to orginize their material better, plane and simple. It's really not that hard. They need to review the content that thier putting on the shelves in their establishment. I feel that the people at the library are lazy personally. If they just gave a little more effort maybe the children wouldn't get their hand on material that they have no buisness getting a hold of. Just pay attention to whats going on in the library. Their are books everywhere, right. Their are children, correct. The children @MONTH1 be in their appropriate rated section of the library but maybe a book from the adult section of the library stumbled over there by accident. Though it was an accident it still happened and it can be prevented and it should be prevented for the sake of the children. All we need is a little more organization.     As you can see from the following libraries just don't about our children as much as we do. It's okay that everyone is welcome in the library no questions asked but, they people need to stay in the designated place in the library. Children shouldn't be allowed in the adult section for saftey. Also a book from the adult side shouldn't be in the childrens section because anything can happen and corruption will rise. We need stricter libraries. Better sercurity to what they children are looking at and where the material is. Also the library really needs to look at the material and decide if it is appropriate for all the readers that @MONTH1 look at the material. Organization is the key to all our worries, if we use a bit more effort this won't be a problem anymore.",4,4
4217,"Censorship is the most foul and terrifying part of society.  Our lives have been taken over by politcal correctness, so much so that our voices are no longer our own.  Until recently we had the freedom to convey our thoughts, no matter what those thoughts were, in any form of media.  But now if something is found to be offensive in any way it is essentially burned.  Censorship limits our freedoms, takes away our @CAPS2 as citizens and people, shields us from the truths of the world, and limits the knowledge we can take from, as well as ensuring that one day there will be nothing left of media.     The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2, the document that our country lives by, says that we as people have the right of free speech.  Censorship actively and violently violates that right.  Our country was built on free speech, and now it is being taken away.  Our own words forced down our throats, never allowed to come out.  Censorship ensures that no opinions will be heard, that no one's beliefs will be questioned, that no one can assume or think for themselves.  Is this not what we are supposedly guaranteed by freedom of speech?  We are supposed to be able to say anything we want to say.  We know there are consequences for saying certain things, but we are supposed to be allowed to say them.  Letting our own ideas into the world allows for new ideas to form.  Arguements come, but these arguements allow people to see other ideas that they hadn't thought of and look at issues from new perspectives.  We are able to see our world through different eyes when we hear or read someone else's opinions.  And from there we can form our own opinions, allowing our world to be rich with iddeas and knowledge, and allowing our society to advance.  But censorship wants to take this all away from us in order to please everyone.  But there will always be someone who is unhappy.  It's the inevitable truth.     Censorship is trying to shield us from the ugliness of this world.  In a way this makes sense.  We don't want our children to understand the atrocities that happen in everyday life.  We don't want them knowing what's happening behind closed doors.  However, if we don't allow people to open these doors, they can never understand the world or be prepared for the experiences that are to come.  Learning the harsh realities of our society educates people, allowing them to stop these realities as well as be prepared for when they happen to them.  For example, let's look at the issue of rape.  Rape is a horrible thing, but it happens.  It is a nasty part of reality.  Rape can be censored from books, televsion, and other forms of media.  We can walk around pretending rape doesn't exist.  But that doesn't accomplish anything.  That doesn't get rid of rape.  It still exists.  And if the people are uneducated on the issue of rape, how will it ever stop?  How will a rape ever be able to be prevented?  How will someone know what to expect or what to do?  By censoring rape from media, we are ensuring that the people in future generations never learn about rape.  Knowledge of rape is important if it is ever going to be stopped.  Pretending something doesn't exist doesn't get rid of it.  Censorship is supposed to protect the people, but it doesn't.  It hurts the people, cutting off their access to knowledge.     We as people need knowledge.  We live off of knowledge.  And the way we obtain this knowledge is through media.  Censorship takes away pieces of knowledge gradually.  It @MONTH1 not seem like a lot is missing now, but as time goes on the gap will increase, and more knowledge will be taken from our grasp.  Is this fair?  Is this right?  Is this helping us?  How does cutting out knowledge ever help?  It brings us backwards in time, makes us fear.  It is human nature to fear the unknown.  The more that becomes unknown, the more we have to fear.  Censorship is taking away crucial pieces of knowledge that we must understand to get along in society.  This is wrong and immoral.  It is unfair, if nothing else.  We should be allowed to take from any knowledge that exists.  No good comes from hiding it.     Lastly, this gradual burning of knowledge is affecting society in horrid ways.  And as time goes on it can only get worse.  Censorship is based off of offensiveness.  If something could be offensive, it is disposed of.  However, everything that exists in society could be offensive to someone.  Therefore everything and everyone should be censored in order to fulfill the goal of censorship.  This means all media of any kind should be destroyed.  No one should say anything.  The world would be forced to be silent.  All knowledge would be taken away.  Chaos would ensue.  The people's freedom would be completely taken away.  The freedom to know would vaporize right in front of their eyes.  This is our future if we allow the censorship to continue.  We cannot allow our lives to be taken over by censorship.  Yes, people's feelings will be hurt, but we cannot rid our world of ideas and knowledge purely to spare feelings.  These ideas and knowledge are too important to let censorship take away.     Censorship is taking away our freedoms and @CAPS2, slowly stealing them away from us.  It also tries to shield us from reality, but instead hurts us, ensuring that we will never understand our world and never be able to stop the very things that are being censored.  Censorship is affecting society, ensuring that our freedoms are to be taken away.  All knowledge will be trashed and no one will be able to voice their opinions.  A very dark future waits for us if censorship continues.  Only by helping people to understand censorship and the wrong it does to society can we gain back our freedom of speech; the freedom we are supposedly guaranteed, but censorship is desperately trying to take away.",6,6
3263,"Censorship of @CAPS1 of @CAPS2            'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf -- that work I abhor -- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us,' is a quote from Author, Katherine Paterson. She is saying that there are some books that most people would think to be a little graphic or shocking, but we can not take those books off the shelf because then eventually there would be no books left to read. I agree with her in the sense that we can not take certain books off the shelves in our library. We can not take them off the shelves because that would be taboo in many ways. It would be stepping into hot water because the people would be violating the authors freedom of the press, who would decide what material was right and wrong, and how far is too far when it comes to censorship. These are just a few of the many reasons this is wrong.     Taking certain books of shelves would be against our constitution. The @CAPS3 @CAPS4 gives all @CAPS5 citizens the freedom of the press. This means that they can write anything that they want without having to worry about the government's or the citizens' opinions. If we start taking certain books off shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 include a few controversial things we are violating there natural right. Which leads me to my next argument in if we do allow censorship, who should be in charge?     So many people want to include their opinions on what is right and what is wrong. So, who are we supposed to believe? On person @MONTH1 think somthing is out of line, but the person standing next to them would think it is ordinary. That is what makes this country great. We are a mixture of many different ideas that work together for a common goal. If the government would assign someone to censoring books, magazines, or music, there would be a uproar. How can one person say if something is wrong? And if someone was allowed to censor things, what would be included? How far is to far?     This is a hard question to ask. If we were to allow one person to judge things what should be included? Would the judgement stop at just books, movies, and music? Or would it expand to judgement of clothes and lifestyles? If we implement this system of censorship, our who lives would become one big judgement. Self expression would go out the window because people would be scared of being deemed 'inapropriate.' Our world would become a puzzle of trying to fit in and to not be noticed, rather than standing out and pushing the human race forward.     There are always going to be those people who disagree with things. They find it out of place or offensive. What we have to realize is that everyone views things in different ways. We as people need to learn to accept something out of the ordinary, and try to understand where otheres are comming from. If we can do that our world would be a much better place",4,4
3882,"There are a bunch of very good book sat a public libary, you can get all kinds of different types of books. You are get a book on anything you really need, any facts you need to know or anything you want to know how to do, I'm sure there is a book out there that can help you out. Just because a book is an opion dont mean it needs to be taking off shelves. Everone looks at everything differently.     If you read it can help you in many different ways, you can learn alot just from reading a book. Me personally i hate reading, so i dont learn much. I'm more of a hands on type of person, words just fly through one ear and out the other really. It is really have to understand when im trying to read and listen or write an listen i lose my thoughts to easily",3,2
4241,"Censorship in libraries? Is it a problem? Should we fix this 'problem' or is it for the good? People of different culture, background, and life could be profound by these articles in readings. Can these books be offensive? They could be offensive to some but to others only educational. Statements have been made all over the world of people speaking on what they believe is right or wrong. How many people believe that censorship in libraries is really offensive and should be removed from libraries?     Who really are the victims when books and magazines are being thrown off the shelves? The author of that specific article that's who. If it is said that every reading that comes off offensive should be taken off the shelves, then what would be left on them. Some people @MONTH1 take romances being offensive or comedy or horror. Romance could be hurtful to someone only because they maybe just got out of an relationship, or comedy because they are miserable and don't know how to laugh anymore or know what happiness is. Who knows? Opinions such as these would be only terrible for business but also terrible for the educational and history part of life itself.           People of different races and cultures @MONTH1 have another opinion on the situation of censorship. From all over the world there are cultures spreading throughout. Born into a religion could be a huge affect on what their outcome is on a book, magazine, or a movie. Movies of past experiences or massacres that happened to a cultrue @MONTH1 be difficult for some people of that culture to take in. The normal response to a movie such as that would be to become angry or frustrated. Only for others it is an oppertunity to learn what those people went through and grieve for the loss of the people during that time. To support the people who made it through those heart breaking times and become a friend to them and learn more about them, their culture, and way of life.      Have you seen protests arouse before you? Anywhere in the world? On television, hear it on the radio, or see it in the newspaper. Everyone has most likely seen this type of protest or attack on the opinion of another person. There have been protest in the past of the freedoms of a person or even race. If everyone begins to complain and argue of what is being put on shelves in libraries. What will come of our world? What will we know about the past? What will we begin to predict for the future? Anyone, and even I can make observations of the acts going on around us. In my experience, I have seen of attacks being struck upon people who only put a picture in the newspaper, or a small article spoke out on television. Who are we to say that everything needs to be removed off the shelves in libraries? These are just people who have been hurt and don't want to relive that experience.      Overall, my opinion on if censorship in libraries should be extinguished. I believe the answer is no, every person in the world is going to be upset, hurt, or broken about something at least a million times in their life time from now on. Whether it be in books, music, movies, magazines, or anything else. They just need to understand that without any one person's culture that there would be no history of life before us",4,4
3450,"While their are many books written out thier @MONTH1 offened many types of people thier are some that just need to be wipped off the face of the earth, those who do not learn from history, are doomed to repeat it. That is one of my favorite quotes and i don't use it lightly. Take from example 'The @ORGANIZATION1' the very book that gives instructions to build bombs, teaches you how to use firearms etc. this book is all about hate amongst people we don't fully understand like thier religion and how they look. This book frankly makes me sick to the stomach. Thats why i think this book needs to be taken of the shelves for good, thier was alos hate properganda in the books about how the @CAPS1 shouldn't be alive and that's disgusting i would be able to sleep better at night knowing this book was gone.     One other book that should be taken off the shelves is a book written by none other than one other @PERSON1 the man that put so many people into gas chambers and many others to thier undeserved graves. He sent men, women, and childeren to his many death camps and work camps. One of those many childern was @PERSON2 who was in hiding from the gustappo or '@CAPS2 @CAPS3'. Because of this monster the @CAPS7 lost one of the worlds greatest and most deappest writers for the @DATE1's. This book was filled with hate messages and how the @CAPS4 people shouldn't be allowed to live amongst the 'supposed' @CAPS5 @CAPS6 @CAPS7. But if we did no have this book we would be sure to expect another @CAPS8 on our hands.     All in all censorship in the libraries should be a rule but to only the books worth keeping not these horrific Books",3,3
4068,"Dear Newspaper @CAPS1,    I've recently finish reading a quote of the great author, Katherine Paterson, and her feelings towards the certain type of material use in books. For example some @CAPS1 @MONTH1 be offended be certain type of language used in books. Other @MONTH1 just feel the pictures are not quite approprite. With that being said, I believe that if there's a certain material presented in a book that you feel uncomfortable with, you should just pick up another book instead.      My beliefe is that many authors feel like a book is a place where they can write their thoughts and beliefs about things that happen in this world. Authors shouldn't be denied the oppertunity to write a book just because of the way they express their feelings. @CAPS1 shouldn't be allow to give hateful opion just because they didn't like a book. As I see it no one is forcing them to read it.       Now I'm not saying I'm a huge reading. As a matter of fact I barely read but when i do start reading I sometimes am eager to keep on reading. The way authors discribe things even with sometimes profanity is just amazing. You can actually feel that you're part of the book. Now then my point is that even though to many @CAPS1 a book @MONTH1 be horrible but to others it @MONTH1 be the best book in the world.       So if you do start taking down books from the shelfs you would ended up with nothing but a huge, empty shelf. There's no book out there that is what we would consider, ' The perfect book.' @CAPS2 book can be given a nasty comment but then again @CAPS2 book can also be given the best comments.       This world is to big to start picking and choosing. My beliefs won't be the same as yours but this is how i feel and this is how i will keep on feeling. So tell me, what's your belief then?",3,3
3005,I think if people find books offensive they should not even read that book to begin with. If books are found offensive and taken from shelves then book shelves would be emtpy. Then their would nothing left for people to read.     Some of the greatest authors use offensive words in their books take them off th shelves and you will be getting rid of the greatest material. @PERSON1 @CAPS1 for example in the book '@CAPS2' its offensive to gays and one gets killed.,2,2
4419,"To whom it @MONTH1 concern,     Censorship is an issue that has plagued our society for centuries. It is not only unnecessary, but unconstitutional. As @CAPS1, we have certain @ORGANIZATION1 that we are guarenteed by the documents that keep our society out of anarchy. If the right to pick what liturature to read, watch, or listen to is taken away, where will that put our country? Censorship should by no means be allowed in our country today.     In the @CAPS2, the @CAPS3, and the @ORGANIZATION1, we are given certain @ORGANIZATION1. Some of these @ORGANIZATION1, including freedom of speech and freedom of the press, have already been contricted, which is 'wrong' in the eyes of the government, but nevertheless, it is taking place. We @MONTH1 not have 'lost' these @ORGANIZATION1, but they have definitely been constricted. Why should the government be able to tell us what to read? If censorship is allowed, what is to come is frightening. If our government, which is supposed to be 'for the people' tells us what we can read and not read, what is going to stop them from telling us what to wear, drink, or even eat?     Censorship in libraries is one of our biggest issues. There are countless examples on why censorship of written liturature should not be allowed. For instance, if a college student is writting a research paper about the effects of rape on a child, but the government sees rape as 'too graphic', what is this student to do? He or she should be given the right to use what materials are necessary to write a fully-informed paper. But by censoring our libraries, and taking books out, the government is hindering the education of it's countries youth.     Some @CAPS4 classics are also being speculated against. The @CAPS5 of @PERSON2 has been known as a classic since it was written. It is used in classrooms everywhere around the country for education. But recently, the availability of the book has been questioned. Throughout the novel, the 'n-word' is used, but never as an insult. During the time-period of its writing, this word was more common, and had a much less severe meaning than it does in modern day societies. But because time has changed it's meaning, it is being removed from libraries and curriculums across the country. This is unlawful censorship. One of the greatest books of our time, an @CAPS4 classic, is being removed from the lives of our youth because of 'racy language'.     Censorship is not only taking place in written liturature. Movies and music are also under the magnifying glass of censorship. Movies are rated for a reason, to give the viewers an age group for which the movie is appropriate. This is helpful to parents to be able to self-censor their children. But it is not up the the government to be able to choose what a specific child is able to view. It is a parents right to be able to expose or not expose their child to whatever they see fit, not that of our country's lawmakers.     Music is one of the biggest part of our society today. With the invention of iPods and @NUM1 devices, music has become much more common, and portable. Censorship is becoming more severe with the change of music style. The music styles of modern teenagers greatly differs from that of their grandparents. Almost nothing is seen as unacceptable by many of today's rappers, as displayed in their choice of lyrics. The music business is taking quite a beating for what has become the most popular. With the most common themes of sex, drugs, and money, it @MONTH1 seem offensive to some citizens, but others @MONTH1 just shrug it off as a normalcy. So how can someone say 'No, you @MONTH1 not listen to that,'? This should not be allowed, yet it is.     How can one person, or a group of people decide what is acceptable and what is not? They cannot. Censorship is morally wrong, as well as lawfully wrong. Taking the media from its citizens, such as books, movies, and music, is unconstitutional. What would our forefathers think of what censorship has become? Before you pull that 'unacceptable' book off the shelf, remember the @ORGANIZATION1 of our great countries citizens, and the @ORGANIZATION1 of individuals like yourself.

4440,"Imagine a world where nearly every other book is banned for some reason or another. That world is not a world I want to live in. I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong. For three reasons, really, the first being that people have the right to any information that they desire to have. The second, people do not have the power to take opportunities away from other people. The last point I will make is that no information is bad information.     Because we are in @LOCATION1, I asume that we are talking about censorship in @CAPS1 libraries. If that is the case, then I think that it is unconstituitional to ban any book, or censor any material. Censoring books is like putting a blind fold on whoever is reading the material; they don't see it for what it really is, or for what the intended purpose is.     If the prompt does happen to be including foreign countries, then I think humans do not have the right to influence what other people read. This is idealistic, yes, and in a perfect world, all countires would have equal rights for everyone, regardless of race or gender. I think that people should see everything the way it is. If something is offensive, it's offensive. It's the person's choice whether or not they read or listen.     That leads me to my last point, that no information can be bad information. Whether it is profane, or offensive in any way, there is always some kind of meaning behind it. From rappers like @PERSON2 and @CAPS2 @CAPS3, who I've found all of their songs have meaning, whether it's personal, or they are trying to send a message out to the people. There are books like @CAPS4 for @LOCATION2, by @ORGANIZATION1, which has recently been banned by some school libraries because of graphic scenes. The people who banned the book fail to realize that the book is not about those scenes. There is a much deeper message about guilt and grief, and redemption beneath it. Another, more famous book that was banned from school libraries is The @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6, by @PERSON1, which is a coming of age story about a boy.      In conclusion, I don not think it is right to ban books or music from libraries. No one has the right to.There is always meaning within. The way an author writes a story or a piece of music always has meaning; they made the conscious decision to write it that way for a reason. By banning books, they are taking people's chances to grow and expand.",4,4
4447,"There are all kinds of books, movies, and even magazines out there. Most libraries have a huge selection for all types of readers or people who would like to watch a movie. They could even have stuff that the young minds should not read. Have you ever thought about what would happen if a little kid grabbed onto something that he/she was not supposed to read? When it comes to things like this, there is a huge range of topics. Some of them are not supposed to be looked at until an older age. Thats why I think there should be a certain section where only a certain amount of ages are allowed to go.     When it comes to books, there will always be some books that are not apporbiate for the young mind. They could include multiple things that could scar a kid for life. Some of the things that they might read are probably things that their parents would like to talk to them about later on in the future. Books are great for learning, dont get me wrong, but there are some that are more adult related. Now there are a ton of books that kids can read and parents won't need to worry about them reading.     Another way libraries can help is put the movies in a certain section. The library could make a section called 'family and kids'. This section would hold a perfect spot where parents wouldn't have to worry about their kids getting the wrong ideas from movies. In our library, we have this section. My grandma and I would always go there and find an incredible family movie to watch together. Finding a great family movie to watch is the best feeling ever.     Finally the last way a library could help is by making sure the child is old enough to check out a book or a movie. Clearly a child of @NUM1 shouldn't check out a movie that is rated @CAPS1, thats just wrong. Libraries should make sure the child is at the correct age to check out the movie. Thats why the movie companys rate movies, so they can give people heads up about whats good and bad about the movie. Also the libraries should make sure a kid is checking out the apporbiate type of magazine or book. The people that work there could look through it before and make sure its the right type of book they should read. There are an infinte amount of ways we can protect the minds of young ones.     I dont think libraries should banned books, magazines, movies, or even music. I think they should just make sure the kids are checking out what their allowed to read. Books are a great way to learn things, but they should be learning about the stuff that is sustable for their age. Libraries are there for us to learn and enjoy ourselves. I believe people would get upset if they would banned the stuff they love. They should just keep an eye out of what kids are looking at. Thank you for your time.",3,3
2999,"I think that books, magazines, papers etc shouldn't be removed from the librarys because some @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 them. Some @CAPS1 feel that reading a book about there problem will help them get through what ever problem they are having. @CAPS1 often say that they are stressed and depressed. Those @CAPS1 can get the books and @CAPS2 them to help them solve there problems.     If the books etc are offensive then, the @CAPS1 who think they are shouldn't get them. The can't control what books are in the library. Some @CAPS1 have problems and some of the books can help them. Alot of @CAPS1 I know dont think that alot of books are offensive. Its eather they want to @CAPS2 them or they dont.      If @CAPS1 think that books etc are offensive they will just have to deal with it. @CAPS1 like to @CAPS2 all kinds of books and some dont even like to @CAPS2. For the @CAPS1 who like to @CAPS2 they can pick whatever book they want that they feel confortable with. If they think that a book is offensive they go past it and find a different book to @CAPS2.      I suppose if you find a offensive book you could go to the teacher or someone and talk about it. Im sure that they wont do anything about it. The books and other things are there for a reason, 'For @CAPS1 To @CAPS2', and to understand what there life is and how to fix it.      You have to control under the books. You can't tell them what books should be one the shelf and what cant be on the shelf. In conclusion I think that @CAPS1 should deal with it because they cant control it",3,3
4659,"'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf- that work I abhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' Katherine Paterson, an author, once said. I think that she was trying to tell us that some books should not be out on the shelves for children to read. I agree with her on that statement.     I have once read a book with very mature content. It was very vulgar and not sutable for my age or maturity. There are a lot of books like that out there and we need to hide them from the children of our society. They are too young to hear or read about adult actions such as: war, violence, sex, drugs, and all sorts of other things.     If we take these mature books and other types of media off the shelves our children will have better lives. There would be less teen pregancies, drug ussage, and multiple other factors that are effecting our society. Children would behave better because they would not be so greatly influenced by the media. I think that we shouldn't get rid of these book though. We should just keep them out of the libraries. If people want to read these kinds of books they should search elsewhere. An easy way to solve this problem is to put an age limit on books and media of this content and to put them in a separate store or section in the libraries.     A very great author said that children should not be exposed to adult content in the media. But she also said that the people who read or watch this type of media have every right to. This is why there needs to be an age limit on this type of media. But for now if the content is to adult for you or does not agree with you, don't read or watch it.",3,4
3884,"I do belive in censorship, but i do belive that it is not that big of a deal. It should the parants job to block materials that they think is bad for their kids. If it is to bad then it is the parants right to make sure that their kid does not see it.                  My point of view in stoping materials like books, music, movies, and magazines is that some things are not ment to be shown, read, and heard by someone of a yonger age unless they get the ok from their parents.     The views of censorship in my mind is that if someone see something they don't like they want to get rid of it and if is something to wrong then yes it should be censor, but if it could be avoided and is small like a word in a book then I say that people should be a little more understanding of it and try to think past it or try to find another path to take about it.     If you don't like something then maybe you should not read it or listen to it, and if is so bad don't let your kids get involved in it. I have never found a book and readed it and found it affensive or disterbing. I have found books that I don't like or are not good but never have I seen something so bad that I never want any one to read it.      If people are going to censor something I think it should be for a good reason not because they don't like the person or they think their idea is wrong, but for something that is bad about anetirer race or to graphic for a yonge age.     My point in censoring something in my mind is the right way to look at it we see it all the time in the real world people do something because they dont like some one they try some extreame things to get rid of some bad marerial, but in any case is a lot in this world that people should know about and when i do have kids I will decide wether to block something if I wont to and that is how it should be",3,3
3880,"Dear Newspaper:              @CAPS1, there should be censorship in libraries, but people should be a certain age just to check the book out. Some people go to the libraries just for censorship.          These days censorship basicly is how you get children or students just to pick up a book. Plus, if the parents aloud their child to read cebsorship books because they think it does no harm to the child which it don't. Put a @NUM1 and older section in the libraries so any and every body will not be able to enter unless they have @CAPS2 just to solve the age problem. However you do it the libraries will lose the little money they are getting from the people.          I no you think censorship should be taking off every shelf in the libraries, but they really shouldn't because I believe if you do that then the libraries will go out of business for good. That is the reason why the libraries should keep censorship on there selvies. I'm finish but I will leave you with this question: do you really want to take censorship out the libraries?",3,3
4326,"Library Censorship     Libraries shouldn't have 'offensive' books removed from shelves. Parent supervision, librarian supervision, and your own common sense are three of the reasons why books shouldn't be removed from shelves if they are considered to be offensive.     Parent supervision is one of the top priorities for knowing what your children read. If they don't want their children to grow up being 'stupid' then they should teach them to focus on educational books more. When they see their child in a row of books that they think is inappropriate, then they should remove their child from that area and take them to another area.     The librarian's supervision is also an important priority. Maybe they don't know the children's actual age, but if the librarian sees them in a place that they think is inappropriate for someone around their age, show them another book shelf. Just like parents, librarians will try to find an educational book that the child @MONTH1 enjoy. But, librarians obviously like to read since they are around books all day, so the child @MONTH1 be lucky and the librarian finds an adventure book for the child, or something else that the child finds interesting.     The person's common sense is also a reason why 'offensive' books shouldn't be removed from libraries. Most people know how old they are and what kind of books they should read. If they are in an area of the library that other people @MONTH1 think is inappropriate for them to read, go to a different area.     Once again, I don't think there should be a censorship in libraries. If parents want their children to read books that won't 'rot your brain' then they should observe what books their child reads, trust the librarian to show them the correct books to read, and expect their child to have good common sense",4,4
3270,"I think that censorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere. If you do not like something said or seen in some of the materials, then do not read or watch or listen to any of them. People have different tastes in what they like to listen to or watch or read about. Some people might like rap music but other might like rock music. People that like rock music might not like rap because of some of the languauge used in songs. This is why some people listen to other types of music and do not listen to the type of music that they find offensive. I like rock and metal music just because rap is a little offensive. I have had a lot of family members say that i shouldnt be listening to such music because of the language.     Some people say that reading certain things is a prefferance, but what if you are sitting in a doctors' office and you would like to read a magazine that is just sitting around. If you start going through the magazine and find something you do not like or take offense to, either keep flipping the pages or put the magazine down. You have to think to yourself that there are other people that enjoy or are interested in something you might find offensive. The best thing you can do is put it down and think to yourself that it is not directed towards you. Magazines can have all sorts of stuff hidden beyond the pages, but sometimes you have to look at the cover to see what some of the things that are written in the magazine. Sometimes this can help you decide on rather or not to read it.      Movies are always fun to watch no matter what occation. Some people like certain movies such as action, comedy, romance, or drama. Some people might not like action due to the fact that there is violence in almost all of those movies. Some might not like comedy because of some of the rude humor. There are just alot of types of movies out there and its not the producers fault that we do not like it. People make different movies because everyone is not alike. Some people might get offended by some of the contents of a movie and what you could do to help that is just by reading into the movies before seeing them. I think that cencorship should not matter in a library due to the fact that some of those books, magazines, music, and movies, are liked by different people everywhere.",3,3
3143,"To start, if any materials in the library such as books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive i believe that they should still remain on the shelves. This book or music @MONTH1 be offensive but everyone is intitled to their own opinon. People have all the freedom to read, listen or watch anything that is approperite to them. I believe it should all be up to the individual to chose what they should do with what @MONTH1 offend others.      Also from my own exprience i have read a book about @CAPS1 @CAPS2 in the stadges of our history where they were salves and were hung for their punishment. It @MONTH1 offend some that their local library having a book on such a terrible topic but it is found that it is part of history and others @MONTH1 find it interesting to go back a learn more information. It does not have to mean that they are rascist or trying to offend you they would just like to learn more about our history. Each person has had topics that offend them but the libraries can not make all happy. If you chose to pick a book, watch a movie, or listen to music that @MONTH1 offend someone then it shouldn't be removed, if you would like to read, watch or listen to anything that @MONTH1 offend someone then it should be up to you to decide what to do about it.        Therefore, i conclude that if any books, music, movies, or magazines are found offensive they should remain on the shelves. Everyone @MONTH1 have their own opinon or have their own ideals that offend them but it is our job to let those people choose their liking of anything open in our local libraries. It is for their own benifit, not for yours. It is up to you to decide wheather or not to come about the situation. Libraries should not be held responsable and have to removed anything open to the people that @MONTH1 just be part of our background",3,3
4163,"There a books, music, movies, magazines, and etc. that are not appropriate for children. Having them banned from shelves shouldnt even be a question, if children shouldnt read, watch, or listen to it then its the parents responsibility to make sure they dont.     I dont think they should take those kind of books, movies, or music off the shelves because what about teens that like them or grown ups also. There just gonna take them down for the children but lose buisiness from grown ups and teens. That doesnt make any sence at all. I think either the child should know what he or she can read, watch, or listen too, and if they cant then its up to the parent or a grown up around them to let them know what they can choose.     A way to solve the problem can be seperate those offensive books, music, or movies from ones that are appropriate for children. That would make everything alot easier so nothing comes off the shelves and knowone loses buissiness.",3,3
3834,"Bad @CAPS1      @CAPS2 off yes, I do think think they should be removed if they are bad. If you wouldn't say it to your parents face when your at a younger age then you don't need to be listening to it or reading it.     I would not want my younger kids reading or watching anything that they know they couldnt say to my face. There are so many things that little kids can see. Like at any @LOCATION1 or any where there are magazines with ladies in there bra and underwear and its the same thing with the guys. I dont think its right they should they them put up where it isn't so easy for the little ones to see. Those kind of things are justy going to get kids asking question that make the parents have to lie.     Then theres kids watching tv and they have the stupid cartoons where the kids are on there cusing and talking aboout sex then your kid goes to that channel when your not around hear all these stupid stuff. Then their going to go tell there friends what they heard because they think its cool then all kinds of kids are hearing it. When you can just take channels like that off your tv and make everything easier.      I think the worst is liking people sign about killing people and raping kids and all this and that. I would never let my kids listen to music like that i don't care how old they are. I also think that is where most of the stuff kids pick up are  from the music they want to listen to its horrible. I would do anything to make it where kids coudnt listen to that stuff until their parents didnt care. I know my parents didnt like me listening to it when I was young and I see why now that im older and know what all of it means so i'm never going to let my kids listen to it when they are at a young age.     In all that I hope that I made a good point and hope you feel the same way. Why let are kids listen to the stuff that hurts them and us in the longt run it just not worth the trouble letting them do what they want.",3,4
4407,"What do you think about them taking books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive? Everyone has a different look on it. It is an important thing to think about. Just stop and think do you want your child looking at that when you are not around? Many would say no, because they are to young to know about stuff that shows to much and other reasons also.Taking all the ones found offensive off the shelves would be the best idea for the case of young teens, and childern.     I believe that they should be taking off the shelves, and you have to be @NUM1 or older to buy them in many reason. The biggest reason I think they should is, kids under the age of @NUM1 want to look cool like the older teenagers, but really don't need to see that. With the young teenager think they need to do things like the stuff in music, movies, to be cool and think if they do that they @MONTH1 look cool. Young teenager don't think about what they are doing, and just think it ok because the older ones are doing it and they see it. With magazines, and movies, and music they need to be of age to buy. One big reason to believe that they should be taking off the shelves is because, a lot of kids and young teens thinks they can go in anywhere and look at things that are found offensive. There are a lot of different types, and you have to be of age to go into some places.With believing that they should take them off the shelves, it gives the @CAPS1 a fill free about your child to look at things without think about the offensive ones.     I hope with reading my persuasive essay, I hope i relate to someone about the books, music, movies, and magazines that are offensive can relize what i'm talking about with young teens around the ages of @NUM3 and if you take your child with you and they see something like that. With the a stuff  I gave you it helps you see the out look on stuff that is offensive on the shelves",3,3
4107,"The libraries have to worrie about enough as it is with people not retuning books and stuff in. They do not want to lose there books, music, movies, magazines just because some people find the offensive. Why would we have to talk something out that offens one person but no one else has complainded about it being offensive. I know that you are asking me to thank like you to be able to see why it is offensive but i dont see how a book is going to be offensive.     When someone finds something that looks offensive then they do not have to take. There are people out there would would read something that is offensive to them so that they can lern from it. There is no reason why if you dont like the libary that you can not go to a differnt one. There is no reason for you to have to get so offensive of books because the authors is just trying to get their point accross and expressing their feeling on the subject.     The way that i look at it is that you have two oppions. The frist being deal with it and go to the libary and get books. The second is dont go to the library if your going to be able to find something offensive. But know if you pick the second one then you must realize were ever you go you are going to find some thing the will make you feel offensive so your might as well just get over it and say yea i will go because its all around me. yes i know what you must be thinking why if its not a big deal then why dont you just take them out. Well you want an answer and i will give you one. Those books mayne you don't want to read them. But what if someone eles does its not fair to get reed of something just because afew people find it offensive know is it?     There for i say that no we are not going to take books, music, movies, magazines and anything eles out of the libraries. You will just have to deal with what you dont want in here its not like were going to make you read something that you take offensive to. We will not going to get reed of the books, music, movies, magazines or anything else that we the library has. That is why everything that is in the library is staying in the library",3,4
3457,"In today's world being a child isn'@CAPS1 the easy thing, they have ideas and thoughts racing through our mind constantly, weather it is the stress of school or what there doing this @DATE1. But the last thought a child would have is if the literature their reading is offensive or not. I do not think that cencorship should be enforced more than it already is. Although that parents, and the government would disagree, cencorship is going to do nothing but make out future children more close minded and sheltered than they already are. Children shouldn'@CAPS1 lose their innocence so soon but they shouldn'@CAPS1 be so nieve about the world either. So I'm against censorship, because it's not going to accomplish anything but make children more sheltered.       Censorship is already posted on music and movies, and it's not doing anything children are still goint to listening to music that isn'@CAPS1 appropriate for their age, but they don'@CAPS1 know the meaning behind the lyrics. And cencoring movies and @CAPS1.V show aren'@CAPS1 going to help much either, because of the internet it has made it easier for teens and children to access thing more easily. So unless we censore the internet to certian. Which nobody wants that to happen then we have to let our children be more open to the public world, because they will find out about certian thing sooner or later.      Censorship is going to shape how our world operates eventually, but it doesnt have to. If parents just sat down with their children more and talked to them about certian then cersorship wouldn'@CAPS1 be needed",3,4
4020,"I can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the book shelf. I hope our children or any other children take this book off the shelf because it would be offensive or demeaning to the race of me or the children. This book would probably make the children asks question that we don't really want to talk about.           This book would probably be a book I wouldn't recommend for my children to read or even look at the pages or cover of the book. I mean if it wasn' t demeaning to anybody's race or skin color I would let my children read it, but if it had like profanity and racial slurs in it I would tell my kids that this book is off limits until you are older.          Certain magazines such as like swimsuit models and other inappropriate stuff my children shouldn't be aloud to look at. Music is like the magazines if it has like profanity and talks about drugs then I'm not going to let my kids listen to it. Movies are just like magazines and music, if it has inappropriate stuff in it then my kids don't need to watch or listen to it. My exception for a movie is if it is rated @CAPS1 or @CAPS2, then they are aloud to watch it but if it is rated @NUM1 or @CAPS3 then my kids can forget about watching it.      So in the end, yes I can think of a book, movie, or magazine that I don't want my children or any children to get their hands on cause you never know what that could lead to. And if your a strict parent like I plan on being don't let your kids watch, look at, or listen to inappropriate stuff because that is just putting bad stuff in their brain.      I have to admit I have watched, listened to, and looked at some bad stuff but I regret it all so very much so. There are so many inappropriate books, movies, magazines out there in today's libraries, it's bad because little kids can get a hold of this stuff and take it home without their parents noticing that they took this bad stuff home",3,3
3791,"I think that everyone has different views on different things so I dont think that they should be because if they would be that would be against the first amendment where it says everyone have the freedom of religion and speech.  If you disagree with the book or whatever it @MONTH1 be you can just ignore it and keep walking and never have to pay any attention to it.  People these days are taking things way to far with their opinions.     People need to mind their own business and stop thinking the world revolves around them.  There several billion people in the @LOCATION1 and every person looks at thing slightly different and this should be taken into consideration when the get mad just because there is a book or movie on the shelf of the library.  For example I like movies with comedy and sometimes a scary movie but girls @MONTH1 not like scary movies and @MONTH1 like movies with droma or somthing in that line.  Just because we like different things doesn't mean we should have to put just a so certain kind of books or movies on the shelf.       Yes, there are movies that I dont like because they stand for things that are against my religion but I dont stand around and say no one should watch these movies because just because I dont beleive in them doesn't mean I should judge other people for it.  I know some people feel that everyone one should look at things the same way as they do and everyone should should agree and get along but that is not how it is and no matter how much you want people to agree and get along it will never happen.  I think people need to mind their own business and let people read, listen to, and watch whatever they want to and it should not affend anyone.     I know people like to think that they know everything there is to know just because they have their own ways and thoughts.  People like this you can argue with and you will never win the arguement and you can never get them to understand how you look at it. They just think think my way is the right way and the only way.       This is the way I feel about people getting mad when there is a book or movie on the shelf that they dont not agree with.  I just think that evryone should try to undersatnd what you are saying and listen to you instead of ignoring you.  I feel this way but I am not a person that is tuck in their ways where you cant change their mind.",4,4
3861,"Why Should you be offended? The @CAPS1 is a place where you come and get what you like.The Libraries are organized for a reason,what I like is my prefence.You don't have to look at it if you don't want to. Everyone has there own taste.     Books, movies, music, and magazines are made for people to look at, read, watch. ect.. People have a prefence and they like to have it avaible when they want it. Libraries are great use for that. People go to get what they like to watch, read, and listen. And other people should not get offended by what other like.     Most Libraries are organized into sections for children, young adults, and adults. If there is material that you don't think is 'ok' for that sections then you can ask for it to be removed to another section. But don't think something is offensive and make it be removed because you don't like it. How is that fare to others who might like it.     If you are offended by a material that is in a section of the @CAPS1 that you think is not 'ok' then it ok for it to be moved to another section. You don't have to look at something if you don't like it. Someone else might like it. Libraries are made for all people, and everyone has there own taste. Don't be offended by what others like.",3,3
2989,"Personally I don't think libraries, movie stores, etc., should be selling any of the items just mentioned. If they are found offensive to the public. I think it offends lots of people. Citizens such as senior citizens and children shouldn't have to be exposed to inaproppriate material. I think in order to buy or rent certain books, music, movies, or magazines you should have to be at least eight-teen years of age. The economy is bad enough the way it is. There is a new generation of people who are being raised at the moment, and they should't have to look back at their childhood and have memories of seeing offensive movies, or reading offensive books and magazines.      I think music is what influences a person the most. If they are constantly listening to foul language and what not, that is going to just stay into a persons mind. I know this from experience. I also believe that movies influence a peron lot too. For example, a kid goes to see a movie that has a lot of violence in it. Well after he is done watching the movie he thinks to himself, 'well it must be okay to kill someone because i saw someone kill another person because they got away with it and never got into trouble.' That is just one example of how the humans mind can change.     In conclusion I do believe that humans have the right to read, watch, or listen to what they want. I just think that people should have to be a certain age for some of the things though. Also, I think that anything citizens find offending should be hidden in some sort of area in a store or library. So that  just people who want a certain item or whatever can get it with out other people having to see or listen to anything offending",3,4
3858,"The @CAPS1 Materials     Have you ever came acroos a book that you thought was really good, but knew it might show certain offense to someone you know. My censorship on materials that show offense in libraries is they should not be taking off the shelves. People should have ther own choice of books, and who has the right to tell someone what they should read. My opinion is that materials that @MONTH1 be offensive to certain individuals should not be taking off the shelf, but put in a certain section that says adult material such as books, music, movies,etc..     I myself have experienced not being able to get a certain movie because of my age. The book was called @CAPS2 @PERSON1, but it was just full of action/adventure.This was very unfair in my eyes, just because I was young I couldnt check out a certain movie. This was experience that I been through, which lead me to my opinion that materials that might show certain offenseto someone should not be removed.      Another reason that the materials should stay on the shelf is because many people like different things. No one is going to have the same interest all the time. So by takiny materials away is just helping one person, but hurting many by taking somethimg they @MONTH1 be interested in. I can understand that people have been through things, and might not be happy that offensive materials are around. Then again I think all materials are not the same they can get the materials they enjoy, and leave the other materials up to other people to choose from.     In conclusion I believe that the materials that show offense to certain people should stay. The reason being is because by the material that might show offense to an individual, might just be very interesting to another person. This a saying I heard before from the ebony magazine ,'another person junk @MONTH1 be someone else treasure' which I believe is a good saying for this topic",3,3
3796,"Libraries are a great resource for information all around the world.  They contain many different styles and genres of books.  Some might not be appropriate for young children to read.  There are people that debate whether or not some books are too offensive to be put up on library shelves.  I believe that no book should be denied of this right.  Most children that go to a library already know what kind of book they want and are with an adult at all times.     Most libraries have children sections.  Offensive books are most likely found in the teenager or adults sections, not the children section.  So, to my defense, there could really be no way that a child would seek out these 'offensive' books anyway.  Children today are exposed to more explicit topics, but I doubt they would want to read a book about them.     Next, if a child goes up to the check out desk the librarian should be able to tell their parent or guardian that certain book is not suitable for that age of child.  Going back to my point of children usually go to libraries with their guardians, they should be supervised at all times while in a library.  If an adult cares that much about what their child reads they can easily decide what is offensive or not.     Finally, authors should not be punished for writing something they believe in or like.  They worked hard on writing and publishing their novels, they should be able to show them off.  If librarians do take off books for being offensive to some adults, a lot of books will be gone from the shelves.  The quote used for this essay explains this thought more thoroughly.  People should be able to read whatever they want, offensive or not.  Children being able to do this? Depends on the parent.      There is no way a child could check out an offensive book, take it home, and read it without their guardian knowing.  Yes, all parents do not care about what their child reads, so this could happen.  Just because some adults complained about books being too offensive for their children doesn't mean a revolt has to happen.  Those parents should just step up and be more strict about what their child can and cannot read.  Some of the most 'offensive' books out there are the very best to read.",4,4
4175,"Libraries            @CAPS1 are many libraries throughout the @LOCATION1 that stock their shelves with materials such as books, magazines, music and movies. Libraries do have a purpose I must say, having a library gives out the information that you can't find elsewhere. Just think @CAPS1's a huge variety of everything you might need all in one place. Certain materials such as magazines and movies that are rated @CAPS2 for instance, should be placed elsewhere on the shelves immediately. If you'd like to rent them you @MONTH1 ask for assistance, and go from @CAPS1. Children of all ages step foot in your library and are bound to come across unneccessary information.  In my own perspective @CAPS1 should be an adult section, where only adults above a certain age should be aloud in or be able to check out. By keeping such materials shown or on display, @MONTH1 cause children to engage in dangerous or unsafe actions. As for music, it can go both ways. Music is more of a lifestyle, some people can't live without it. Adults in this day and age 'need music to survive' is what they commonly say. If your library decides to take these materials off the shelf, people @MONTH1 be turned away and your library @MONTH1 lose buisness.What is a library if you don't have music, books, magazines and movies? An empty room. Certain materials that are not appropriate for people of all ages should be placed high up, or in their own area where not everyone is aloud at. Taking away such materials @MONTH1 cause alot of grief. Just reorganize and make libraries enviornmentally safe so everyone is welcomed and @CAPS1 will be no complications",3,3
3811,"Nearly every person has seen, heard, wrote, or said something that offended someone. Most of the people that offened others do it on perpose in there music, books, or movies. While some other people accdeltly offened people by the way the worded somedthing. If someone finds something offensive, they should ask for it to be placed somewhere else so it is still avaible, ask for a vote to remove it from the shelves, or just keep it to themselves until they know their not to only one offeneded.     When someone gets offened by something they see and hear in a library, that person should ask for relocation for the offensive meteral they seen or heared. In this case, other people can still watch, hear, or read the book or magazine, movie, or music. Just because something is offensive to one person does not mean it is to someone else.     A book or magazine, song, or movie could be offensive to a lot of people, so it should be voted to be removed or stay in the labrary. This way the materal has a chance to be avaible in the future. Some music and movies could get removed then replaced with the censered version so it for the people that were not offened.     In some cases there is only one person that got offeneded by something that was in a library. In these cases the person could chose to wait to until someone else is offeneded by the materal to speek up about it's offensiveness.     If materal is offensive to someone they should get it relocated, voted on, or hold their peace. If relocated the materal is still avaible to other people. When voted one it could stay or be removed. Someone can speek up about the offensive materal after someone else find it offensive as well.",3,4
3901,"Human beings, like snowflakes, are very much alike in a unique way. Just as there are no two identical snowflakes, no two humans are exactly the same. As everyone has their differences, there are always those who have a greater sense of curiousity, and prefer to think outside the box. However, it is difficult for these curious people to extend their strive for knowledge, if they have restrictions as to what they can read or study. Therefore, if a person is mature enough, and desires to study or read upon a certain topic at a library, they should be allowed to extend their knowledge on any topic of their choosing, with permission of a gaurdian of course.     Unfortunately, it is often times a group of minorities that ruin something for the greater minority. Libraries often times take in account a child's age as a factor towards what a they can, and can not read, but age seems completely unfair to a child who is mature enough to read, and handle the more adult rated intell in a fashionable manner. If one is legally eligable, and they have permission from their gaurdian, then he or she should have no restrictions to the materials provided at any library what-so-ever. Who is one to say a ten-year-old is too young to learn about @PERSON1 and his horrible plans for the @CAPS1? A person is never too young, or too old to learn something new, if the curiousity and the proper level of maturity is present!     It is curiousity that has led mankind to discover something new each and every day. As well, it is curiousity that has brought mankind to the extraordinary level of technology, and inventions that it is at today. The youth of the present will one day be the engineers, doctors, scientists, and moving leaders of the future. If these young people are curious, and desire to achieve greater knowledge on a certain topic for positive reasons, then let them be!",3,3
4693,"I somewhat agree with taking out books,music,movie,magazines, or any other material that could be offensive to someone, because it could be racial or it could be about something that isn't appropriote for children to read. I think it just depends on the topic, maybe one thing could be offensive to one person and not the other, so people should choose wisely what they read.      It wouldn't be fair to take certain books from the shelves of libaries because people take different interset in different topics, so say one book has something in it that someone doesn't think is appropriote but another person think that book is fine, it wouldn't be fair to the other person to take that book from the shelves.  But something that I do disagree with in books or magizines that is inappropriote is pictures and comics, because children shouldn't be allowed to have access to a book,movie, or a magazine that has that type of content in it. But also I think that parents or an adult should look at the criteria first before they allow a child to read or see it.     So it depends on what type of things are in the book,movie, or magazine. Basically it's up to the person, if they don't like the criteria in any of those things then they shouldnt look into it",3,3
3009,"Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be removed from certain library shelves because people have enough sense on what they are interested in and what they are not interested in.  There will always be people that find specific thoughts or ideas offensive no matter what the subject is, so censorship does not really make a difference to the individual.  Censorship is not necessary because people know what they are interested in without anyone helping them find what they are looking for.       Censorship is not entirely necessary because people will always find something that they are not exactly looking for or interested in.  People's interests are their own business without the censorship of others in the surrounding community.  I've read a couple books that have cussing in them, but the book is still as good as it would be without the cussing in it.  People like things no matter what, because there will always be flaws with some objects such as books, music, and movies.  Books, music, and movies all have much interest from the common person, and each individual is capable of making their own decisions based on what they are interested in.  The individual does not need edited objects, or music to listen to the music or other objects without being offended.  There is something offensive to people in every work that has been published, and the buyer is fully aware of that fact before they go and buy something.     Censorship is not necessary because individuals are aware of what they are interested without anything telling them what to look for.  People will almost always get offended about what they are watching or listening to no matter what it is, so why is censorship such a big deal?  Censorship is not needed in today's society because each specific individual is capable of making their own decision in what's best for themselves.  Books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should not be taken away from the library shelves because there will always be some offensive objects that some individuals will find offensive no matter what the object is.",3,4
4116,"What should and should'nt be censored in a library really is just a matter of opinion from the people using the library. If everyone were to removed what they didnt like from the shelves of a library then much information would be less acceceble to the general public. Although some people @MONTH1 be offended by some forms of literature, this doesnt mean that the literature should be removed from everyone. I beleive a solution must be made to satisfy everyone.     Currently, some people arent happy with some of the books, music, movies, and magazines that are available at many libraries. They believe that the information @MONTH1 be unsuitable for some veiwers. Some people just do not want certain information getting in the minds of children.     While that is a very solid reason to censor what goes into our libraries; there are others who dissagree with the thought of censoring our libraries. By allowing the censoring of libraries it would decrease the amount of information available to the public. If parents allow their children to take out certain materials without first checking whats behind the cover, then the parents have noone to blame but themselves.     I believe that this could all be resovled by simply having parents fill out a form before allowing their children to get a library card. This form would include a list of things that they would want to prevent their kids from checking out such as: swearing in books and music, nudity in movies and magazines. This information would be put with the cerial number of the library card. If their child were to checkout something that is restricted on the list, the librarian would tell them to put the book back and pick another book.     I can see how censorship is very useful and important. Although sometimes it can be takin a bit to the extreme. There is a solution out there, but we just need to find it.",4,4
4122,"Should certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., be removed from shelves if they are found offensive?     I do not think that certain materials should be removed for many reasons. Many different people have many different thoughts on whats offensive and what isn't like some people will find something funny that some people @MONTH1 think is nasty or inapropiate. If you was to take things off the shelves that someone found offensive there probably wouldn't be much left on the shelves because everybody has they're own oppenion. I agree that certain things shouldn't be seen by young eyes but thats the parents decision, not everyone has the same view on the material.     Certian materials should not be removed from shelves because of one persons oppenion on it. Everyone has they're own oppenion, some people like what other people don't everyone is different in they're own way",3,3
3180,"Sexual conduct, language, and criminal behavior are three big things in my school, and community. Certain books, movies, music, and magazines are all about those three things. If they are in our libraries, how can teachers and administration keep us from it during school? I think the censorship of some movies, magazines, and especially music should be highly discussed, and more strict.     We do not really have a lot of movies in our school library, but I do know that there are some in the town library. Parents and adults do not want us growing up so fast, and yet they allow sexual, crude language movies to be on the shelves of libraries. If it is such a big deal, I think they need to be removed. I'm a big believer on the fact that if it happens, it is going to happen no matter @CAPS1 precautions are taken. But with that said, we can still take the needed precautions to keep it from kids that are too yound to see them, like under the age of @NUM1. It is not just movies that we have to worry about though.     @ORGANIZATION1 is a magazine that is devoted to giving their readers tips on sex, problems with their sex lives, and the occassional '@CAPS1 to wear this @DATE1!' articles. I will say that I have read this magazine, but it doesn't appeal to my interests. Some kids today though, are very attentive to those subjects. Again, that goes back to the problem of kids growing up too fast. I have noticed in my school alone, that it is a rapidly growing problem. If magazines like this weren't on the shelves for us to see whenever we enter a library, maybe we would not be as keen to the idea. If we were not introduced to it so early, we would not be going behind our parents' backs trying to do it. @ORGANIZATION1, and other magazines like it, needs to be taken off the shelves as soon as possible. Music is a world-wide phenomenon.     Say a child around the age of @NUM2 is listening to the new @CAPS2' @PERSON1 song. He is being introduces to crude language, sexual behavior, and criminal acts in the @NUM3 minute time period it takes to listen to the full song. Seriously, it only takes that long for a child to be introduced, and it is only one song out of the thousands that are out there. This music is able to be accessed on many computers, especially in public, town libraries. We are not allowed to act like that in school, and if we are going to be spending @NUM4 of our childhood/teenage years here, why let us listen to it? If you walk into a library, all you have to do is sign your name, the date, and the time you got there to access a computer. After that, they can not tell you to get off of it, unless you are violating the law or looking up something not age appropriate. Music does not fall into that category. It, too needs to be taken away if the language, sexual conduct, and criminal behavior messages are adult rated.     I, personally, love magazines, movies, and music. They are my three m's and I live by them. But not the ones that are going to get me in trouble, put wrong messages in my head, or cause me (subconciously) do participate in a criminal act. I always allow my mother or father to read books, listen to music, and watch movies with me. If they are not pleased with @CAPS1 it is, I will not do it behind their back. The censorship in libraries needs to be more strict. If it were more strict, it would keep our younger children from growing up to fast and keep teens from participating in criminal acts. The censorship in libraries is an ongoing problem and it needs to be fixed.",3,4
3610,"Offensive books do belong in the library, just in a completely different area, away from the children. If we all chose a book that we didn't want in the library, there would be none left. So, since everyone has a different opinion about what is offensvie and what isn't, who's to say what can and can't be in the library?     When I was little, my grandma would take me to the library almost every @DATE1. I noticed that she tried to keep me from getting certain books and was fine with others. My @CAPS1 did the same thing, but they had different opinions on what was okay for me to read and what wasn't. Grandma wanted me to get religious books and @CAPS1 was okay with that and things like '@CAPS2 the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5', and '@PERSON1'.      Even at home, everyone's opinion is very different. For instance, when it comes to music at my house; @CAPS1 likes country, @CAPS7 likes metal, my brother likes alternative, my unlcle likes rock, and I like a combonation of all of it.      That just does to show how different people have different opinions; some more strict than others. If we relied on peoples' opinions to keep our librarys free of offense, there would be nothing in it",3,3
3902,"In most libraries in the @LOCATION1, there are certain books, movies, music, etc., that could be inappropriate to younger children.  These books and movies can contain graphic content or offensive language that any young child should not be hearing or seeing.  However, this does not mean that the libraries of @LOCATION2 should get rid of these books, videos, etc.  The libraries should keep these books and videos because the adults of @LOCATION2 like to use them, the kids probably already know about the language and graphic content, and some of the books and movies that are offensive are very educational.     When you think about your childhood, there would always be things you couldn't watch or listen to because you were to young.  Your @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 would watch movies that you couldn't watch because they would say you aren't old enough.  They enjoy watching more mature movies because it is more interesting to them than cartoon shows or movies.  The mature content in movies, books, and more should be kept in libraries because mature audiences enjoy watching and listening to them.  If they are taken out of libraries, this mature audience has nothing to watch or read in the library.  They do not want to be reading children's books all the time.     Also, most children have already observed or heard this offensive content in these books and movies.  Most of the parents in the @LOCATION1 have used offensive language infront of their child without even realizing it.  The kid then starts using these words because they think they are cool if @CAPS1 and @CAPS2 use them.  Another thing is that most kids have seen a movie with graphic content in it, or they have played a video game with it in the game.  They have seen blood, gore, and other things in these games and movies.  It's already too late to try and hide your child from seeing or hearing these 'bad words' or 'graphic content'.     Many movies and books that contain offensive language and graphic content are very good and educational videos.  For example, '@CAPS3 @CAPS4 @CAPS5' was a great movie describing the search for one man in the middle of @CAPS6 @CAPS7 @NUM1.  These wars actually occured and movies like this give a great amount of detail on what actually went on during these wars.  If you want kids to know about the history of our country, they need to know what actually happened.  There is no point in trying to hide the truth.     Overall, most kids in the @LOCATION1 have heard offensive language or graphic content.  Whether it was from a parent or even their best friend, they have heard it.  So why woyld we try to hide this from them? Keep these books, movies, music, and more in the libraries for the benefits of the adults, the kids, and for the history of the country.",4,4
4558,"Yes, I believe that certian materials should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. Some people do not want to read about those things that they have less intrest in. Materials like that can offend many people, so they should be removed from public shelves.      For example, someone, by accident, @MONTH1 stumble upon a book containing inappropriate materials. They could take it home and begin reading it, and realize that the material that they are reading contains information that offends them. That really concerns some people and can hurt the library that held the book, and they could begin losing customers.      Another reason why inappropriate materials should not be publicly displayed is, children. What if a young child was wondering around a store or a library, and randomly picked up a book or magazine with offensive pictures in it? That young child would see things that were not meant for that child to see. But, it does happen. Imagine how angry the parents of the child would be. They would most likely do everthing they could to get those materials removed from being displayed in public and from being within a child's reach. Children deffinately do not need to be seeing those things and also, even some adults do not even prefer it.      Religion is also an example of why places should watch what they put on their shelves. It @MONTH1 be against some religions to read inappropriate materials. And with out them knowing their book contained it and they read it, they would be greatly offended and very upset. That could turn many people away from reading certain books, or even going to the store where they even purchased those materials.      In conclusion, all of these are perfect examples of why inappropriate materials should be removed to prevent people from being offended. This is why materials such as books, magazines, etc. should be removed from public shelves, because they can offend many people",4,3
2990,"A library is a place you can go to read, write, and relax.  Nowadays, many people take for granted the knowledge that can be obtained there.  Even more of the knowledge to be learned is being stripped away and cut down by censorship.  Censorship can eliminate many varieties of reading materials that people can learn from and enjoy.       First of all, removing classics from the shelves of libraries because they @MONTH1 offend certain people is completely unwarranted.  If they offend you then do not read them.  It is as simple as that.  Many books offend people because they are not in agreement with their morals or beliefs.  A great example of this is the @PERSON2 series.  @PERSON2 @PERSON2 is a bestselling series with over a million copies that have been sold worldwide; however, it does not corrolate with many people's beliefs.  Therefore those people boycott the series.     I remember several years ago I attended a @PERSON2 @PERSON2 and the @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 party at the local library to celebrate the next book in the series being released.  While I was at the library there was a gigantic storm brewing.  Now most people would think that it was only a storm, but the people in town who did not like the @PERSON2 books blamed it on the party.  They said that we were worshipping the devil and @CAPS4 brought the storm to tell us that what we were doing was wrong.  I know many people do not like the @PERSON2 series because there is witchcraft and wizardry in it, but that does not mean that they should blame natural occurences on a book!       Even great novels like the @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 should not be banned because of their content.  For a while, @CAPS5 in the @CAPS6 was reading material for school, but then the 'morality police' banned it because it was about a crazy person.  Books should not be required to meet everyone's personal standards.     Consequently, what Katherine Paterson states is true.  If we ban books because we do not agree with them or find them suitable, eventually there will not be any left to check out at the library.  Although there could be a way to compromise.  If the books with questionable content had a sticker on them telling the reader that, then it could benefit both sides.       In conclusion, eliminating books is not a good idea because of how beneficial they are to us all, especially children.  When I was young I would always want to be read to and when I continued to age I would always read.  While I was in middle school every day I would have a book with me to read.  Books allow the reader to travel to far off places or see what it would be like to walk in someone else's shoes.  Books are a gateway to another world.  Why take that magic away from children",5,4
4102,"I believe that the children of today should be able to read, and learn the same things that our parents have learned in the past. Learning things through the same teachings, books, movies... etc.      Learning things this way would be better then taking out cussing, swaring and certain detailed writing, because if you took all that away its like lieing about history, and what really happend.     Should the children of today be deprived of the truth? Would you want your children going to school everyday and learning things from a text book that were twisted around just so that it was apropriate and non offencive? Think about it... Were you deprived of learning history when you were in school? I didn't think so, so why start now?     Say your child is going to be reading '@ORGANIZATION1' in @CAPS1 class today. Would you want to ruin a classic book by taking the '@CAPS2' word and the word 'slave' out of the book? Depriving them of how there use to be slave owners, slaves, and racial comments? Depriving them of actual history? Would you also deprive them from learning about wars, revolutions, and mass killings just to make learning apropriate?     No. I wouldn't. I would want my children learning anything and everything about world history. I do not think that there should be censorship in libraries",4,4
4542,"Many different people have views on what they want their children to be exposed to, whether it be in books, movies, music, or any other type of media. So should libraries be more strict and remove certain items that might come across as offensive or vulgar to parents or even students? I believe that it completely depends on how a library advertises or who they allow to check out what.     I know that a certain case, specific to me, is that my mother did not like me reading a specific series becasue she thought that it was not an appropriate reading material for me. Because of that, that does not mean she marched down to the library and demand that they get rid of all the books written by that author. She respected the fact that others enjoyed reading the books and just asked me to steer clear of them and to find something more appropriate for me to read.     In many libraries, I know that they have certain areas for specific age groups of people like children, teenagers, and adults. Within those specific designated areas, they have kind of 'sub-area' where they seperate educational from entertainment and so on. Let's say one parent gets offended by a specific section, such as a sex education section, should they ask the library to remove it completely? I do not think that will help anything because there are students who use that topic for areas they are studying and parents who use it as educational tools with their own children.     I do believe that libraries should put stamps or notices on their different types of media saying that only a certain age group is aloud to look at them and be able to check them out. An eight year old should not be able to go in and get a @NUM1 movie whenever they want to. There should be restrictions on areas like that, but for someone to come in and say to take out all the @NUM1 movies is a ridiculous thing to do because there are others who enjoy that type of entertainment.    Libraries to respect the fact that there are different types of people with different interests and they try to make their environment as comfortable for everyone as possible. They will have children's videos seperate from the adult videos and they even have a whole seperate section of books for them to discover and journey into. The only thing that I believe should not be in libraries is vulgar magazines or videos. A library is still a public, family area, after all, and no child should accidentily stumble upon any raunchy article.     So, should libraries completely remove areas of media? I do not think so. I think that they should distinguish from adult's and children's materials. Katherine Paterson says, 'But if I have the right to remove books from the shelf . . . then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If we continue to take books off of the shelves then eventually there will be nothing to read.",4,4
3024,"Libraries are our way of knowing what has happened in the past whether it is all fact or maybe fiction.  No matter what type of book it is, it still tells us a story of another place and another time. Libraries should not be censored.     Taking away one book because of one sentence that seems vulgar and inapropriate for young readers is wrong.  I understand that reading books with adult material such as drug abuse and sexuality can lead to experimentation but is that not life?  At least once in our exsistance on earth we find ourselves curious about something at we try it, just to see what it is like.  It is all a learning experience.      History would most likely be the touchiest subject in our libraries mainly because we are asshamed of what we acted like thirty plus years ago, discrimination in @LOCATION1, the @CAPS1, and now the wars in the middle east.  Some countries do not even teach their own history to students in school because they are embarrassed of what happened or afraid that it might happen again if the students know @CAPS6, why and what happened.  Reading and knowing about what our ancestors did will help us lead a better future not distroy it.      Today's media has overflowed with adult material not suitable for kids under @NUM1.  If anything we need to start censoring what we broadcast on television and also what we post on the @CAPS4 and leave our libraries alone. Most of the books that are in our libraries has been there for like forty years so it is completely pointless to remove it when it has already educated young minds for over forty years.      I truthfully do not know why you would want to remove books or censor them with a sharpie marker.  All that is doing is giving readers less material to read.  In @LOCATION2, elementary educators are not required to teach their students @CAPS6 to spell, at all. I walked into a third grade classroom and watched a girl spell @CAPS2 '@CAPS3' thinking that was the correct why to spell @CAPS2.  The @ORGANIZATION1's excuse for not having teachers teach @CAPS6 to spell is that they should learn that from reading books everyday.  Well guess what @LOCATION2, with the @CAPS4, gaming systems and iPods, little kids are not taking to reading like they did ten years ago and we are going to have a lot of future adults not know @CAPS6 to read and this is what it is going to be like.      '@CAPS5 @CAPS6 do you spell encyclopedia?'     '@CAPS6 should i know, I wasn't taught @CAPS6 to spell in @LOCATION2.'     You see what I mean, so if you are going to take away the ability to spell you better not take away our books becuase they are the only things teaching our @ORGANIZATION1's future on @CAPS6 to spell simple words.        Today we have the @CAPS4, gaming systems, iPods and @CAPS8 to intertain us on a daily basis.  No one is taking to reading as a way to relieve boredom, they are just sitting on the couch watching television.  And now if you reduce reading material for teens and young readers you are not incouraging us to read.  You are taking away all of the interesting parts of a book.  To be truthfull I will read and reread a book many times over if it is a good story with some extra sizzle.  I do not enjoy books that do not have drugs, alcohol, family stress, war stories or even some sexuality mainly because books without that are boring.  When i read books like that they make me feel better about my life and @CAPS6 I interact with others.  I have learned @CAPS6 to deal with all of those things from books.  Most of my knowledge comes from those types of books and I would hate for my children to not be able to read the same materials as I did at their age and learn from those books",4,4

3040,"Should censorship be used on library books? Obviously if you are talking to an adult then yes, more than likely they don't want their pupils to be learning inappropriate words, but if you ask any student the same question you will probably get mixed answers.

To me personally I don't think it's that big of a deal to have a few inappropriate words in a book, but they shouldn't be allowed on shelfs in a middle school's library or lower. High school and up I think that its okay to have on the shelves in magazines, books, music and movies.     When I was a child my mother always said don't cuss, but growing up in an enviornment where the overwhelming majority of people you talk to cuss, then after awhile it comes out like normal words. So why not have it in the books, and movies? It's not like we don't know what the words mean. If they hurt your feelings then you know not to read, listen or watch it again. I'm not saying cuss words are good and that it's ok for them to be in every sentence you say, but hearing or reading a few won't kill you.     In some cases, cuss words are good for a story. Sometimes your reading a book and someone gets in an argument, you don't even realize it till the argument is over, but with sometimes when there is a cuss word, you stop and say,' @CAPS1 something is going on here, and I want to know what it is.' @CAPS2 catches your attention and keeps you hooked on whatever it is until you find out what happened.     Consequently; movies, books, music, and magazines with foul language does have an affect on our youth.  A lot of children are cussing at an early age, but thats just how people communicate, show emotions, and get someones attention. Censorship can take away a lot from a book, overall making it less interesting, so again I believe censorship should not be a deciding factor in choosing a book, movie, music or magazine. Choose it because it looks interesting and its something you might enjoy",3,3
3413,"I don't think nothing should be taking off the shelves at the libraries, if it's educational to your child in a certain way it should stay. Children can learn alot from the books at the libraries. If you need help or answers about certain things you can always find what you are looking for in a library, they have all the answers. You can not get everything off the internet some stuff you have to look up by opening a book. As I was growing up, I was able to get what I needed done for my school at the library.     It's so many things at the libraries that's educational, you just have to know what you are looking for. For some of these adults, if you was having a hard time looking for what you needed at the library, do not mean the same for your child. Sometimes your children has a better time understanding then you did at their age. Parents please don't take away the good things out the libraries that could really help your child at times. If it was not helpful, they would have never put it in the library from the start.     There are things that you would be better off finding in a book, because not everthing is on the enternet. So many sciencest found their information in a book, because its easier. You learn so many good things from a libraries. The books and things in a library help you with so much research. Taking materials out of a library I would have to disagree.",3,3
4424,I think they should be taken off the shelves if they are to vaulger to young children. like if it has to deal with sex or violence they should be taken off shelves. they should only be aloud to put @NUM1 stuff on the shelves. i think that they shouldnt even makes books or magazines like that unless they can keep them hid from people under the age of @NUM2. but people are gonna do what they want to do. thats all i have to say. have a nice day.,2,2
3532,"This essay is to describe my opinion on if certain materials that can be offensive, should be removed from shelves in libraries. I think that overall, anything taken as offensive to anybody should be taken out of libraries.     I think that if they are very offensive, then they should be taken out; but if they are just mildly offensive, then i think they should stay. Because the library welcomes people of all ages, materials that can be taken offensive for children are most of the time not taken as offensive to adults. But since children go in there and can have access to anything in there, they can end up finding something that can be offensive.     If a child finds something that their parents can be taken as offensive, then the library could possibly get sued and that would not be good. So if they just take any books, music, magazines, or movies that are not suitable for people of all ages, they can cut the risk of being sued.     Libraries are meant to provide information anyways. They have no need for things that are offensive, because rarely something that is offensive, provides information. Libraries should just contain what they were made for: encyclopedias, dictionaries, books, and other books that can provide useful information to people.     In conclusion I would say that materials that can be offensive to anyone of any age, should be taken out of libraries. Libraries are meant to provide information to people so I think thats all that they should have",3,3
3961,"Browsing for a book at your local library that you've read, wanting to reread @CAPS1 to enjoy the sounds of its words again? You look shelf after shelf, not locating @CAPS1 anywhere. You searched everywhere, by everything that the book would possibly be listed under. You've browsed paper backs, hard backs; eventually letting your frustration take over.Giving up on locating the novel, you walk over to the librarian and ask about @CAPS1. She replies with, 'I'm sorry, we had to remove that particular novel due to a person finding @CAPS1 offensive to them.' You're infuriated, you decide to write a article to your local newspaper about the outrage of the books, movies, music, etc. that has been taken out of your local library.     Personally, I don't think that the media taken away from the library should be considered offensive. How can you consider what is offensive and what is not? A book could be offensive to one person, but not another. Different people have different opinions, and @CAPS1's not reasonable to remove a book or other type of media from a library because @CAPS1 contains 'offensive material.' @CAPS1's ridiculous; @CAPS1 infuriates me that someone would do that. If you think @CAPS1 could get into the hands of a child, or someone that @CAPS1 would effect, do not rent the item. That's why at most libraries, there are seperate areas for adults and children so that children don't obtain these items.     How can you determine if something is offensive? I personally don't find a lot of things offensive, but just because something is offensive to me, doesn't mean I will request to have @CAPS1 banned so that other people can't enjoy @CAPS1. If you find something offensive, just leave @CAPS1 alone. Don't bother, annoy, or hassle someone else that had nothing to do with its creation with @CAPS1. @CAPS1's not only disrepectful to the individual you file a complaint to, but the artist who created @CAPS1. You do have the right to voice your opinion, but sometimes, @CAPS1 doesn't have to voiced.     We live in such a closed-minded world. We have people who don't even think @CAPS1's approprite to show one's arm. I can see why some people take offense to these things, but honestly, @CAPS1's mediocre to report something just becuase you do not agree with @CAPS1. We have a vast knowledge of what's right or wrong, what is or is not appropriate for an audience to hear. If @CAPS1 weren't appropriate, you honestly think @CAPS1 would have been published? Sure there are things in book, music, etc. that are inappropriate, but to be so closed-minded to have something banned for use of foul language, minor sexual content, or violence is unlogical. You can find worse, hear worse, just by walking down the street just about anywhere.     To answer the question bluntly, no, I do not think that media should be banned just because @CAPS1 is offensive. We as @CAPS2 have the right to speak our voice, from two different perspectives. You can argue if something is mediocre, is offensive; I will argue back, just because I have the right to voice my opinion as you do. These reasons that enjoyable media are banned, such as language and violence, add emphasis, meaning, emotion, and make the reader dig for so much more in a book, song, etc. These are how the authors see their work, they want to show the people what they see, even if @CAPS1 does offend someone else.",4,4
4590,"I say tht they shouldn't take off books that are found affensive and im going to say why I think that.I think that they shouldn't take off those books because thats the way it was written, and if the person that finds that book offensive then just don't read it.Another reason they shouldn't take it off its because a author wrote it but im sure that he didn't think that a person was goin to find it offensive.My third reason they shouldn't take it off the shelf its because the book might be really good and interesting, except for tht one person that thinks its offensive.I just told y'all why I think they shouldn't take the book off the shelf just because one person says so.",2,3
4505,"Hey my name is @PERSON1 and I have some things to talk about that people need to hear. I think that libraries are a good thing for people of all ages but, there are some books in the library that are not made for children to read or evan see. They should at least put them in a seprate part of the library.     I had an experince like this once. I was about to leave to go to the library when my little brother asked if he could come with me. I didnt want to take him but I couldnt say no to him. He got his shoes on and he ran to the door, he was so excited. We pulled up to the library and he took off running to the doors. I chased after him, when I caught him I told him that he couldnt run away from me like that. We went inside, it was a giant library. He went to find a book to look at and I went to find a good book to read. I found one that looked very interesting I got it and started to read it. Then @CAPS1 ran to me and said I should go take a look at the book he was looking at, so I went with him to go see the book. He handed it to me and I just lost it, the book was not a children book at all. I was one of the worst book that I have ever seen, we left the library and never came back.      I think that books that are bad for children should be in there own section in the library. This section should be for grown ups only and that no children are aloud in there. This is what I think sould be done to all libraries",3,3
4203,"Have you ever felt that books are offensive? Maybe, but @CAPS2 all depends on who you are and @CAPS1 angers you. Somepeople think that books, music, movies, and etc. can be offensive in some way. I know they can, but @CAPS2 can only effect an amount of people if they together understand the problem. I think there are several ways why and why not to take books out of our libraries.     From @CAPS1 I hear, people do go angry over things but the question is '@CAPS1 gets them so angry?' @CAPS2 is different for somepeople than others. For example, a @ORGANIZATION1 fan reads a book about them and the author makes fun of them or teases them. That is a way to make someone offended and angry at a book. others can get mad at a movie because @CAPS2 discriminates races of other kinds. Like how in the @NUM1's, some movies characterized @CAPS3 @CAPS4 as stubborn, ignorant, human beings. In my view, actually being @CAPS3 @CAPS6 myself, sort of aggrivates me too, but none the less, shouldnt argue because of one major amendment, freedom of speech.     @CAPS2 depends on how @CAPS2 angers them also, like how back in world war @NUM2, the @CAPS7 people were characterized as short, fat people with big noses taking all the money away from the @CAPS8. That can be offensive, and is used usually to talk people over to their side. I think that if something offends you lightly, most of the time you shouldnt worry about @CAPS2, but if you get offended very heavily and none of the stuff they say about that topic is true, maybe you should get someone else to read @CAPS2 with the same dislikes and likes as you. That could help determine if @CAPS2 is truly offrnsive to people in general, not just you.      Then after that the main question we would ask would be '@CAPS1 should we do next?' If I were someone and the book I'm reading offends me massively, I would contact the library @CAPS2 came from and ask them to read @CAPS2, and if they think @CAPS2 is offensive, then they would more than likely take @CAPS2 off the shelfs. Now just because of someone that likes a sports team reads a book about them and the book talks trash about the team, dont tell the library, thats just a waste of time. Just simply pick up another book and read @CAPS2. I can understand how people will get mad over racism and disrimination, but not over a sports team.     So I hope that people can someday understand the limit to were something can actually be offending. Or maybe its just in our common nature for us to be offended when something we like gets made fun of. That is why I think that books should only be taken off shelfs for only very good reasons, not silly one",4,4
4767,"This is going to be an essay about if people finding somthing offensive in a library or in music that it should be censored. It is also about if you think it should be taken off the shelves because some people find it offinsive.     The way I look or my own oppinion is that they should censore most things from libraries and music,but not get rid of it because one person finds it offensive. If you think about it thoses uncensered material like books that some people fnd offinsive might be a fit book for someone else to what they can relate to as they were growing up.     On the other hand they should be more carful about it so when younger kids listen to the radio or are reading a book they dont get the wrong ideas. We should censor things but only with an extent and not go over board with it. In the long run it might help with a more clean and safe population because were are censoring things to wear people dont hear bad and only hear the good in life. You never know you could make a big differance by doing that.      The reason i wouldnt go out and censor everthing is because you cant stop everone from doing it. You can always give it a try but thats one of the main reasons why i wouldnt try and get rid of it cause a sertan person might find it offensive. I ncan understand if you took it off there self that someone found offinse but only move it to wear no one will find it offensive.     Im not saying its wrong to do that but i think it could and probably would make alot of people angry. But hey what can i say what has the government done that we dont like or cant do anything about it. And thats all i have to say about that.",3,3
3253,"If something offensive is found at the library, should it be taken off of the shelves? Some people might look at this question and instantly say yes. Others might not think anything of the item and move along. I disagree with those who believe the item should be remove. Instead, I believe the item should not be removed and stay on the shelves.      As a child, I have always gone to the child's section of the library to find a book. I steared clear of the 'grown-up' area. So if my mother found an offensive item on the shelves she would make sure I didn't see it. I believe if the parent watches what their child sees then they wouldn't worry about them seeing something offensive.      However, let's say that an adult sees this item and feels it should be removed. She/he has the right to remove that item but what if, to someone else, that item was exactly what they were looking for? The world we live in has many offensive things in it that we see everyday, such as newspapers, @CAPS1 programs, billboards, etc., and if someone were to come along and take it all away, we would have nothing left but that one persons interests.      This is why we have a little bit of everything in our libraries. If there is an offensive book or a bad @CAPS2 and someone doesn't like it and feels the need to remove it, that is @CAPS3 but then they aren't thinking of what other people might like. I have always heard the saying, 'If everybody liked the same thing, it would be a boring world.' I find this to be completely true.      If everybody liked the same thing, then let anybody that enters the library remove an offensive item. However, if this happens, authors won't want to keep writing books and singers won't want their @CAPS4 there if they find out someone keeps removing their work. On the same note, people won't want to go to the library if they know they won't find what they want because someone took it down.      I disagree with the ones who feel the item should be removed because to someone that book might be perfect. I believe that the book or magazine or @CAPS2 should stay on the shelf for someone who has the intent to read it. If a person walks by and feels the book is offensive, they need realize that to someone else it might not be and walk away. I am sure people would find my choice of books offensive or bad and would like to remove them from shelves. However, I would stop going to the library if that happened. This is why I feel books should stay where there are",4,4
3218,"I believe that certain books, music, movies, magazines, etc. shouldn't be removed from the shelves. I say this because, what @MONTH1 be offensive to one person @MONTH1 not come close to being offensive to another. There are many different types of books, movies and even some music that have some history to it, it @MONTH1 be offensive, but to some certain race or culture it's history.          What @MONTH1 be historical or even informational to one person it will be offensive to the other and vice versa. If everybody had a chance to go into the biggest library made and take something that @MONTH1 be offensive to them down I think that the library would have little to no books in it. Katherine said, 'And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' meaning if parents or teenagers took 'offensive' material off the shelf that there will be nothing else left.          A lot of things are offensive because of religion beliefs, but not everybody has the same religion or even a religion at all. Just like religion shouldn't be taught in public schools, censoring shouldn't be allowed in public libraries. If censoring did happen in public libraries, I'm sure there will be protests and possibly riots over this censoring.            People said that @PERSON2 was a bad man, well if we take books and movies off the shelves showing what he did, I believe history will be more likely to repeat itself. A lot of things have been bad in history that we read about today, like gangs, if we don't read about the wrong they do or see the movies to show how it would be like if you were a gang member would there be an increase in gang activity and members? this is why I believc we shouldn't take books, magazines, movies, etc. off of the shelves",3,3
3885,"If I was givin the chance to choose if people should take books off of shelves or not that offend people at local libraries, I would think neither taking the books off the shelf, nor leaving them on @CAPS1 are quite correct. I would defiently reccomend a voting to take place, in order to figure out what to do with the books. I would say a vote would be reasonable because many people have many different beliefs, in which some could be offended. So I would take at least ten different people with different religions,backgrounds, and so forth, and I would have them all vote on which they thought they should do with the offensive books.      People believe differently, so it would be hard to please them all. That's why a vote with different types of people would be effective for almost anyone. Just like my mom said, 'you will never make everyone happy.'  @CAPS1 are so many things out in the society today that can offend people, and what might majorly offend one, might have no effect on the other. This is the main reason voting is rough, because @CAPS1's a wide variety of people on earth today. You would have to probably also look at how many times the book has been checked out before, because @CAPS1 is a possibility that no one in the voting group has the same opinion as those who have checked it out before.      Although if the book is voted to stay in the library, I believe the book should be labeled in the correct area. Due to the fact that the book could be offending to some people, should be labeled incase someone who doesn't know, like a child, comes upon that book.      Voting is used in our society today and has been very effective for many years now. Voting doesn't only have to be used during an election, but also can be used for this reason as well. Voting is always important and people should notice that. I believe that voting could be the answer to many problems in  the world today",3,3
4648,"Some people believe that certain materials, such as books, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive. However, I do not believe they should be removed. People are mature enough to be able to handle offensive material. Most people check out books or movies that they have heard about, so for the most part they know what they are reading @MONTH1 be offensive. Instead of removing the ofensive material, there should just be a warning to let readers know that what they are checking out is considered offensive.           These days, people are mature enough to read offensive material. We see many types of offensive material every day. Examples of this inlcude when we watch the news, we @MONTH1 see numerous offensive pictures or videos. There are also many news stories that many people consider offensive. When a person checks out an offensive book, they are doing so because they want to. Libraries should not revoke a reader's right to read what he/she wants.           Before a person checks out a book or movie, they should look into it to make sure they are okay with what they are getting. This can prevent many problems. For example, say a young reader sees a book that they think looks interesting. If they don't read into it a little bit and just take it home, they @MONTH1 later find that it contains offensive material. However, if they read a little bit about it before they check it out, they will find out it contains offensive material, and can then make the decision on whether or not they still want to read it.           There are many ways libraries can prevent children or other people not mature enough to view the offensive material from seeing it. They can put a warning label on the book or movie to inform people that that particular item is considered offensive. Libraries could even put an age limit on checking out offensive material. Either of these ideas could be an efffective way to ensure that only mature people are checking out anything that is considered to be ofensive.     Libraries should not have to remove books, music, movies, magazines, etc. that contain offensive material from the shelves. If a person wants to check out a book that is offensive, they should be allowed to check it out and read it. Also, people should be intelligent enough to look into whatever item they are checking out before hand so they can be aware of the offensive material. However, to make things even easier, libraries could just put a warning label on offensive material to prevent some people from reading it.",4,4
3709,"When you go to a library you think its going to be a place that is a good influence. Your not thinking when you send your kids their that there's going to be bad things. Most people go the the library to study or use the computers... But what about the other people?     I went to the library and saw racest books most adults would find that offensive especially if its an afracan american. The thing is that people would also go there and check the books out to sutdy about the old times it's not there to offend people. Some books are very infromational and people need to study and learn about the past so that it doesnt happen again.     Another peroblem most people have is with the adult books parents defantly dont want their children looking or checking thoughs books out. But when noone stops them from checking the books out there really is not anything you can do about it. I believe that libraries should have an age limit for checking out certen books.     The last thing is the music it has bad language in it and kid can just check them out with out even trying hard. Most parants the to sheild their kids so they will be good and not use dirty language but when the and go to a comunity plase and just listen to anything that causes a peopblem. Personially I think that it gives the library a bad name and therefore that get little business.     You know that if you were a parent you really wouldn't want your kids grabbing racest, adult books, and music and you would like for the government to take some the books and music out of the library. I believe that their should be a vote to see if we could have thoughs books amd music removed or atleast put in an adult section in the back.      My main point of this essay is that they either need to have voting for what goes into the library or they need to start censioring the books and @CAPS1's they put in the library and make accessalble to the comunity. The up side to doing that is the library would get mor customers and that means the government would make more money",3,4
4774,"I do not think that materials, such as books, music, movies, and magazines should be removes from shelves if they are found offensive. I think this because people have different views and belifts on certains types of things, with reglion, culture, and sexaually. Some people can be defend by it but other might can be inform and learn new facts that they didn't already know.      People are not going to look at things the same. Eveyone has their own way of life and think differently. If one person feel the book was offensive to them then they would take it off the shelves. One by one people would find other materials offenive and what does it leave us. No more books, music, movies, and magazines.     Let face it everyone have different belifts, values, and purpose but taking a materials off the shelves because they found it offensive is ridulous to me. I say if they find it offensive don't read the book again or the magazine again. Feel offensive over a movie don't watch it again and the same as music don't listen to it again. Easy as that. Materials give us resources and we learn new things. If we didn't have materials like books, music, movies, and magazines we wouldn't be as smart as we is @CAPS1 are. American is about being free and have rhe right to speak our mind. So putting materials off of shelves is not the answer",3,3
4239,They should be aloud to be removed because some books are offensive. Even if they are offensive they can teach young teenagers about their past. The books could be about the kkk or the @ORGANIZATION1. Some young teens like to read books like this so they can learn and see what people went threw. The books could be a school assignment.           The way i see it is if your teenage child is interested in the history or the violence of the past you should allow them to read what they want. Some book such as @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS3 and @CAPS1 @CAPS2 @CAPS6 are great to read for school assignments. These @CAPS6 book's are very helpful to read because you can learn about your history and about the wars at the same time. I think if your child checks a book out from the library he or she should return it in a week.     The library should give the child a certain amount of time to return the book. If the child dose not return the book in that amount of time they should charge them for every day it is late. If the book is damaged they shud charge who ever checked that book out. The book shud be in the condition it was in when it left so other people can check it out after its returned. the library should keep certain books at the library such as the bible and collage books.      The libary should allow @CAPS6 books to each person. Instead of three or four this would keep books on the shelfs. It would also keep people from loosing books. I think people under twenty @CAPS3 should not be aloud to check out movies or music. I think they should have to show i.d. to prove there over twenty @CAPS3. there should be more rules then just being quit in the library they should make people start keeping books at the library and only allow them to take home @CAPS3 or @CAPS6 books. For instance i check out @CAPS3 book every week and return the @CAPS3 i checked out the same day i go to get a new @CAPS3. I only check out the book i really want to read and i read it and return it. The magazines should never be checked out.,3,3
3802,"How would you feel if you were forced to only enjoy the exact things that everyone else enjoys? If you were limited to only certain subjects because all of the other choices were thrown out you might begin to feel trapped. Everyone in this world is different from the next person. So I believe that each person should be able to read any book they would like without any restrictions. Some reasons for my opinion are personal values, unique interests, and the fact that people should have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others.     For my first reason goes along with personal values. For example a person of higher authority @MONTH1 find a particular book, magazine, or movie inappropriate due to their values and beliefs. So if this person is the owner of the library they would be able to throw out all books and movies pertaining to that topic. This would make it unfair for the people who do enjoy these topics.      My next reason is that every single person has their own unique interests. If someone begins to dispose of books that they are not interested in the library will lose all of the visitors that do find that topic enjoyable. This can cause the library problems and be a disappointment to those who find reading about that certain topic a great way to pass time. Everyone likes different things and has different views. They should not be forced to read only the things that are selected by another person.     People should also have a right to read the books that they like without judgement from others. I know from experience that being ostracized for doing what you enjoy is completely unfair. If everyone did the things that every other person does our world would not accomplish anything out of the ordinary. Many people find inspiration from books and movies so if these were limited to only particular subjects people would begin to feel pressured to be the same. Every person should have a right to enjoy the things that make them happy without being hurt by the opinions and judgements of others.     Books should be something that each person should have a choice in. If there are endless choices of books and movies a person could learn about many different things and develope a more open mind. If everyone in this world opened their mind people would become more accepting of others. So I believe anything that is published should be there for the public to read. No one should be limited because of other people's values or interest. The right to read the books, magazines, and watch the movies you like should always be present.",4,4
3016,"One essential right that every man, woman, or child should have is the freedom of speech. Without this right no one would be able to express their views. When libraries pull books, magazines, movies, and music off of their shelves it takes away that right. Even if the matter of the subject is offensive to some people, the books or other items should be left on the shelves.      What one person finds offensive another could find miraculous. If one person does not find the content of a book attractive then simply do not read the book. Libraries should not censor the material that they put on the shelves just because someone does not like it. I do think however, that books should be placed in the secton that they belong. Sections for childrens books, young adult books, adult books, and many more can all be found in a library. An example would be that a book about the anatomy of the human body does not belong in the childrens section. beyond this, the library should leave the rest of the decisons to the reader. If someone wanted to read a book on the @LOCATION1, then that person should be able to go to a library and check the book out. The problem with censorship is that a @CAPS1 could find the book offensive and want it removed from the shelves. Then the person interested in the @LOCATION1 would not be able to withdrawl the book.     The choice of what material you read should be left up to you, not restricted by what someone else finds offensive. Libraries should not remove items from their shelves if someone else finds it offensive to their own beliefs. The person should just not read the book. Everyone is going to have a different opinion on most things and therefore, there should not be censorship in libraries",3,3
3730,"Why censor things? When there's always going to be someone out there wanting to read a book or magizine that others think should be censored. If this visious circle would continue then we wouldn't have any books left at all to read.     Theres lots of things out there that some people dont like but that doesn't give them the right to take it off the self. Then by doing that and taking it off the self just because they didnt think it was an apropriate book. Will leave someone with nothing to read now.     If the books or magazine would start being taken off the selves then we would have less ways to research or learn certain things. Even though there might be graphic pictures or writing in books or magazines doesn't make them inaproprieate. It needs to be labled on the book that it has it in there. If you see the mark and you dont want to look at it then you dont have too.     We need to code books for different ages. Then parents could be happy if there little boy or girl could only read certain books because of how old they are. Then if parents give permission then children could read books that were ment for older kids or adults.     Even though im not the biggest fan of reading but i will sometimes pick up a book that has things for me to learn in it about an engine. I dont think that people should be able to restrict anything and take it off the selves everyone has there own right to read the book or watch the movie, etc. But children are different because they dont need to learn all those things at an early age. So parents can pick what they can read. but if your an adult you should be able to read, listen, or watch whatever you want to.",3,3
4314,"There are a lot of issues concerning offensive material that are used for entertainment purposes. Sometimes these things should not be on the shelves. Such as movies, books, magazines, etc., they can be seriously offenseive to other people that are different races or different religions.     Censorship can be used to solve this problem, like in the book @CAPS1 @NUM1, it was used to keep books out of the picture completely. To keep the society from becoming offended, or for that matter, thinking. However in this matter it is the complete opposite, having all kinds of negative material and not caring what it can do to other people, or @MONTH1 damage other people.     However this can also be argued. The people that are offended by the material, wether religious or race, really don't have to be around the material in the first place. For example if the material is in a library, then the people don't need to go to the library.           In conclusion people don't have to be near the offensive stuff if they are offended, but people should not be so cruel also.",3,3
3312,"'@CAPS1', the woman shreaked as she had just received a fierce, sharp,and quick stab in the back by her abusive husband. This is the kind of violence children read about all around the @CAPS2. To think all of the innapropriate stuff children see around the @CAPS2 in television, the internet, and even what classmates are talking about isn't enough, well you are wrong. Some of the things you read and hear about in books are totally unacceptable. This is why books, and magazines need to be censored in libraries all around the @CAPS2.     In our community library in @LOCATION1, @LOCATION2 we have magazines, in which case these magazines are very graphic. Kid's will read these over any learning or interesting book. Many kid's draw disrespectful things in them. As to think that wasn't ignorant enough they also rip them in half and do many other dismantling things to them. One of the reasons why I feel that the @CAPS2 has so much trouble with criminal people is kids feel these days that they are allowed to draw in books and rip them in half even though they aren't their property. Which allowes them to think they can do whatever they want. Kids read about crazy things that aren't necessaarily teaching you anything. Unless that is you want to learn about having a zombi apocalypse and zombies take over the @CAPS2. To have that in a school public library what is that teaching kid's? Absolutely nothing, but to teach them to take them home and show there little brother or sister a cuss word in the book is teaching them bad things. These are all some valid points as to censor or take out some of the leisurely reading books in the libraries, or to possibly censor some of the cussing.     The last point I will be touching on this discussion is the loss of money that some of the schools have due to damaged books and stolen property. Also to mention all of the dirty pictures kid's draw in the magazines and books. Schools lose a great deal of money just to touch that point. They would save a much needed amount of money if they didn't let those books leave the classroom or school library. Kid's wouldn't be able to draw in them or steal them or even damage them and all the money they could save and put it towards something learn fulfilling.     Well behaved children all around the @CAPS2 is what you can look forward to if you censor books and magazines all around the @CAPS2 in libraries. If you dont let them be taken out of the library how could kids possibly damage or steal or even draw in them. By not allowing kid's do do whatever they want and showing some authority lets kid's around the @CAPS2 know they need to show some respect. With all the money libraries and schools save they can put it towards something learn fulfilling. If you could please take the information i have given you and think about it, it would be greatly appreciated",4,3
4732,"Have you ever read or seen a book that you thought was not appropriate? Did you want to ban the book from the library you got it from? Well many people have experienced this and many of them have wanted to have more sensorship in libraries but we can not always do this. Maybe that book that you just put down, deeming it inappropriate for all to read it, is someone else's favorite book. You @MONTH1 never know but maybe someone might think your favorite book is not appropriate. There are many different people in the world and they all have different opinions. So instead of banning them how about libraries and schools just sensor them.      Censoring seems like a no brainer but a lot of people do not think about it. We can not just close our eyes to all the inappropriate books out there but we can at least censor them. Censoring them could be as simple as just putting a tag on them or making a different section for just those kinds of books. The tags should be clearly marked so that people can see it and know what to expect from the book.                    People do not have to get rid of some books completely but they need to recognize that young children could pick it up and start reading it without knowing that it is not very appropriate for them. Parents do have the right to check and monitor what their child is reading. Although if you just get rid of the book completely, people are also getting rid of other people's freedom of speech. No one has the right to determine what books are not appropriate and what books are, so no one should have the right to just have certain books just removed from the shelves.      Instead of banning the books or complaining about it them, people could try a rating system for books. When you buy movies a lot of times people check the rating on the movie to see if it would be appropriate for their child or even for themselves. This is what we could do with books too and maybe there will not be as many problems with books. It sounds simple enough but people need to take action and start to do something about it.     You @MONTH1 not be able to make everyone happy but at least people can be more informed about the books they are reading. If everyone can help out in the effort to make our libraries and school more censored than all the libraries would be a lot happier places full of adventure",4,4
3459,"I do not believe that books should be censored. I believe that if it is on the shelf then anyone can pick it up. The books at the library are on a shelf and little kids grab them everyday so why cant they read them if there in their sight. I've gone in libraries plenty of times and in all my experiences I have never come across an offensive book. If the books are offensive I believe that they would not put the books out for everyone to see.     All the times I go to the Libraries I have never come across a book that was offensive. I think that if they allow some commericials to be put on television then why can't some books be put on display.I believe that reading sharpens the mind and if a kid picks up an adult but who are we to say no you can not read that. The Libraries should not watch what they put out on the shelves because if you believe you should not read that certain book you would not pick it up in the first place. If your child picks up a book that you dont want them to read then you should not have taken him in the store in the first place.          If you do not like the music selection that the libraries have then go to a different store. The libraries have bigger issues to worry about then your personal taste of music. If you do not like certain magazines that they have then order magazines online. There is no reason why you shopuld have any compliants to a library the library is a place to help you. It is no mandatory to go to one if you do not like what they have then do not to the library.     Those are some valid points on why I believe that books, magazines, movies, and etc. should not be censored. If you dont like the movies they have don't go to the library. If you think their magazines are inapproapriate then order magazines online. If you don't like there books then order online or go to a book store. That is why I believe books should not be censored.",3,3
4195,"There are many forms of entertainment in the world today.  Almost anyone has access to movies, magazines, newspapers, music, books, television and radio.  While these examples @MONTH1 seem relatively innocent, there are many cases where they can be found very offensive.  When the book, magazine or movie was create, it @MONTH1 not have been made to be offensive.  A group of people @MONTH1 find something very offensive that most other people wouldn't even think about.  There are many types of consumers and it is hard not to offend anyone due to the wide variety of people.  Certain materials, such as books, music, movies or magazines should not be removed from the shelves, even if they are found offensive.     The act of censorship in libraries, or anywhere, should be looked down upon.  No one is being forced to read a book or magazine, watch a movie or listen to music.  If someone finds a book offensive, then the solution is simple: don't read it.  Others @MONTH1 find the book to be inspirational and uplifting, and taking the option of reading it away from the person is wrong.  There are many forms of entertainment that could be taken the wrong way and be offensive to people.  To take away any book or magazine that could be offensive to any group of people would be a large task.  Taking away all offensive books would do away with a large portion of books available in libraries.  If a person doesn't want to read a book because of the offensive nature of the book, then he can leave it on the shelf and pick a different book.  The book should not be taken away from other people just because someone @MONTH1 be offended by it.     Everyone has a different view on things.  Many people @MONTH1 think one way about something, while other people think of it completely different.  This is why all different forms of books, magazines, radio and music could be offensive to people.  For example, a person @MONTH1 be offended if a book talks about a certain topic while another person thinks nothing of it and reads on.  This person @MONTH1 enjoy the book and pass it on for others to enjoy.  If it was taken off the shelves because it offended the first person, no one would have the option of enjoying it.  Just because something is offensive to one person, does not mean it is offensive to everyone.     I believe that censorship in libraries is wrong.  There are many personal reasons why someone @MONTH1 be offended by something, but that doesnt mean it should be taken away from the general public.  People @MONTH1 miss out of a very good book or movie if it is removed from the shelves due to someone being offended by it.  If a person finds a book, for example, to be offensive, they can easily stop reading the book and pick another one.  No one is forcing them to read something they don't want to.  Also, the book @MONTH1 be very enlightening to another person, and removing it completely would be unfair to them. Censoring the content in libraries is wrong.",4,4
4764,"Debates are a main part of our society today. Everyone has an opinion on how things should be in the world, and no one is necessarily right. Books that show how other cultures behave, that to the people being described in the book @MONTH1 seem offensive, are important because we as people need to absorb as much as we can about other cultures. Our businesses are in other countries, many people living in @LOCATION1 speak multiple languages, and people have the right to read things that @MONTH1 in fact be offensive to a race of people.       Businesses thrive in other countries. A lot of our countries income is from our factories and companies in other countries. @LOCATION2 is a place where much business happens for the @ORGANIZATION2. If we, as @CAPS1, can't learn about the @CAPS2, how can we learn their business methods and way of life? To the @CAPS2, these books @MONTH1 be offensive, but to us they are learning tools descirbing @CAPS2 culture.     Being bilingual is a trend that millions of people adhere to. High schools require that we learn some foreign language, even if it is only the basics. The schools do this so that we can go to other countries in the work force. Learning about their language and habits comes from books. The mexican population might not like the way we depict them in our stories, but this is necessary to learn about them.     In the @ORGANIZATION1, there are all kinds of freedoms that we as @CAPS1 use freely. Freedom of speech says that we can say whatever we want when we live in @LOCATION1. Books are not excluded from this rule. I'm sure that other countries have offensive books about us. It's a common theme around the globe.      Businesses thrive in foreign countries, so we must be able to read some books about them, even if they seem offensive. Learning new things is something that every school teaches and there should be no limit to what we can learn. If a book has vulgar language and sexual scenes, it should be taken out of the children's section of the library, not banned completely. This is the same case with other populations of people. They cannot take offense to what we have to say, because worse has been said about them than what we can possibly put in a book. Learning is a necessary tool in our society and nothing should be restricted.",4,4
4413,"A @CAPS1 is a place for people of all ages to come and get a book, magazine, music, movies and much more. Libraries are a key essential to learning and helping those with reading skills. Studies show that reading will make you much smarter and able to understand and comprehend well. However, in my opinion, offensive reading, viewing or listening material does not belong in libraries, to some extent.     As I stated earlier, libraries are a place of learning and for developing skills. Books that are for 'adults' can be found in adult type stores or even at a regular local book store. Parents bring their children to the @CAPS1 to support their reading ability and to advance it. They don't want to have to worry about making sure their kids are not looking at anything bad.      A few years back, I herd about a teenage boy that would go into the @CAPS1 about once a week to look for movies that this parnents would not approve of. Later on that boy was caught and punished. If those kinds of movies were not there in the first place, his parents would not of had to worry about it. Almost everywhere you go and everything to see and hear has some type of wrong background to it. Parents should feel okay and worry-free when it comes to letting their kids do something as simple as going to the @CAPS1. This problem can be easily fixed with removing that issue.      I strongly believe that @CAPS1 material should be censored in the way that those who should not see it, can not see it. On the other hand, material such as religious or cultural learning items that people find offensive should not be taken off the shelves. Religious and cultural books, music, movies, and/or magazines are for those to learn. Form what I have seen, someone @MONTH1 want, for example, a book about @CAPS2 taken off the shelf because they are @CAPS3 and might not support their religious ways. I find this wrong because it is a free country that includes freedom of religion and they can't be denied informing others about that religion.     Libraries are a place to feel safe and relaxed. Everyone likes to sit in the @CAPS1 for hours and soak in a good novel. Material that is found offensive does not belong their, unless it is for real educational learning.",4,4
4143,"As a teenager I am trying to grow and find my way in life and find ways to express myself. I do not believe that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines ect.. should be censored in libraries. Everyone has their own opinion on things such as the music we listen to or the books we read. I do believe that younger children like middle schoolers/preschoolers should be censored from violent songs and movies, but for highschoolers and older I think that it should be our choice. I think that if the libraries really believe that a book or magazine is truely offensice they shouldn't allow them to be published. Not everyone is going to like every book or every type of music that is out there. We should be able to get the books that we like from libraries. Like Katherine Paterson said ' And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' If libraries are able to remove books music ect.. because they believe they are offensive there would be no books left for us to read or songs for us to listen to.I believe that highschoolers and older should be able do decide for themselves what kind of books they read or music they listen to. If you dont like a certain type of music dont listen to it, if you dont like the way a book is written, dont read it. No one is making you to read or listen to something that you dont want to. Books that @MONTH1 be offensive to some @MONTH1 be eye oppening to another. In books we learn about war and things that I fing gruesome and unnessisary, but sometimes it is a fact of life and the things we might find offensive in books are usually things that are happening in real life.I do believe that younger children should be censored form books and music that might be offensive, because they are not big enought to know what is right or wrong, and they dont know what to do with violent information in books about war and music with cussing. In conclusion, I believe that libraries should only censor books that are found offensice to parents with younger children and in younger sections of libraries.",3,3
4530,"I think that this kaind of books they maybe sometimes offend to some people that depending of what kaind or type of book, magazine, movie, music don't want to see there and agree and not agree on this because they are some some type of thinks that are not bad for kids like games for they age or music that are appropiate for there age and others like animals, cultures and all that thinks but that only think that I am not agree is that they can not be books, music, magazines, or even movies that have sexual arrasment that type of stuff not go into a library I think that that type of stuff can be dangueres or affencive for some parents and people that have or don't have kids and I think if they are in some libraries that I agree that they need to take that off because I don't want or people want that kids be disrespecfull and learn that type of thinks that they don't go with there educasion and with there age. I desagree too that this type of music that some artist are meading that they are tooking about drugs, gongs and narcotrafic and even sex and I know this because sometimes I heer this on the @CAPS1 and radio that they are sining and this influence to kids to have another directions on their life and us like parents we don't want that for our kids, don't want that fro their future, we want that they have a good future and be succefull and give them the same example to their kids to went they wrog up and  be a parent to and they are going to see what we are tooking about.I been seen it and parts of the world people been kill or people killing at other inocent persons for this type of things more for drugs that they are saling drugs and they are doing money that they are hurting to other people or kids that consume this drugs that maybe can be our kids or some friends kid and sometimes if they don't pay that money that they need to pay they kill them or that police are traying to faind them because are doing bad thinks and I hope that artist, or people that put this on the libraries think firts that maybe they are doing something wrong of steff that are thinking that are doing something good",3,3
4412,"READ WITH @CAPS1     I do not believe that libraries carry the responsibilty to censor reading materials. When a person enters a library, they immediately must infer that, because libraries are place in which knowledge is accumulated, that some of that information they find @MONTH1 not cooincide with what they believe. If a person believes a book is offensive, they can just as easily put it down as they had picked it up.     Obviously, however, there are certain exceptions. Childrens' sections, of course, should be limited to those intended for younger readers. Putting '@CAPS2 and @CAPS3' into a childrens' section hardly seems logical. just as much as putting '@CAPS4 @CAPS5' into the adults section.     In addition, author @PERSON1 once stated that if she was able to ban a book from a library, the same right would have to be given to all other patrons as well. Thus leading to all the books in a library being unable to be read. the knowledge contained within them unknown.     There are, as with any ordinance, exceptions. For example, if a library is intended solely for the use of younger audiences, censorship should hardly be considered a crime. The exclusion of inappropriate items, such as permisquous reading material, keeps childeren from formulating ideas about concepts they @MONTH1 not be able to fully understand.     With all these things considered, banning books from a library hardly seems to be the best course of action. A library should be a place of enlightenment. Opposing ideas should be presented. Leaving the readers to formulate their own decisions about what they believe. Because books are like atoms. When two opposing types collide, a burst of energy is released.",5,4
4644,"Libraries are normally a safe quiet place for people to go set down drink a cup of coffee and read a book/magazine, search the internet, or listen to some of there favorite music.  But, some people don't use it as that.  They think it is a time to goof around and disrespect other people that are trying to have some time just to them selves while there children are away or had a bad day and to regroup and get ready for the next day. But then we ask our selves why do people want to set at a library and read.  Why can't they just check out a book, cd, or magazine and take it home? Why do people think it is such a big deal to be able to check out books, magazines, music, and movies from the library?     I don't see what the big deal is to this! Most counties have a public libarary.  That is meaning they will accept anyone that is interested in looking at there stuff.  Yes, I can see libraries making the person checking out a book sign a letter or document, giving personal information as in a telephone number, address, or credit card number.  The letter would be saying that they have this much time with this book and they needed it back on a certain date or else they need to bring it back in a get it renewed so they can't accuse of anyone stealing a book if they just want it for a little bit longer.  Most places have what they call late fees.  Normally, if someone has a late fee then you aren't going to get that book back because they don't want to pay it so I feel as if giving them a credit card number they can just keep charging there account and get the money that way for the late fees. Because they can just not answer your phone call or they can just throw away a letter that they recieve in the mail from the libabry in the trash.      I know our school library here at @ORGANIZATION1 has always had problems with getting books back and not paying late fees. This problem is sometimes a never ending process with certain people because some of them just don't care.     Yes, the internet would be a little diffrent because not everyone has money to get the internet at there house.      I am not writing this letter to gripe or be annoying I am trying to tell you some of my ideas that I have to keep a library up and running and not all junkey.  My ideas to me are good ideas and I feel like we can put Libraries into good use around this county and @LOCATION1",2,3
3868,"Whose to say what is appropriate for whom? whose to judge right and wrong for anyone? It depends on a point of view like most things. The sheltered must learn one day, and if kids learn now about the truth, such as, not to stick forks in outlets, then they won't be as curious when they are older. Being sheltered is not always a good thing and censor ship of what we read, watch, or listen to is ridculous, and disrespectful to authors.          In matters of censorship, I find it to be pointless. Censorship doesn't prevent your kids from learning about anything, except mother won't let me watch that. it just keeps your kids more curious and more obligated to hide things from you and like they cannot ask you questions or be open and honest with you. Causes children to go behind your back more and when they're in trouble they'll as if your they're last place where they can ask for help, where you should be they're first resort.         No, I do not believe that libraries should censor anything. Its altering a authors work. How would it feel if you had written something and it had been published and was in the library and didn't like something about it so they decided to just bleep it out or not allow certain people to read it? I believe censorship should be illegal not required.          Sheltering things from kids prevents them from maturing, and discovering the real world. The idea that the world has no evil, or hiding the evil from your children will in most cases cause them to rebel and in other cases leave them unprepared for the future and the real world. Wouldn't you rather be able to help your kids and teach them about things instead of tell them that everything is perfect and only bad people use that kind of language. Or make them feel like a bad person for do something your grandparents did when they were young?      I conclude that censorship is injust, unfair, and is the real wrong. Not the profanity or the violence that will one day be apart of their life in some way. You don't go through everyday in the 'real world' with a mindset of there's nothing wrong in this world. Or everything is censored and everything is controlled  I believe censorship is just another way of controlling the mind through nuture",4,4
3117,"Going into a  @CAPS1 everyone has there own opinons as to what they should see on the shelfs, and what should be put out on the shelfs for everyone to see including children of all ages. Some people @MONTH1 agree that there should only be thnigs that is age appropiate for everyone, others disagree.           In my opinion when im looking at this topic, i think that there should be books for everyone to read no matter what the age group, but there should also be a kid section. If parents are so concernced about what types of books their children might see at a library then they could just put them in the children section to view those. There is no reason in the world that there should not be able to be a variety types of books out.          When it comes to looking at magazines, movies, and music i still have the same opinion to a certain aspect. There should be able to be all types of music out on the shelfs, because its not like people can listen to it by looking at the @CAPS2. But my opinion on the magazines, and movies could vary. There is a certain extant for movies, and magazines. I think they should all be aloud on the shelfs, minus any pornography.           The reason i think like this is because, kids should not have that big of an affect on what they place on the shelfs at a library. Parents just need to be responsible and look for what their children are looking at , and pay attention to them. But when it does come to the pornography that should not be exposed in a public place such as a library. There is some where to draw the line, in any situation and thats where i think it should be drawn at a library.",3,3
4066,"Libraries have books, magizines, movies, ect.The library is a wonderful place to read in a quite place.It can also be an offensive place to some people.They think they can complane and bikker about it, But should all those activities be removed from the library shelves? But whose oppenion is it anyways.          If I found an offensive book, movie, or magizine on a shelf at a library I would just leave it. Apparently its not a bad thing because if it was they wouldnt have it on a shelf. So if I got offensive by it I wouldnt look at it or pick it up. I mean its that simple.A library is full of well, about everything you would enjoy. Many diffrent people like diffrent books and movies to read and watch, that means the library has a right to put what ever they @MONTH1 want. Even if it is offensive to some people.           With my experences in a library nothing has came across to be offensive to me. Im a kind of person that dosen't care. However I have seeen so books ware the author is making fun of the @CAPS1 people. Also @CAPS2 seen a book ware the author is writting about the black people and how they used to be treated and some of the book has the @PERSON1 in it witch is a major racism to black people.                   It could be a unfair situation to some people that have kids with them and a inapropreate book is on the shelf and they see it. That could be offensive to the children and the parents .Or it could even be in a magizine. But why should the books magizines and ect.. be tooken off the shelfs when its not effensive to all people? If the libraians took all the offensive books off the shelves then there wouldn't be any left. Everyone has diffrent things that can offend them. If you dont like how the book is you can take it to your friend and they can read it or you can just turn it back into the library. You can also talk to the library manager and tell them the issue with the offensive it has given you.      Books, movies, magizines and ect are all in a library. They could be offensive or not.

3328,"In my opinion I think that censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries.I think that people are smart enough to make their  decisions on what they want to read. Their are a few reasons why I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries or out in public. The first reason why i think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is becuase it's showing disobedience. The second reason I think censorship shouldn't be allowed in libraries is because many people will overuse their authority, and it'll make many people have a bad review for that library. The last reason why I think censorship should not be allowed in libraries is that it'll change the whole enviroment of a library.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because it shows a form of disobedience. I think that many people will use profanity and will have an I don't care attitude. If people use profanity at home im a strong beleaver on leaving it at home and not bringing it out in public. Censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else in my opinion.     Censorship should not be allowed in libraries because many people will overuse their authority and most people wouldn't want to come back to the library. Some people overuse their authority by being loud in the libraries preventing others from reading or during something to occpy themselves. If a library is loud and obnoxious it'll drive people away from the library. I think that a library should be a nice quiet welcoming. That'll make the library much flow by easier.     At the of the day i think that censorship should never be allowed in libraries or anywhere else public. A library is a place to go read, study, complete homework assignments etc. And finally i think that people should be able to make decisions on their own rather they want to read a book with censorship or anything to do with censorship as long as they can controll it",3,4
3547,"To who @CAPS3 @MONTH1 consern,         I belive that books,movies, and magazines should not beremoved from the shelfs of a library if they are found offensive. @CAPS2 books @MONTH1 seem offinsive to @CAPS2 people but to others there prospective is a lot different. I belive that if books or other things are found offinseive they should have  a speacial place for them, to where mature people will be able to read them. Books are very valuable to most people in the united states.      Many people love to read stuff that other people might find offensive. But is @CAPS3  really wrong for them to like something that someone else took the time to write. Just because one person  reads a book or magazine and they find something in there that they do not like they call @CAPS3 offensive. I have a feeling that alot more people would feel the same way.      Along with movies,and etc. I feel like none of them should be removed from the shelves of a library. There are kids sections, @CAPS1 sections, And even a teenage section. I feel like parents now in days dont want thier children to learn about stuff early in life. But i still feel like if they did not want there kids reading @CAPS3 then dont let them.     If there ever was a need to really look at something and give @CAPS3 another chance this  would be the topic right here. Libraries all over the world are all neat and organized. So why could they not make a section just for books, movies, magazines that people find offinsive. Sure @CAPS3 might take a little bit more work but hey, @CAPS2 one has to do @CAPS3.      As you can see these are really good reason why they should not remove stuff that other people find offinsive  from  libraries. I mean half of the stuff they find any way are based on true stories or they are biographys. People really do enjoy alot of these books and even movies,or magazines. @CAPS3 would be really great if this could happen, @CAPS3 would make a lot of people happy and satisfide.",4,4
4149,"I don't believe that certain material should be taken out of our libraries. If they take the books that people get a learning expresion off of then what does that leave us with. Everybody in life should have there own chocies, we shouldn't limit them.It's all about making chocies in life, people should get the right to read the books,magaizes, ect they want, With out people looking down on them or thinking the material they receve is unatural. What one person @MONTH1 think is not good read the next person might think the total oppoiste.     Music is a creative aspest in our world, @CAPS1 person you meet are not the same so @CAPS3 should music be. You can't have the same ideas when it's comes to making your creative looks on the music in your community it's not going to turn out the same as everyones elses will. If that was the case then the world would be one boreding place to live in. I think that @CAPS1 one has there on taste in music. If your the right age and your not hurting anybody, Then whats the big problem listing to the music that incourge you to become creative.      There are alot of movies that some parents might think that they are not good for there kids to watch. I think that we shouldn't be so worried about what our kids are watching and more what there doing. I think that @CAPS1 movie you watch has a sercet point in it, In other words the lesson learned in the story. Some solutions that happen in real life might be on a movie that's probably rated @CAPS2. I don't believe that we should be focus on the rating of the movie, We shold be focus on the lesson the movie is teaching you.               The children in the world are going to have to make there own chocies and what they find intresing, @CAPS3 should we band everything we thinks thats not. We need you let the children grow on there own and aslo learn on there own. Can't make somebody listen, read or watch what he want them to.     In conclusion we need to let not just kids but everyone have the chocie there want.The world is changing everyday so we need to change our ideas with it",3,4
4366,"I do agree with this topic at hand, some of the material that is being displayed on the shelves at our local library is inappropite or sometimes valgar. Way too @MONTH1 people get away with way too many things in this day and age. Our society we live in is just a total wreck and complete, utter disaster. Something has to be done to put an end to this madness.     Someone would think that if a librarian put an inappropite book up on the self, that @CAPS1 is inevitable that a child or someone irresponsible would find the book. Yet we still witness children reading or looking at a book, type of media, or entainment that is not suitable for their age group. Sometimes adults find books that are not pleasing, why would we put them on a self to be publicly displayed? That is a question that I have yet to find the solution to.     I got home from school a couple of days ago and I heard this hip-hop music comming from my nine year old sister's room. I started to listen to the lyrics and they were absolutley awful, @CAPS1 was singing about drugs, sex, and alcohol. I went in her room and turned @CAPS1 off and questioned her where she got the @ORGANIZATION1 from. She replied 'the library.'     That's just another example of what I'm speaking about. If someone at the age of nine can check out a @CAPS2.D. like that, then imagine what is avalible to me at the age of sixteen. Adolessence do not need those kinds of thoughts and words in their vocabulary. I'm just afraid for the next generation; what are they going to be listening to? What are they going to be reading?     And @CAPS1's not just the library, @CAPS1's everywhere! We can't even live a day of our lives in this society with out hearing something bad on the radio, on tv, or even in public. Everywhere we turn is something bad or valgar. So we need to think about ourselves and our children and try to clean up our acts a little bit. We need to stand up for what's appropite and what's right",4,4
3700,"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf--that work I abhor--then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us'.  Although I understand her message, I don't completely agree with it.   I believe most things such as books, music, magazines, etc. should be censored in some cases.       One reason why I think there should be censorship is because of minors that @MONTH1 want to see things that @MONTH1 not be suitable for them.  First of all, children often follow after what they see.  For example, adutly trends that they see on the television. Not all things adults do are not appropriate for the young eyes.That's why I consider that the things that are broadcast should be censored. Children are being influenced by things that they see, read and/or listen to.     Another reason why I believe there should be censorship is because of a lot of very explicit action that appears in today's movies, books, magazines, and music.  Violence is a main topic  in newspaper articles.  For instance, most front page content is about the wars and hostility in the world.  It is hard to believe that we ever had a peaceful day without any violence. Disrespectful acts, cussing, and rude gestures are not a positive way to keep a more mature role going that will make a better environment.  Because libraries are public, they are open to all eyes so we must be careful about what we allow on their shelves.     In addition, censoring is the correct thing to do.  Where would it lead us if we don't? Do we want our society to be badly influenced by a bunch of profanity, violent slogans, or jargon?  Shouldn't we all want to be treated with respect and common courtesy and avoid promoting outrageous movies, music, and books on the shelves of our public libraries for everyone to see.     So now you can see why I believe that such things like books, music, movies, magazines, etc. should have some type of censorship.  We don't want all the disrespect in the country, so why make it available in our public libraries?  Keep these things separate: adult books, magazine, movies, music, etc.",4,4
3355,"I don't believe any of those materials are offensive if found in a library. But if the childrens look somewhere else to find those things then they will find them anytime. The offensive materials are out there to be pick up by some people including children.     The books aren't offensive only if found in the adult area. If so found there the children would'nt read it because it's too long for them and the book doesn't have any pictures in the book. Music is offensive but like I said only found in the adult area. Kids aren' interesting in music at that ageso they would'nt bother to see them. Movies and Magazines have offensive things in it and can be found any where, but found in a library is gonna be rare. The only thing you will find in a library that is offensive is gonna be a magazine.they make a bunch of different type of them, and can be found anywhere.     To explain the offensive, and the none offensive books that are out there. I'm gonna talk about '@CAPS1 @CAPS2.' @CAPS3 book has a lot of bad words, sexual scenes, drugs, gang violence, racism. @CAPS3 book is so offensive that the childrens parents would'nt let them read it, but @CAPS3 book is based on a true story. Everything that happened in that book was real, and people need to know what happened and why were the people in that story doing those things. Some books @MONTH1 be offensive but you can learn from others mistake by reading that book.     Everything @MONTH1 be offensive to you in one way, but looking from the other point of view it's a learning experience. People that made those mistake could tell the childrens that those stuff aren't wroth it. Everything has it's purpose. The books can tell you the story of peoples life, and the movies are based from the story and instead you can watch it. Music can tell you the life of people by poetry. Magazines really dont have a point their just there to gossip",3,3
3647,"There are many books, music, movies, and magazines that people find offensive. Some people even believe these things should be taken off the shelves. I do not believe that the books, music, movies, or magazines should be taken off the shelves completely. Not everyone finds these things offensive and they should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them.     First, people have different views on what they find offensive. Not everyone will find the same things offensive or want the same books or song to be removed. With people always having different views it is difficult to take books, music, movies, or magazines off the shelves for everyone. Just because one person does not agree with what is being said in the movie or book does not mean that every single person wants that movie or book to be removed. If one person found my favorite book offensive I would not want it taken off the shelves completely.      Equally important, if every book, song, movie, and magazine that someone finds offensive is taken off the shelve there would not be many books, movies, songs, or magazines left. Author Katherine Paterson once said, 'But if I have the right to remove a book from the shelf-that work I abhor-then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' @CAPS1 is saying that if every single book that offends someone is taken off the shelves there would be no books for anyone to read. People find different things offensive and if everyone took these things off the shelves there would be none left for anyone.      Finally, if someone finds a book offensive they do not have to read it. When someone finds a book, movie, song, or magazine offensive they don't need to watch it or read it. Instead of taking it off the shelves the person could just not read it. Not everyone finds the same books offensive and taking them off the shelves could upset many people. When someone finds something offensive they could just avoid that instead of getting it removed and upsetting other people. If someone was offened by one of my favorite books, I would prefere if they just avoid reading it instead if taking it off the shelves so that I can not read it.      Some people find many books, songs, movies, and magazines offensive. They would like these things to be removed from the shelves permenatly. I, however, do not believe that these things should be removed. Taking these off the shelves could make some people happy, it could also upset even more. Not everyone finds the same things offensive and should not be taken off the shelves because a few people do not agree with them",4,4
4377,"I believe that not all books should be banned, but some books should. For example their are many good books that are banned because it @MONTH1 have a little bit of cussing in them but I believe that is ok, I mean it isn't like the child wouldn't hear the same words maybe even worse if he turned on his @CAPS1. But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion.     For example I read a very famous book called The @CAPS2 of @PERSON3 by @PERSON4. This was a very good book but for some reason it was banned in my @ORGANIZATION1 @CAPS4 so I couldn't check it out. I had to go to the @CAPS3 @CAPS4 to get it. I don't understand what is so wrong with The @CAPS2 of @PERSON3 that it is banned by @ORGANIZATION2. This book @MONTH1 talk of a mischevious youngster who runs away, does alot of differnt crazy activites, and even smokes but this is no worst then what we are exposed too on @CAPS1.     If I was a administrator in a @ORGANIZATION1 I would look at what is the meaning behind the book and what it is trying to express. For example if a book is offensive to some one for instance a book written by the @PERSON1, this piece shouldn't be aloud on the shelve. But if it is a book about the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and the @ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery this would be ok. Because the @PERSON2 book is more hate than anything it is for instance promoting the @PERSON2 and that isnt right. But the book on the @CAPS7 @CAPS8 and the @ORGANIZATION3's view on slavery is a part of our history it shows differnt ways of thinking of the time that we don't really know if they were right or wrong it is just what they believed.     So my point I am trying to express in this piece is that don't hate a book because maybe the language in it or the events in it @MONTH1 not be what you agree with but judge the book because of the message that it is trying to express.Hopefully you will agree with me in this.     But if a book talks about certain things it should be banned, such as hate against other races, or it talks negatively about someones religion. I have expressed my opinion on this matter I hope you agree with me and can maybe convince the @ORGANIZATION1 that they need to take a second look at what kind of books we keep on our shelves and what kind of books we take off our shelves.",4,4
4516,What impact does books that are for mature people have on kids? Recently people are trying to censorship libraries for what they seen what their kids are reading or have been acting lately. I disagree in censorshiping in libraries. Instead of censorshiping libraries maybe have a section for explict books or things for preventing little kids from reading them.     First of all instead of removing all the books maybe you should consider making a section for only for people of certain age. Make a section in at the back of the library and ask for @CAPS1 to confirm that there old enough.This would let the libarary keep all their books and would keep all their construmers happy and the most important keep the parents happy.     Another reason for not censorship libraries would be that the number of construmers would slowing drop. This would make the construmers unhappy and the library drop on its popularity for not having the books that people want to read.     I can also see why they are trying to censorship libraries because of the kids behaviors. With censorship in libraries this would keep the little kids from acting the way they do in a book. But @CAPS2 would be better just to not censorship libraries and keep the people who does read them happy.     At the end I disagree in censorshiping libraries because @CAPS2 would upset the people who read them and probably the library poplurity would drop which means people would stop visiting the library. So people that disagree should act now so libraries can stay how they are now,3,4
4469,"Books in libraries are available to everyone, so who's job is it to decide which ones are appropriate and which are not? This is a very controversial topic. On one side, parents are worried about what their children have access to at local libraries. They believe libraries shouldn't contain any books that might be found offensive. On the other hand, whose job is it to decide what is offensive and what is not? If people are given the right to remove books that they think are not appropriate, eventually libraries will have so few books that it would be worthless to even get a library card.     I believe that it is the job of parents and other adults to teach a child morals and what is right and wrong. If kids have developed morals and values, parents wouldn't have to worry so much about what they're checking out of the local library. Kids are faced with issues of right and wrong everyday, and parents should learn to trust that their child is making the right decision.     As a teenager, I know that people have access to far worse things on the internet than in libraries. If people begin to censor libraries, surely they will begin to censor the internet, and the idea of freedom of speech will be thrown out the window. People have a right to be heard and share their opinions, and who has the right to say that a person's opinion doesn't matter? In my opinion, the act of removing books from a library says just that.      Just a few months ago I had to write a research paper about the @PERSON1, and in order to find information about the topic, I had to check out books from the library. Some of the information I read about the topic was horrible and very offensive, but I couldn't have written my paper without it. Books in libraries have information that is vital, whether the books are offensive or not. Books can be used to teach people lessons on what is right or wrong. By being educated about even the most offensive things, people can learn from them and form their beliefs. Removing offensive books from libraries will not lessen the chance that someone's child will run across the information that they contain. There are many sources for information, offensive or not, and a library is just one of them.      People are responsible for their decisions, and it is each individual's choice on what they choose to read, watch, or listen to. We are faced with choices everyday. Should we watch a movie even though we know it's inappropriate? Should we listen to a song even though it gives off a bad message? Checking out a book from the library requires the same decision. Each person must choose what is right, and it is not our job to tell others what they can and can't do.",4,4
4265,"In libraries, there are of course books. There are mysteries, romances, comics, biographies and anything else that you @MONTH1 be able to think of. There are also magazines, movies, and even cd's that are at the libraries now. Then at libraries there are also those books and magazines. Those books being the ones I would never pick up off of the shelf myself let alone allow my future children to pick up. This is because those books contain material that is not at all conducive to the young person's brain. That is why I would like those books to be cencored so my child would never even know that the books are there.     These books have in them people having sex and smoking drugs and their language in theses books are horrifying! These seem to be the kinds of books that young children have become interested in. They read them at school and get them somehow from their friends. They also find them in libraries and the more they read the more they want to do because they are influenced very easily. They are influenced by books characters that dont even exist some of the time.       There are many reasons of why I feel that the books should be cencored but one of the biggest reasons are that because young people read these kind of books they go out and do what they read in the books. Thinking its okay because somebody that is not even real, most of the time, is doing it. I feel that these books are the reason that babies are raising babies children that are ten are going out having sex and getting pregnant and becoming eleven year old mothers. Where is that even heard of, but it happens and by the time those same children become freshmen in high school, if they even get there, they are carrying the responsibility of the baby they had when they were eleven. Those same children go through life wondering how different their stiuations could have been! So I feel like before these books go and mess up a whole other generation of children why don't we stop it here? Why does another child have to get pregnant at the age of ten for someone else to realize it's time to change things?     Ten year old children are still just babies! The human brain isnt even fully developed until you are in around the age of twenty-five. So these children dont know if what they are reading is wrong beucase they haven't been taught that it is very wrong this is because at that age no parent expects that they will have to teach their not to have sex. Why you @MONTH1 ask, because at the age of ten what child should know about sex? At that age they still like to color and play with baby dolls or they like @CAPS1 @CAPS2 and @CAPS3 they should even be thinking about sex let alone know what it is.      These materials should be taken off the shelves because children reading or looking at these kinds of books and magazines in libraries should not be happening. To stop yet another generation from messing up their lives taking the materials off is the best solution. After all shouldn't a parent get the chance to make sure their child isn't killing their chances to live a happy life in the future?",4,4
3510,"I belive that thier should @CAPS3 be sesorship because we live in @LOCATION1,@CAPS1 belive in freedom and I do to, sensorship is @CAPS3 the way.my thoughts about people that find  a book offensive slould @CAPS3 read the book if thay heard it was a bad book or thay dident like the way the cover looks thats thier problem dont ruin it for everyone els that likes the book.say if two people found a book offensive an five people liked the book dose that mean that it should be removed.What if you where one of thos five people and your favorite book was gone and you asked why and the librariean said 'well two people flaged the book for being offensive so it was removed '@CAPS2 @CAPS3 a book person but one time in school we read a book as a class called farenhite @NUM1 I thought it was a good book for its time,  I head that some people wanted to ban the book and some people did.Two words for thos people @CAPS3 cool.I think if you walk into a librarie you sould expect to see alot of different ideas because thats freedom and the woulds @CAPS3 pefect.So what @CAPS2 saying is thay should come up with a new system for librareis if a majority of people flag book offensive and thay dont want their kids seeing it then thay sould seperate thos books,movies,magazines,ets., from erery thing els @CAPS3 remove them.A message to thos people -If you are one of thos people that finds a picifice book ofensive you should know where thay are and stay out of that side of the librareie.thats my thoughts and views on sesorship in libraries.",3,3
4003,"First, libraries are a good source of information. At the same time a library can have pros and cons to its information. Some information should be only seen by adults. Have you ever wondered what if a child got their hands on an adult book? What's one way we can stop this?     Next, you can find information about everyday life. Through magazine, movies, music and books are ways you can find them out. You have explicit music where the artist curses, and says inapropriate things. There has been books from my past experiences where an author just talked about her sex life. I have a past experience with magazines too, such as '@CAPS1'. All these have to stay out of libraries or put in a section where children can't reach them.     Third, parents should monitor their children when they go to public places anyways. The library should be divided into different parts. Music isn't really necessary at a library. They could throw the music out. Also, at the same time children shouldn't get their hands on the books but they would have to learn about that stuff in life eventaully. The committee should have a contest in which people of any age of the community could write an essay telling their opinion also.     Finally, I've came up with a plan to fix this situation. I personally don't think they should throw these books out because this is how people make a living and some people actually like these things. So they should set up an adult section in the library where you have to be @NUM1 or older to enter and a identification card to prove it. Also, you must have a membership to that department. That way we don't have to worry about censoring these books, etc. Children will not be able to proceed in this section.     In conclusion, libraries are a good source of information. So they shouldn't throw these books, music, magazines and movies out. The library could just set up a different section for certain things and people of certain age. In that way they won't need censorship",4,4
3831,"'Do you bleieve that certain materials, such as books, music, movies, magazines, etc., should be removed from the shelves if they are found offensive?'  No, I do not believe just because someone individually finds something offensive means everyone else does.  Everyone has a different opinion, we're all different.  We need variety of all books, music, movies, magazines, etc..  Censorship is understandable, in some ways.  Without a variety for all would leave everyone less choice.       Your opinions, decisions, outlook on life yourself is one of a kind.  How are you to tell someone they can't listen to a certain song or read a specific book?  Exactly, that doesn't make sense right?  If individuals didn't have options of choices there would be no entertainment.  In my opinion; if someone has such a problem with a certain topic, subject, etc. then leave it alone.  It's a big world with more than just you with your opinion.  Be open minded!     Someone else is probably writing this essay with the total opposite response to this prompt.  It just goes to show no ones opinion is right or wrong.  Individuals should all have individuality.  Without variety, how is that possible? From music, books, magazines, movies, etc.- disagreements are one thing but in questions like this you have to agree to disagree",3,3
3267,"In my opinion, they should not censor books. They should be read the way that the author intended for @CAPS4 to be read. I understand censoring songs and movies, though, so that they @MONTH1 be played on the radio and in the theaters.      The books that are contraversial right now have great messages, and should not be taken off the shelves because everyone should read them. They were written with this language because @CAPS4's the way people talked back then. These books are classics and should not be changed, or removed from the shelves.     In the book 'To @CAPS1 a @CAPS2 @CAPS3' by @PERSON1, they use a lot of bad language, but this is how they talked back then and the author is trying to convey a great message to the readers. @CAPS4 should not be changed     @CAPS4 is understandable that they would change songs and take out the bad language so that they can be played on the radio. When an artist writes a song, they know that @CAPS4 won't be able to be played on the radio if @CAPS4 has bad or graphic language. I don't think they mind changing a few words of their song so @CAPS4 can be played on the radio for all to hear.     The song '@CAPS5 You' by @ORGANIZATION1, they replaced the @CAPS6 word with '@CAPS5'. When he wrote this song, he knew that @CAPS4 wouldn't be able to play on the radio, so he changed a word, and @CAPS4 is still a good song.     Movies are about the same as songs, they can't show a movie in theaters if @CAPS4 is too graphic. They @MONTH1 take out certain scenes, or change a few words, but that doesn't change the movie. Those scenes or words can be put back in the movie once @CAPS4 is sold in stores.     I undertand and respect everyones opinion on this matter, I am just voicing mine. If these authors, or artists, wanted their work to be different, they would've made @CAPS4 so.",3,3
4202,"Censorship has been the topic of many debates involving politicians, @CAPS2 activists, and the everyday citizen. There are groups that believe the government has every right to censor anything that is considered offensive in today's society. Some individuals could argue with this belief by supporting the statement that it is not the government's position to decide what is considered offensive and what is not. I just so happen to agree.      One opinion, mainly supported by people with children, is that books, music, and movies ect. should be censored to protect the younger generations. While it is true that parents should be concerned with what their children are exposed to, if the offensive material that is involved in the everyday life of an adult is completely restricted from an individual as a child how is he or she expected to be prepared and excel in the future? Why do we go to school for atleast twelve years of our lives? We go to prepare ourselves for the challenges of being an adult. We place ourselves in an environment that is specifically created to make us comfortable with the responsibilities of maturity. If not properly exposed to something, there is absolutely no way to be prepared to encounter it in the future.      However, not all individuals support censorship because of their children. There are adults that would like to see no more of today's offensive material for their selves than they would want their children to see. My rebuddle to this is that if you do not want to see it then do not choose to see it. No individual is ever forced to be exposed to anything in todays media. Turn off the television if the program bothers you. Do not read the book or magazine. Change the radio station. Every person is capable of controlling what they hear and see, and it is unnessecary to attempt to remove from society what could simply be ignored.      Lastly, one of the most consistent debates around censorship is that the government should control what is included in today's media. Think back in @LOCATION1's history; when has giving the government more power in our everyday lives ever been good for our society? The reason our forefathers founded our great country was to have the freedom they were isolated from in @LOCATION2. The @CAPS1 of @CAPS2 was created to insure that the government could not attempt to control what they had no right to control. The freedom of speech is not just referring to what comes from an individual's mouth, but what goes into their eyes and ears as well. The citizens of this great country are more than capable of deciding for theirselves what is offensive to them and what is not.     It is the government's duty to protect our country from other countries and groups of people who attempt to break it apart, but not to control what we see and hear. Meeting and debates are held everyday to enhance the quality of our freedom and occasionally to gain more freedom. I ask why some individuals would want to give one freedom we do have away? The @ORGANIZATION1 is one of the greatest countries ever to exist, yet we are too lazy to decide what we are exposed to in our everyday lives? It is time for our society to stop being nurtured by the government and start doing our own dirty laundry",5,4
4572,Alot of people are offeneded by things that are uncenored.  Some peopole think they should be censored and others think it  should not.  Its all a matter of opinion.  I dont think anything should be censored because it takes away from the freedom of speech.     With censorship one can not fully express there self or opinion.  that is way nothing should be censored,1,1
3345,"All of us have rights, all of us have the same chance to express what we feel, think or believe.

A library is a place where we can find all kind of material that can easily answer many or our questions, sometimes some material can be offensive and make a target of people feel unconfortable as well as there is material that can be really helpful through our searching.     If i had the right to remove any magazine, book or movie off the shelf, i would at least think about it before remove it and consider how helpful and worth it it could be for someone that really needs it, and if everybody else had the same right as me, the we wouldn't have any material at all in the library.     Music is a big topic to talk about, we all know there are people that are really used to listen to a type of music that other people can call it as 'rude music' and i could be pretty much offensive for kids. I trully believe it wont be fear for any of us to labeled people because of the music they like, the books they read or the movies they watch.      We need to understand nobody is better than nobody and we also need to respect other people's feelings, its something that we have to work on.",3,3
3343,"Katherine Paterson once said, 'All of us can think of a book that we hope none of our children or any other children have taken off the shelf. But if I have the right to remove that book from the shelf- that work I adhor- then you also have exactly the same right and so does everyone else. And then we have no books left on the shelf for any of us.' I believe that the books and other items should stay in the shelves of the library that censorship in libriaries is unnecessary. As Katherine Paterson stated there will be no books left on the shelves if you take every book off that someone in the @CAPS1  finds offensive. What is offensive to one person @MONTH1 not be considered offensive in another persons point of view. Children, teens, and adults have their own right to choose whatever book they want to read, movie they want to watch , or music they want to listen to. If it is a child or a young teen then I believe that the parents should have a say in what their children read or watch. In my case I am not allowed to listen to offensive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies but that shouldn't mean that it should be taken off the shelves of the library. Just because that is what my family believes to be right does not mean it is the only wat to live.     A person has their own rights to choose what they want to read, watch, or listen to. They can make the choice by the way they have been raised or just because that is what they think is right or wrong. If they think that a book is offensive then they don't have to read it, they have the right to say no and put the book back on the self. If they think that the book is approriate then they can read it and there is no law stating that they have to share the book with anyone else. If there is a book out there that is offensive in your view and you read it there is no reason you have to agree with it. Every person is free to disagree with anything they want to disagree with.      If you are a parent to a child and you are uncomfortable with them reading, listening, or watching something that is offensive you should set the rules early in life with them. Parents should make sure that their children are not reading inappropriate things or listening to offensive music or watching @NUM1 or rated @CAPS2 movies. Therefore, if you are comfortable with your children seeing and hearing offensive things then you don't have to worry about what is out there in the @CAPS1.The things that your children are watching, reading, listening to isn't a problem and if it becomes a problem in the parents eyes then they have the right to stop the children from reading the offensive books or watching the bad movies and listening to the music that the view as offensive. Every parent and family is different, as long as your child knows the rules and what you believe in then there is no need for censorship in libraries.      In my family I am not allowed to listen to offensive music. Offensive music in my house is considered music with curse words in the lyrics. The words that my family considers offensive @MONTH1 be different then what other families consider offensive. I know that I don't want to and can't listen to those certain songs but that does not mean that I can't be friends or be around people that listen to that kind of music. Just because that is what my family believes in does not mean that it should be taken of the shelves of the library or any other place. What my family believes in @MONTH1 not be the right thing in another familys view. Every person has their own right and if they want to listen to that music then they should be able to. My family also believes that at my age right now I should not watch rated @CAPS2 movies. If you took all the rated @CAPS2 movies off the shelves, then half the movies would be gone and that is not fair to the people who enjoy rated @CAPS2 movies. What my family believes @MONTH1 not be what other families believe in. I know what I stand for and I will do what I think is right and I won't listen to offenesive music or watch rated @CAPS2 movies. In no way though does that mean that other children, teens, adults shouldn't enjoy that kind of music and those movies.     In conclusion, I believe that censorship should not be used in libraries. It is every persons own right and they are capable on making decisions that they think are the right thing to do. Parents also have a say in what they want their children to watch, read, or listen to. They can montor what their children are reading, watching, or listening to and if they find it offensive they can stop their children. It is not necessary to take the items off the shelf. In my family, my parents find some types of music and movies offensive and I know when I go to the library or any other place that I won't get those items. I will get the music and movies I enjoy and find age appropriate. Just as in @PERSON2's quote everyone has the same rights and if we all take the items we think are offensive off the shelves, then there will be nothing left on the shelves. Everyone has a different point of view and no one person has the correct or wrong point of view that the @CAPS1 has to follow",5,5
3936,"I think that they shounldn't remove the censorship books in the libraries because so bigger kids can read the books not the little kids because they don't need to here the kind of words in the books.  Also the little  kids has to small of ear to hear and also to small of eyes to even see the words in the book like that.  The bigger kids like in grades @NUM1  should be able to look at the books because it will be word that have heard before.          The books shouldn't be in the lower grade libraries becaues the little kids will ckeack the books out of the libraries, like the books thatis called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3 because it says the n word a lot of times, a other one is @CAPS4 and @CAPS5 becaues says a lot of dirt words like the f, s, and ect.words that they don't need to hear that young of age.       Another reason why it wounld not be fair to the bigger kids if they take away from the libraries becaues they tring to get the out of the libraries so the littler kids don't get the books to take home read at home.  If you are going to take away the books tale them away from the grades @NUM2 becaues the that the book called @CAPS1 A @CAPS2 @CAPS3, and @CAPS4 And @CAPS5 will be bad for those kids to read.     Some more reasons why bigger kids should read the books and why not the little kids shouldn't read the books.  Why should the bigger kids in grade @NUM1 should read them becaues they are bigger then the littler kids are. The littler kids shouldn't becaues we don't want the littler kids to go home and say the words to there mom, dad, grandme, grandpa, and ect.       Now I have come to the end of my persuasive essay for the newpaper about my reflecting on why or why not we should get reid of the consorship in the libraraies.  Also until the next time I right again about this topic and I hopest you like this persuasive essay for the newpaper.",3,3
3704,"Do you think that books, music, movies, magazines and other media material in libraries should be censored? Why should information and knowledge be with held from people? Learning is exceptional for not just only the person reading, but also the human race.     There are two arguments to cenorship in libraries. I believe in not allowing censorship in libraries. In the @ORGANIZATION1, everyone is given the right of free speech. Taking someones work and blocking it because it is 'unorthodox' or 'offensive' takes away that persons' rights. Also, people go to libraries to find something out. They look for knowledge and taking away a persons' learning capacity can be harmful to everyone. When one article gets censored another artical after that gets censored and soon most material will be 'offensive' and 'unorthodox.' We will take away man kind's capacity to learn.     Many reasons support censoring for minor offenses such as: inappropriate language in songs, books, movies, and magazines. Also, obscene graphic material in movies and in magazines. These are small issues that can be blocked and censorships can make a clean version. All minor adjustments and easy to make.     Taking media off the shelves is not needed. The material is not serious enough. Minor adjustments can be made so that people can be allowed to read, listen, or watch. A library is made forwhat the people want to learn. Taking that away is very serious.",4,4
